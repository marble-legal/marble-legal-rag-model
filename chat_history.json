{"Question": [["What is the standard for determining child custody in Georgia?", "In Georgia, the standard for determining child custody is the \"best interests of the child.\" This standard is codified in OCGA \u00a7 19-9-3(a)(2), which requires the court to consider the best interests of the child in making custody decisions. The court evaluates various factors to determine what arrangement will best serve the child's physical, mental, and emotional needs. These factors can include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. The love, affection, bonding, and emotional ties existing between each parent and the child.\n2. The capacity and disposition of each parent to give the child love, affection, and guidance and to continue the education and rearing of the child.\n3. Each parent's knowledge and familiarity of the child and the child's needs.\n4. The capacity and disposition of each parent to provide the child with food, clothing, medical care, day-to-day needs, and other necessary basic care.\n5. The home environment of each parent considering the promotion of nurturance and safety of the child rather than superficial or material factors.\n6. The importance of continuity in the child's life and the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity.\n7. The stability of the family unit of each of the parents and the presence or absence of each parent's support systems within the community to benefit the child.\n8. The mental and physical health of each parent.\n9. Each parent's involvement, or lack thereof, in the child's educational, social, and extracurricular activities.\n10. Each parent's employment schedule and the related flexibility or limitations, if any, of a parent to care for the child.\n11. The home, school, and community record and history of the child, as well as any health or educational special needs of the child.\n12. The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between the child and the other parent, consistent with the best interest of the child.\n13. Any recommendation by a court-appointed custody evaluator or guardian ad litem.\n14. Any evidence of family violence or sexual, mental, or physical child abuse or criminal history of either parent.\n15. Any evidence of substance abuse by either parent.\n\nThe court has broad discretion in weighing these factors and making a custody determination. The primary focus is always on what will best serve the child's overall welfare and development."], ["What is law?", "The term \"law\" refers to a system of rules created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. It is a system that regulates and ensures that individuals or a community adhere to the will of the state. The law is established and enforced by the controlling authority, typically the government, and it is backed by the enforcement of penalties. The law shapes politics, economics, history, and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people."]]}
