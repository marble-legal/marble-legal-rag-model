IN THE MATTER OF SHAQUANDRA A. WOODS.\\n\\n        PER CURIAM.\\n\\n        This disciplinary matter is before the Court on the Petition for\\n\\nVoluntary Suspension of License Pending Appeal filed by\\n\\nShaquandra A. Woods (State Bar No. 579239) seeking the voluntary\\n\\nsuspension of her license to practice law pending the outcome of an\\n\\nappeal of her criminal conviction, filed prior to the issuance of a\\n\\nformal complaint under Bar Rule 4-227 (b) (2). In her petition,\\n\\nWoods, who has been a member of the Bar since 2019, admits that\\n\\non December 8, 2023, in the United States District Court for the\\n\\nSouthern District of Georgia, she was found guilty of conspiracy to\\n\\ncommit wire fraud, a felony, under \\n18 USC § 1349\\n and that her\\n\\nsentencing is scheduled for March 28, 2024. Woods admits that her\\n\\nconviction violates Rule 8.4 (a) (2) of the Georgia Rules of\\n Professional Conduct found in Bar Rule 4-102 (d). The maximum\\n\\npenalty for a violation of Rule 8.4 (a) (2) is disbarment. Woods\\n\\nrepresents that she plans to appeal her conviction. Woods states\\n\\nthat she will notify the State Bar of the final disposition of her\\n\\nappeal within ten days of that disposition and that she will also\\n\\ncomply with the requirements of Bar Rule 4-219 (b). Woods prays\\n\\nthat the Court accept her Petition for Voluntary Suspension of\\n\\nLicense Pending Appeal. In its response, the State Bar recommends\\n\\nthat this Court accept Woods’s Petition for Voluntary Suspension of\\n\\nLicense Pending Appeal.\\n\\n     We have reviewed the record and agree to accept Woods’s\\n\\nPetition for Voluntary Suspension of License Pending Appeal. See\\n\\nIn the Matter of Huber, \\n314 Ga. 426\\n (\\n877 SE2d 243\\n) (2022) (accepting\\n\\npetition seeking an order of interim suspension of license pending\\n\\nappeal of criminal convictions); In the Matter of McIver, \\n303 Ga. 802\\n\\n\\n(\\n815 SE2d 53\\n) (2018) (accepting petition seeking voluntary\\n\\nsuspension of license pending outcome of appeal of criminal\\n\\nconvictions). Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that Shaquandra A.\\n\\n                                 2\\n Woods be suspended from the practice of law in this State pending\\n\\nthe outcome of her direct appeal and until further order of this\\n\\nCourt. Woods is ordered to notify the State Bar’s Office of General\\n\\nCounsel in writing within 10 days of the final disposition of her\\n\\ndirect appeal. Woods is reminded of her duties pursuant to Bar Rule\\n\\n4-219 (b).\\n\\n     Petition for interim suspension accepted. Suspension until\\nfurther order of this Court.

Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion\\n\\nbecause he unequivocally and without variance accepted all exclusive material terms\\n\\nenumerated by OCGA § 9-11-67.1 (a). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.1\\n\\n\\n\\n      1\\n          We thank the Georgia Defense Lawyers Association for its amicus curiae brief.\\n       In reviewing the trial court’s order on a motion to enforce a settlement\\n\\nagreement, we apply a de novo standard of review and view the evidence in a light most\\n\\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Torres v. Elkin, \\n317 Ga. App. 135\\n, 140 (2) (\\n730 SE2d\\n\\n518\\n) (2012). The record reflects that on April 13, 2022, Plaintiffs’ attorney made a pre-\\n\\nsuit offer to Defendant’s insurance carrier, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance\\n\\nCompany (“State Farm”).2 The offer contained numerous specific terms and\\n\\nconditions, including that “State Farm is required to provide written acceptance of\\n\\neach term and condition of this Offer in its entirety in writing within 31 days from State\\n\\nFarm’s receipt of this Offer” and that “[a]s an act required to accept this Offer,\\n\\npayment must be received 41 days after State Farm’s receipt of this Offer.” It also\\n\\nrequired that\\n\\n      [a]s an act necessary to accept this Offer, State Farm must draft and\\n      deliver a limited release that complies with the requirements of this Offer\\n\\n\\n      2\\n        The offer letter specifically provided: “As defined in OCGA § 9-11-67.1 (a)\\nand OCGA § 9-11-1, no answer has been filed and no civil action has been commenced\\nregarding this claim, and based on the provisions of OCGA § 9-11-67.1 (a) and OCGA\\n§ 9-11-1, this Offer is made pursuant to and governed by common law and provides an\\nopportunity for contract formation as identified in OCGA § 9-11-67.1 (c).” OCGA §\\n9-11-67.1 (c) provides: “Nothing in this Code section is intended to prohibit parties\\nfrom reaching a settlement agreement in a manner and under terms otherwise\\nagreeable to both the offeror and recipient of the offer.”\\n                                            2\\n        exactly as they are specified, required, and stated in this Offer, and any\\n       variance between the language of the limited release and the\\n       requirements of this Offer exactly as they are specified, required, and\\n       stated in this Offer, even if minor or accidental, will constitute a rejection\\n       of this Offer.\\n\\n\\nThe offer further stated as follows: “It will be a rejection of this Offer if the settlement\\n\\npayment or any other document sent by State Farm includes any terms, conditions,\\n\\ndescriptions, expirations, or restrictions that are not expressly permitted in this Offer.”\\n\\nState Farm received the offer on April 18, 2022.\\n\\n       On April 26, 2022, eight days after receiving the offer, State Farm wrote a letter\\n\\nto Plaintiffs’ counsel indicating that it was accepting Plaintiffs’ demand and enclosing\\n\\na proposed release and settlement check. In the letter, counsel for State Farm stated\\n\\nthat “‘State Farm agrees that any inconsistencies between [Plaintiffs’] Offer and\\n\\nOCGA § 9-11-67.1 do not invalidate [Plaintiffs’] Offer and the terms, conditions and\\n\\nacts required by [Plaintiffs’] Offer are controlled by [Plaintiffs’] Offer and not by\\n\\nOCGA § 9-11-67.1.’” Plaintiffs subsequently returned the settlement check, alleging\\n\\nthat State Farm failed to accept the offer, and thereafter filed this action on January 18,\\n\\n2023. Defendant answered and filed a motion to enforce settlement, alleging that\\n\\nPlaintiffs had entered into a binding settlement with State Farm. The trial court denied\\n                                             3\\n the motion, finding that State Farm had rejected Plaintiffs’ offer by (1) requiring the\\n\\npayment to be endorsed by all payees; (2) omitting commas in the payees’ names on\\n\\nthe payment; (3) including the claim number, named insured, and date of the loss on\\n\\nthe payment; (4) sending payment eight days after the offer was received; and (5)\\n\\nfailing to deliver a release identical in language to the offer. Defendant appeals this\\n\\nruling.\\n\\n      1. Defendant contends that under the version of OCGA § 9-11-67.1 applicable\\n\\nat the time3 — which was intended to address the unfair tactics advanced by plaintiffs\\n\\nin pre-suit offers — once he agreed to the five statutory material terms set forth in\\n\\nsubsection (a), a binding settlement agreement was created irrespective of whether he\\n\\nagreed with the additional non-statutory terms. Defendant argues that if he is deemed\\n\\nto have accepted the additional non-statutory terms, but not to have complied with\\n\\nthem, Plaintiffs’ remedy is a claim for breach of contract.\\n\\n      OCGA § 9-11-67.1, which was amended in 2021 to require certain material\\n\\nterms, still allows parties to agree to other terms not outlined in subsection (a). See\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3\\n          The statute was amended in 2024, effective April 22, 2024.\\n                                          4\\n OCGA § 9-11-67.1 (b) (1),4 (c). Thus, the 2021 amendment to OCGA § 9-11-67.1,\\n\\nwhich became effective July 1, 2021, does not change the general law regarding\\n\\ncontract formation and settlement formation specifically. That general law provides\\n\\nthat\\n\\n       settlement agreements must meet the same requirements of formation\\n       and enforceability as other contracts. Importantly, there is no enforceable\\n       settlement between the parties absent mutual agreement between them.\\n       That existing law includes the fundamental principle of contract law that\\n       an offeror is the master of his or her offer, and free to set the terms\\n       thereof. And along those lines, an offeror may include terms of\\n       acceptance establishing a unilateral contract, whereby an offer calls for\\n       acceptance by an act rather than by communication. So, if an offer calls\\n       for an act, it can be accepted only by the doing of the act. And if the\\n       recipient of a pre-suit offer fails to perform the act required to accept the\\n       offer, then the parties do not have a meeting of the minds.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Patrick v. Kingston, \\n370 Ga. App. 570\\n, 576-577 (1)\\n\\n(\\n898 SE2d 560\\n) (2024). See also Pierce v. Banks, \\n368 Ga. App. 496\\n, 499 (2) (\\n890 SE2d\\n\\n402\\n) (2023); de Paz v. de Pineda, \\n361 Ga. App. 293\\n, 295 (2) (\\n864 SE2d 134\\n) (2021). In\\n\\n\\n       4\\n        Subsection (b) (1) provides: “Unless otherwise agreed by both the offeror and\\nthe recipients in writing, the terms outlined in subsection (a) of this Code section shall\\nbe the only terms which can be included in an offer to settle made under this Code\\nsection.”\\n                                            5\\n Pierce, we reversed the trial court’s grant of the defendants’ motion to enforce\\n\\nsettlement. 368 Ga. App. at 500 (2) (a). As in this case, the defendants in Pierce argued\\n\\nthat a contract is created when parties agree on material terms and that they need not\\n\\nagree on non-material matters for a contract to form. Id. at 500 (2) (a). We rejected\\n\\nthat argument, concluding that the contract at issue in that case was a unilateral one\\n\\nsuch that\\n\\n      an offer calls for acceptance by an act rather than by communication. And\\n      if an offer calls for an act, it can be accepted only by the doing of the act.\\n      The acceptance by act must be ‘identical’ and ‘without variance of any\\n      sort.’ An offeree’s failure to comply with the precise terms of an offer is\\n      generally fatal to the formation of a valid contract.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Id. See also Atkinson v. Cook, \\n271 Ga. 57\\n, 58 (\\n518\\n\\nSE2d 413\\n) (1999) (“an offeree’s failure to comply with the precise terms of an offer\\n\\ngenerally is fatal to the formation of a valid contract”). For the same reason, we find\\n\\nno merit in Defendant’s contention here.\\n\\n      2. Defendant contends that regardless of OCGA § 9-11-67.1, State Farm\\n\\nperformed all acts necessary to perfect acceptance without variance. In this regard,\\n\\nDefendant argues, inter alia, that the endorsement language on the settlement check\\n\\nis not a “restriction” but a recital of Georgia law governing commercial paper, OCGA\\n                                            6\\n § 11-3-110 (d). The offer provided: “It will be a rejection of this Offer if the settlement\\n\\npayment or any other document sent by State Farm includes any terms, conditions,\\n\\ndescriptions, expirations, or restrictions that are not expressly permitted in this Offer.”\\n\\nThe settlement check sent by State Farm was made payable to “Jaade Moore, Sierra\\n\\nMoore, the Estate of Theodore Moore Jr. and Gunn Law Group LLC” and included\\n\\nthe following language on the back: “MUST BE ENDORSED BY ALL PAYEES.”\\n\\n       Plaintiffs contend that their offer specifically prohibited such conditions and\\n\\nrestrictions on payment because Plaintiffs live in Indiana and their attorney is located\\n\\nin Georgia; thus, Plaintiffs would be required to travel to Georgia to endorse the check,\\n\\ntheir attorney would be required to travel to Indiana, or the check would need “to\\n\\nleave the custody of the law firm so it could embark on a multi-state journey to each\\n\\n[Plaintiff] for signature and then (hopefully) be returned for deposit into the law firm’s\\n\\nIOLTA for final distribution.” Indeed, in order to avoid such a situation, Plaintiffs’\\n\\nretainer agreement with their attorney provided that the attorney may endorse any\\n\\ncheck received due to the case.\\n\\n       The Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) provides that “[i]f an instrument is\\n\\npayable to two or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            7\\n be negotiated, discharged, or enforced only by all of them.” OCGA § 11-3-110 (d). See\\n\\nalso Auto–Owners Ins. Co. v. Hale Haven Properties, \\n346 Ga. App. 39\\n, 55 (3) (b), n.12\\n\\n(\\n815 SE2d 574\\n) (2018). As explained in the Official Comments to the UCC, “[u]nder\\n\\nSection 3-110 (d) the check can be negotiated or enforced only by both persons acting\\n\\njointly. Thus, neither payee acting without the consent of the other, is a person entitled\\n\\nto enforce the instrument.” OCGA § 11-3-420, Official Comment 1.5 See also OCGA\\n\\n§ 11–3–420 (a) (“[a]n instrument is . . . converted if it is taken by transfer, other than\\n\\na negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or\\n\\nobtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the\\n\\ninstrument or receive payment”). Nonetheless, as Plaintiffs point out, under Georgia\\n\\nlaw, an agent or representative such as an attorney who has expressly been given authority\\n\\nmay endorse a check on behalf of a payee without running afoul of OCGA §§ 11-3-110\\n\\nand 11-3-420 (a). See Tifton Bank & Trust Co. v. Knight’s Furniture Co., \\n215 Ga. App.\\n\\n471\\n, 474 (1) (b) (\\n452 SE2d 219\\n) (1994). See also Gerber & Gerber v. Regions Bank, 266\\n\\n\\n\\n      5\\n        “In order to determine the meaning and purpose behind the enactment of a\\nGeorgia Commercial Code provision that is taken verbatim from the UCC, we turn\\nto the UCC Official Comments for assistance.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.)\\nColeman v. DaimlerChrysler Svcs. of North America, \\n276 Ga. App. 336\\n, 339, n.3 (\\n623\\nSE2d 189\\n) (2005).\\n                                            8\\nGa. App. 8\\n, 12 (2) (\\n596 SE2d 174\\n) (2004). Accordingly, Defendant’s claim that the\\n\\nUCC requires the endorsement language at issue here is unpersuasive.\\n\\n       Regardless, as we have explained in other cases, under the 2013 version of\\n\\nsubsection (f) of OCGA § 9-11-67.1, which is virtually identical to the 2021 amended\\n\\nversion, defendants “could have chosen a number of other means to provide payment\\n\\nto [plaintiff], . . . yet they elected a payment method that, according to their argument\\n\\non appeal, could not have satisfied the terms of the offer.” Pierce, 368 Ga. App. at 502\\n\\n(2) (c). See also Patrick, 370 Ga. App. at 576-578 (1) (reversing grant of motion to\\n\\nenforce settlement where “check indicating on its face that it was ‘VOID IF NOT\\n\\nPRESENTED WITHIN 90 DAYS,’ varied from the requirement in . . . offer that the\\n\\nsettlement payment not ‘include any terms, conditions, descriptions, or\\n\\nrepresentations that are not permitted in the release’”) (punctuation omitted).\\n\\nLikewise, in this case, State Farm, on behalf of Defendant, did not have to provide\\n\\npayment in the form of check; it could have chosen another form of payment as\\n\\nspecified by subsection (f) in order to comply with subsection (a). See OCGA § 9-11-\\n\\n67.1 (f).6\\n\\n       6\\n      While Defendant takes issue with what he contends is the ubiquitous\\ngamesmanship on the part of plaintiffs’ attorneys who draft complex, convoluted\\n                                           9\\n       “When, like here, the recipient of a pre-suit offer fails to perform the act\\n\\nrequired to accept the offer, then the parties do not have a meeting of the minds.”\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Patrick, 370 Ga. App. at 577 (1). Because the\\n\\nsettlement check required an additional condition/restriction, the parties did not have\\n\\na meeting of the minds. Accordingly, the trial court correctly ruled that there was no\\n\\nformation of a settlement agreement and we affirm its denial of the motion to enforce\\n\\nsettlement.\\n\\n      3. Given our conclusion in Division 2, supra, we need not address the other\\n\\nalleged deficiencies with State Farm’s acceptance of Plaintiffs’ offer. See Patrick, 370\\n\\nGa. App. at 577 (1); Pierce, 368 Ga. App. at 503 (2) (c), n.9.\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed. Dillard, P. J., and Padgett, J., concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\noffers, “conditioned on a waiver of the protections guaranteed by [OCGA § 9-11-\\n67.1],” as the concurrence intimates in Pierce, what may be perceived as a “trap for\\nthe unwary,” may sometimes be “detail-oriented advocacy.” 368 Ga. App. at 503\\n(Dillard, J., concurring). Much like the plaintiff in Pierce, Plaintiffs here thoroughly\\nexplain in their brief the hurdles required to obtain endorsements from all payees. This\\nobservation notwithstanding, nothing in our opinion should be construed as requiring\\na plaintiff to always assert a reason for why an offer required a specific act to be\\nperformed or prohibited a certain condition or restriction.\\n                                           10\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9506609/william-cole-redfearn-v-jaade-moore/'}),\n",

IN THE MATTER OF ANDREA JO ANNE DAVID-\\n                           VEGA.\\n\\n        PER CURIAM.\\n\\n        This disciplinary matter is before the Court on the report and\\n\\nrecommendation of the State Disciplinary Review Board (“Review\\n\\nBoard”) that the Court adopt the findings and conclusions of Special\\n\\nMaster Adam Marshall Hames, who recommends Respondent Andrea\\n\\nJo Anne David-Vega (State Bar No. 364871) receives at least a two-\\n\\nyear suspension for her violations of Rules 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.16, 3.4\\n\\n(a), 8.1 (a), 8.4 (a) (4), and 9.3 of the Georgia Rules of Professional\\n\\nConduct (“GRPC”).1 David-Vega, who was admitted to the State Bar in\\n\\n2008, has filed exceptions to the Review Board’s report, challenging\\n\\nthe Special Master’s recommended discipline and requesting a six-to-\\n\\n\\n        1 The maximum penalty for a violation of Rules 1.2, 1.3, 3.4 (a), 8.1 (a),\\n\\nand 8.4 (a) (4) is disbarment, while the maximum penalty for a violation of\\nRules 1.4, 1.5, 1.16, and 9.3 is a public reprimand.\\n nine-month suspension. The State Bar did not file exceptions to the\\n\\nReview Board’s report. However, the State Bar did file a response to\\n\\nDavid-Vega’s exceptions, noting that disbarment is the presumptive\\n\\ndiscipline in this case but that it was satisfied with the Special\\n\\nMaster’s recommendation of at least a two-year suspension. We agree\\n\\nwith the Special Master and the Review Board that significant\\n\\ndiscipline is warranted. However, given the facts of the underlying\\n\\nmatter and David-Vega’s admitted violations of the GRPC, we\\n\\nconclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.\\n\\n     The record shows that on June 30, 2020, David-Vega’s long-time\\n\\nclient, Fadi L. Milan, filed a grievance against her with the State Bar.\\n\\nOn or about July 22, 2020, the State Bar mailed the grievance to\\n\\nDavid-Vega and directed her to respond to the grievance no later than\\n\\nAugust 10, 2020. After David-Vega failed to timely respond, the State\\n\\nBar sent her a letter on or about March 3, 2021, and directed her to\\n\\nrespond to the grievance no later than March 13, 2021. David-Vega\\n\\nagain failed to respond to the grievance, and on or about March 30,\\n\\n2021, the State Bar issued a Notice of Investigation against her,\\n\\ninforming her that, based on Milan’s grievance, it appeared that\\n                                   2\\n David-Vega had violated several GRPC Rules. On January 14, 2022,\\n\\nfollowing the investigation, the State Bar filed the underlying formal\\n\\ncomplaint. Although David-Vega acknowledged service of the\\n\\ncomplaint, she did not timely file an answer and, on March 24, 2022,\\n\\nthe State Bar filed a motion for default pursuant to Bar Rule 4-212 (a).\\n\\n     On May 20, 2022, David-Vega filed a motion to stay, asserting\\n\\nthat she intended to submit a petition for voluntary discipline, in\\n\\nwhich she would acknowledge wrongdoing but would include\\n\\nsignificant mitigating evidence. On May 31, 2022, counsel for David-\\n\\nVega represented that David-Vega was in the process of drafting the\\n\\npetition for voluntary discipline and would “share” the petition with\\n\\nthe State Bar and the Special Master “in a couple of weeks.” The State\\n\\nBar informed David-Vega and the Special Master that it had no\\n\\nobjection to David-Vega filing a petition for voluntary discipline and\\n\\nagreed   to   David-Vega’s    proposed    timeline.   Based   on    this\\n\\nrepresentation, the State Bar did not file a formal response to the\\n\\nmotion to stay. However, David-Vega never filed the petition. Instead,\\n\\non July 21, 2022—over four months after her answer to the formal\\n\\ncomplaint was due—David-Vega filed an answer and a motion to open\\n                                   3\\n default. On July 29, 2022, the State Bar filed a timely response to\\n\\nDavid-Vega’s motion to open default, requesting that the Special\\n\\nMaster grant the State Bar’s motion for default and deny or dismiss\\n\\nDavid-Vega’s motion on the ground that the State Bar had relied on\\n\\nDavid-Vega’s representation that she intended to file a petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline and that the State Bar, the disciplinary process,\\n\\nand the public would be prejudiced by opening David-Vega’s default.\\n\\n      On August 8, 2022, the Special Master issued his first Report and\\n\\nRecommendation, in which he granted the State Bar’s motion for\\n\\ndefault, noting that David-Vega failed to articulate a legitimate basis\\n\\nto reopen the default. The Special Master, citing In the Matter of\\n\\nNicholson, \\n299 Ga. 737\\n, 738 (\\n791 SE2d 776\\n) (2016), granted David-\\n\\nVega a hearing on aggravating and mitigating circumstances so that\\n\\nshe could offer evidence related to the recommended sanction.2 The\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 We note that although, generally speaking, the opening of default\\nshould be liberally applied, we cannot say that the Special Master abused his\\ndiscretion in refusing to open the default here, given that David-Vega failed to\\nshow providential cause, excusable neglect, or that this is a proper case for\\nopening default. See OCGA § 9-11-55 (b). David-Vega produced no evidence\\nsuggesting she had been trying to timely respond to the formal complaint,\\ncontinued to practice law during this period, and failed to cooperate with the\\n\\n                                       4\\n Special Master then summarized the facts alleged and violations\\n\\ncharged in the formal complaint, which were deemed admitted\\n\\npursuant to David-Vega’s default. See Bar Rule 4-212 (a).\\n\\n      As recounted by the Special Master, the admitted facts show the\\n\\nfollowing. In August 2016, Milan retained David-Vega to pursue his\\n\\npersonal injury claim based on an automobile accident, in which he\\n\\nsuffered a serious brain injury. David-Vega met with Milan to discuss\\n\\nhis claim and then contacted the liability insurer for the defendants,\\n\\nidentifying herself as the attorney representing Milan. However,\\n\\nDavid-Vega did not provide Milan with a written contingency fee\\n\\nagreement. In March 2018, after not hearing from David-Vega for a\\n\\n\\n\\ndisciplinary proceedings and the concurrent legal malpractice action that\\nMilan filed against her. See In the Matter of Turk, \\n267 Ga. 30\\n, 30 (\\n471 SE2d\\n842\\n) (1985) (declining to allow attorney to open default and noting in part that\\nthe attorney was actively practicing law during the relevant time period). Cf.\\nIn the Matter of Boyd, \\n315 Ga. 390\\n, 394 (\\n882 SE2d 339\\n) (2022) (case remanded\\nfor a hearing on the motion for default where respondent dutifully responded\\nto the grievance and subsequent investigation and alleged that her failure to\\nfile an answer to the formal complaint was based on a series of\\nmiscommunications). We further note that although some facts may have been\\nadmitted only by default, as discussed below, David-Vega also made certain\\nadmissions in her testimony at the hearing on aggravating and mitigating\\ncircumstances, including admitting that she fabricated evidence that she\\nprovided in the underlying disciplinary matter and in the related civil\\nmalpractice case.\\n\\n                                       5\\n “[l]ong time,” Milan emailed her, informing her that his injuries from\\n\\nthe accident had worsened. In May 2018, David-Vega discussed with\\n\\nMilan the status of his claim and his desire to update his will and\\n\\nscheduled a time for Milan to come to her office to sign the necessary\\n\\ndocuments. However, when Milan arrived for his appointment, David-\\n\\nVega was not in the office and had arranged for her husband, who is\\n\\nnot a lawyer, to provide Milan with the paperwork.\\n\\n     On May 26, 2018, following this meeting, Milan emailed David-\\n\\nVega to schedule a time to discuss his case. David-Vega did not respond\\n\\nto Milan, cut off communication with the insurer, and failed to file the\\n\\nsuit by August 2018, at which point the limitation period had run.\\n\\nBetween January 2019 and February 2020, Milan called David-Vega’s\\n\\noffice over 65 times to ask about the status of his case and continued\\n\\ncontacting her via email and text message through April 2020. During\\n\\nthis time, David-Vega’s staff scheduled six different conference calls\\n\\nfor Milan to speak with David-Vega, but David-Vega missed each of\\n\\nthe calls. Occasionally, David-Vega would respond via email or text\\n\\nmessage, claiming that his email had been sent to her spam folder or\\n\\n\\n                                   6\\n that she had another obligation and needed time to respond to his\\n\\nquestions. On April 30, 2020, Milan texted David-Vega the following:\\n\\n     Good morning Miss Andrea I’m glad you’re OK and safe can\\n     we please start somewhere On my case since January of\\n     2019 when I visited your office to drop off some documents\\n     and met your husband and he told me that I will have an\\n     update. Since then I have no update on my case and I called\\n     text emailed for so many times and no one is replying to me\\n     it’s like I don’t exist or I don’t even have a case as I told you\\n     I’m preparing to leave Georgia to state of Florida and I need\\n     to know the status of my case I tried so many times\\n     following up with your office and they keep telling me Ms.\\n     Andrea has the file and she’s the only one know about the\\n     case. I know you for almost 13 years and you always Took\\n     care of me well please update me Thank you.\\n\\n\\n     David-Vega did not respond to this message. On May 5, 2020,\\n\\nMilan notified David-Vega by email and U.S. mail that he was\\n\\nterminating her representation and requested that she provide him\\n\\nwith his file. Less than five minutes after David-Vega received this\\n\\nemail, she texted Milan asking, “Mr. Milan, are you firing me? Why?”\\n\\nMilan and David-Vega had no further contact and David-Vega failed\\n\\nto provide Milan with the requested files.\\n\\n     Milan then filed the underlying grievance with the State Bar and\\n\\na professional malpractice complaint against David-Vega on October\\n                                    7\\n 19, 2020. According to the process server, David-Vega repeatedly\\n\\nrefused to accept service of the malpractice complaint. However, on\\n\\nDecember 23, 2020, David-Vega filed her answer to the malpractice\\n\\ncomplaint, in which she denied that Milan had been injured in the\\n\\naccident, that she agreed to represent him, that she failed to file suit\\n\\non his behalf prior to the expiration of the two-year statute of\\n\\nlimitation applicable to his personal injury claim, that Milan had\\n\\nterminated her representation on May 5, 2020, and that she failed to\\n\\nprovide him with the requested files.\\n\\n      Although David-Vega failed to timely respond to the grievance—\\n\\nor the subsequent formal complaint—David-Vega did respond to the\\n\\nState Bar’s Notice of Investigation against her, providing a sworn\\n\\nresponse stating that on March 18, 2018, she received an email from\\n\\nMilan dated March 9, 2018, in which he advised her that he would no\\n\\nlonger need her services and that she had emailed Milan his entire\\n\\naccident file. Per the State Bar’s request, David-Vega sent several\\n\\nemail exchanges purporting to be between her and Milan. However,\\n\\nthe   March   9   email   terminating   David-Vega’s    representation\\n\\nsupposedly sent from Milan was in a different format and font than\\n                                   8\\n the others and, unlike in the other emails, Milan appeared to use\\n\\nperfect diction, capitalization, and punctuation. Milan denied having\\n\\nsent this email, and the State Bar determined that the email was likely\\n\\nfalsified by David-Vega.\\n\\n     On or about April 1, 2021, Casey Stevens, Milan’s counsel in the\\n\\nmalpractice matter, served requests for production on David-Vega,\\n\\ndemanding all agreements and written correspondence between\\n\\nDavid-Vega and Milan and Milan’s file. Stevens also served\\n\\ninterrogatories upon David-Vega, demanding that she identify any\\n\\nfacts or documents supporting her denial of liability. David-Vega failed\\n\\nto timely respond to the discovery request. On June 23, 2021, after\\n\\nattempting to contact David-Vega several times to ask her to respond\\n\\nto the discovery requests, Stevens filed a motion to compel and a\\n\\nmotion for sanctions. On September 3, 2021, David-Vega filed her\\n\\nresponse to the motions, asserting that she had “responded in full” to\\n\\nthe discovery requests, but was unable to provide any proof. The trial\\n\\ncourt judge granted the motion to compel and instructed David-Vega\\n\\nto send the requested documents and her responses to the\\n\\n\\n                                   9\\n interrogatories by October 14, 2021. David-Vega failed to provide the\\n\\ndiscovery requests in a timely manner, but she did deliver the\\n\\nrequested responses on October 18, 2021. However, the responses were\\n\\nincomplete, unresponsive, and untruthful, as David-Vega claimed that\\n\\nshe had not been named as a party in a civil lawsuit within the past\\n\\nten years, even though she had another professional malpractice\\n\\nlawsuit against her pending since May 28, 2021. On December 9, 2021,\\n\\nStevens filed a second motion to compel, requesting that David-Vega\\n\\nprovide the requested documents and Milan’s file by January 8, 2022.\\n\\nOnce again, David-Vega failed to file a timely response.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  10\\n       Based on these admitted facts, the Special Master concluded that\\n\\nDavid-Vega knowingly violated Rules 1.2,3 1.3,4 1.4 (a),5 1.5 (c),6 1.16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 GRPC Rule 1.2 states in pertinent part that “a lawyer shall abide by a\\n\\nclient’s decisions concerning the scope and objectives of representation and . .\\n. shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.”\\n      4 GRPC Rule 1.3 states in pertinent part that “[a] lawyer shall act with\\n\\nreasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client. Reasonable\\ndiligence as used in this Rule means that a lawyer shall not without just cause\\nto the detriment of the client in effect willfully abandon or willfully disregard\\na legal matter entrusted to the lawyer.”\\n      5 GRPC Rule 1.4 (a) states in pertinent part that “ [a] lawyer shall: (1)\\n\\npromptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to\\nwhich the client’s informed consent . . . is required; (2) reasonably consult with\\nthe client about the means by which the client’s objectives are to be\\naccomplished; (3) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the\\nmatter; [and] (4) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.”\\n      6 GPRC Rule 1.5 (c) states in pertinent part that “[a] contingent fee\\nagreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which the fee is to\\nbe determined.”\\n\\n                                       11\\n (d),7 3.4 (a),8 8.1 (a),9 8.4 (a) (4),10 and 9.311 of the GRPC, found in Bar\\n\\nRule 4-102 (d).\\n\\n      On October 5, 2022, after issuing his first Report and\\n\\nRecommendation, the Special Master held a hearing on aggravating\\n\\nand mitigating circumstances. At the hearing, David-Vega admitted to\\n\\nfabricating the email allegedly sent by Milan dated March 9, 2018,\\n\\nterminating her representation, and also to fabricating a text message\\n\\nto make it appear as though Milan had terminated her representation\\n\\n\\n      7 GRPC Rule 1.16 (d) states in pertinent part that “[u]pon termination of\\n\\nrepresentation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable\\nto protect a client’s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client,\\nallowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and\\nproperty to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of\\nfee that has not been earned.”\\n      8 GRPC Rule 3.4 (a) provides in pertinent part that “[a] lawyer shall not\\n\\nunlawfully obstruct another party’s access to evidence or unlawfully alter,\\ndestroy or conceal a document or other material having potential evidentiary\\nvalue.”\\n      9 GRPC Rule 8.1 (a) provides in pertinent part that “[a] lawyer . . . in\\n\\nconnection with a disciplinary matter, shall not knowingly make a false\\nstatement of material fact.”\\n      10 GRPC Rule 8.4 (a) (4) provides in pertinent part that “[a lawyer may\\n\\nnot] engage in professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\\nmisrepresentation.”\\n      11 GRPC Rule 9.3 provides in pertinent part that “[d]uring the\\ninvestigation of a grievance filed under [the GRPC], the lawyer complained\\nagainst shall respond to disciplinary authorities in accordance with State Bar\\nRules.”\\n\\n                                      12\\n prior to the statute of limitation expiring. She explained that she did\\n\\nnot have a “good answer” for why she fabricated the documents and\\n\\nasserted that she “had so much going on” and “probably should have\\n\\nreached out for help.”12 David-Vega was also unable to provide a reason\\n\\nfor failing to timely file Milan’s claim.\\n\\n      In mitigation, David-Vega called as a witness her licensed\\n\\ncounselor, Jennifer Hawkins, who testified that in 2016, David-Vega\\n\\nexpanded her existing practice by becoming a Special Assistant\\n\\nAttorney General representing DFCS in Gwinnett County with a\\n\\ncaseload of 200 cases. She later acquired an additional 150 cases from\\n\\na neighboring county while still managing her own practice, which\\n\\nhandled family law, business law, bankruptcy, personal injury,\\n\\njuvenile, and criminal law cases. David-Vega became overwhelmed\\n\\nwith her case load, but continued to take cases because she “did not\\n\\nknow how to say no” and felt unable to ask for help. Hawkins testified\\n\\n\\n\\n     12 The record shows that David-Vega submitted the fabricated email in\\n\\nboth the underlying disciplinary matter and the civil malpractice case. David-\\nVega submitted the fabricated text message in the malpractice case but did not\\nsubmit this fabricated evidence to the State Bar as part of this disciplinary\\nmatter.\\n\\n                                     13\\n that David-Vega’s inability to ask for help stemmed from childhood\\n\\ntrauma. Around this same time, she was assisting in providing care\\n\\nfor her mother and stepfather, who had become ill. According to\\n\\nHawkins, David-Vega eventually “reached a point where she\\n\\ncompletely unplugged.” David-Vega then began seeing Hawkins for\\n\\ntreatment and was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and\\n\\nADHD.\\n\\n     Additionally, counsel for David-Vega announced that, right\\n\\nbefore the hearing commenced, the parties had reached a settlement\\n\\nin the legal malpractice claim. As mitigating evidence, David-Vega\\n\\nalso submitted character evidence consisting of depositions of a\\n\\nsuperior court judge and three juvenile court judges, all of whom\\n\\nDavid-Vega had appeared before. The judges described David-Vega as\\n\\n“a hardworking, dedicated, and zealous advocate for her clients.”\\n\\n     In aggravation, Milan testified that he had suffered permanent\\n\\ninjuries to his eye, neck, head, back, and brain as a result of the\\n\\naccident for which he sought David-Vega’s legal representation; that\\n\\nhe had been subject to debt collectors calling and was unable to access\\n\\n                                  14\\n his medical records because they had been sent to David-Vega; and\\n\\nthat he felt betrayed by David-Vega because they had a long-existing\\n\\nattorney-client relationship prior to the accident, as she had\\n\\nrepresented him in nine different matters. Milan’s counsel in the\\n\\nmalpractice case, Stevens, testified that David-Vega had lied on\\n\\nnumerous occasions and failed to cooperate in the legal malpractice\\n\\ncase; that David-Vega failed to show any accountability until the day\\n\\nof the hearing; and that David-Vega had drawn out the settlement\\n\\nnegotiations in the civil malpractice action for two years.\\n\\n     On December 14, 2022, the Special Master issued his second\\n\\nReport and Recommendation, in which he recounted his factual\\n\\nfindings following the hearing on aggravating and mitigating\\n\\ncircumstances and made a discipline recommendation. In determining\\n\\nthe appropriate level of discipline, the Special Master considered the\\n\\nABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (“ABA Standards”).\\n\\nSee In the Matter of Morse, \\n266 Ga. 652\\n (\\n470 SE2d 232\\n) (1996) (ABA\\n\\nStandards are instructive in determining the appropriate level of\\n\\ndiscipline). Those standards require consideration of (1) the duty\\n\\n\\n                                   15\\n violated; (2) the lawyer’s mental state; (3) the potential or actual injury\\n\\ncaused by the lawyer’s misconduct; and (4) the existence of aggravating\\n\\nor mitigating factors. See ABA Standard 3.0. The Special Master\\n\\nconcluded that “David-Vega violated a duty to her client, the legal\\n\\nsystem, and her profession”; that she “acted knowingly”; and that “the\\n\\ninjury to the client was significant.” The Special Master also concluded\\n\\nthat nine out of the eleven aggravating factors set forth in ABA\\n\\nStandard 9.22 applied: dishonest or selfish motive; a pattern of\\n\\nmisconduct; multiple offenses; bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary\\n\\nproceedings; submission of false evidence during the disciplinary\\n\\nprocess; refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of conduct;\\n\\nvulnerability of the victim; substantial experience in the practice of\\n\\nlaw; and the indifference to making restitution.13 See ABA Standard\\n\\n9.22 (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j). Additionally, the Special\\n\\nMaster concluded that out of the thirteen mitigating factors set forth\\n\\nin ABA Standard 9.32, “only a few [we]re in her favor,” as she had no\\n\\n\\n\\n      13 The Special Master found that the only two aggravating factors that\\n\\ndid not apply were prior disciplinary offenses and illegal conduct. See ABA\\nStandard 9.22 (a) & (k).\\n\\n                                      16\\n prior disciplinary history and recently expressed remorse for her\\n\\nactions. See ABA Standard 9.32 (a) & (l). The Special Master also noted\\n\\nin mitigation that she was suffering from personal and emotional\\n\\nproblems and that, apart from the disciplinary matter at issue, she had\\n\\na reputation as a “stellar” and “professional” lawyer among the judges\\n\\nwhom she had appeared before. See ABA Standard 9.32 (g) & (i).14\\n\\n      Based on the lack of prior disciplinary history and the character\\n\\nand reputation evidence, the Special Master recommended a\\n\\nsuspension of at least two years. The Special Master further noted that\\n\\nthe violations admitted by David-Vega, particularly her fabrication of\\n\\nevidence, were among the most serious violations under the rules and\\n\\nthat the Court may decide that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.\\n\\nSee In the Matter of Dorer, \\n304 Ga. 442\\n, 445 (2018) (rejecting petition\\n\\nfor voluntary discipline seeking reprimand for admitted violation of\\n\\nRule 8.4 (a) (4), noting that this “violation is among the most serious\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      14 Although, when discussing factors in mitigation, the Special Master\\n\\nstated that David-Vega’s “core argument . . . w[as] that she was suffering from\\npersonal and emotional problems,” it is unclear whether he found that she had\\na “mental disability” as provided in ABA Standard 9.32 (i).\\n\\n                                      17\\n charges that can be leveled against an attorney—it is a violation that\\n\\ncommonly warrants disbarment”).\\n\\n     We appreciate the Special Master’s careful analysis in this\\n\\nmatter. We agree with the Special Master’s determination that nine\\n\\nout of the eleven aggravating factors set forth in ABA Standard 9.22\\n\\nare applicable to this matter, while only a few of the mitigating factors\\n\\nset forth in ABA Standard 9.32 are applicable. We also agree with the\\n\\nSpecial Master that David-Vega’s false statements as to when she was\\n\\nterminated by Milan and her fabrication of evidence during the\\n\\nunderlying disciplinary proceeding and in the malpractice case against\\n\\nher implicate some of the most serious violations under the Rules, and\\n\\nthat severe discipline is warranted. After consideration of the record\\n\\nin this matter, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate\\n\\nsanction for David-Vega’s violations of the GRPC. We conclude that\\n\\nthis sanction is consistent with prior disciplinary matters in which we\\n\\nhave disbarred attorneys who have made false statements to a tribunal\\n\\nand in connection with disciplinary proceedings and have fabricated\\n\\nevidence. See, e.g., In the Matter of Eddings, \\n314 Ga. 409\\n, 417-418 (\\n877\\n\\nSE2d 248\\n) (2022) (disbarring attorney in part because he had made\\n                                   18\\n false statements to a tribunal and in connection with the disciplinary\\n\\nproceeding); In the Matter of Jefferson, \\n307 Ga. 50\\n, 55-56 (\\n834 SE2d\\n\\n73\\n) (2019) (same); Nicholson, 299 at 741 (disbarring attorney who\\n\\nsubmitted a false affidavit to the court); In the Matter of Koehler, \\n297\\n\\nGa. 794\\n, 795-796 (\\n778 SE2d 218\\n) (2015) (disbarring attorney, in part\\n\\nbecause he made materially deceitful and misleading statements in\\n\\nfederal civil action); In the Matter of Minsk, \\n296 Ga. 152\\n, 153 (\\n765 SE2d\\n\\n361\\n) (2014) (disbarring attorney for making knowingly false and\\n\\nmisleading statements to his client, to the court, and to third parties\\n\\nin connection with a bankruptcy case); In the Matter of Jones-Lewis,\\n\\n295 Ga. 861\\n, 862 (\\n764 SE2d 549\\n) (2014) (disbarring attorney, in part\\n\\nbecause she made false statements to the juvenile court); In the Matter\\n\\nof Mann, \\n293 Ga. 664\\n, 665 (\\n748 SE2d 914\\n) (2013) (disbarring attorney,\\n\\nin part because he made a false statement to the court in a contempt\\n\\nhearing); In the Matter of Manning-Wallace, \\n291 Ga. 96\\n, 97 (\\n727 SE2d\\n\\n502\\n) (2012) (disbarring attorney who submitted false evidence to a\\n\\ntribunal, made materially false statements about the evidence to the\\n\\ntribunal, and failed to take any remedial action afterwards); In the\\n\\nMatter of Shehane, \\n276 Ga. 168\\n, 168-169 (\\n575 SE2d 503\\n) (2003)\\n                                   19\\n (disbarring attorney who fabricated evidence submitted to the\\n\\ninvestigative panel to make it appear as though he had handled his\\n\\nclient’s case).\\n\\n      Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the name of Andrea Jo\\n\\nAnne David-Vega be removed from the rolls of persons authorized to\\n\\npractice law in the State of Georgia.

CRARY v. CLAUTICE et al.\\n\\n\\n       COLVIN, Justice.\\n\\n       In this case, the trial court granted Appellant Allison Crary’s\\n\\npetition to set aside and revoke a final consent order, which had\\n\\ngranted grandparent visitation rights under OCGA § 19-7-3 to\\n\\nAppellees Khristel Clautice and Frank Clautice, the maternal\\n\\ngrandparents of Appellant’s minor child. On appeal, Appellant does\\n\\nnot challenge the trial court’s ruling in her favor as to the final\\n\\nconsent order but challenges three other orders from the revocation\\n\\nproceeding: an order denying Appellant’s motion to declare\\n\\nunconstitutional the grandparent visitation statute, OCGA § 19-7-\\n\\n3; an order denying Appellant’s motion for a contempt citation\\n\\nagainst Appellees; and an order denying Appellant’s motion for\\n\\nattorney fees and expenses. As explained below, we dismiss as moot\\n the   portion   of   Appellant’s       appeal   that   challenges   the\\n\\nconstitutionality of the grandparent visitation statute, and we\\n\\naffirm the trial court’s orders denying Appellant’s contempt motion\\n\\nand motion for attorney fees and expenses.\\n\\n      1.   In 2017, Appellant was granted sole legal and physical\\n\\ncustody of her minor child, and the father of Appellant’s minor child\\n\\nwas granted visitation rights. Appellees filed a petition for\\n\\ngrandparent visitation, and, on March 16, 2022, the trial court\\n\\nentered a final consent order (“Grandparent Visitation Order”),\\n\\nwhich permitted Appellees to visit with Appellant’s minor child\\n\\npursuant to an agreed-upon visitation schedule.\\n\\n      On November 16, 2022, Appellant filed a petition asking the\\n\\ntrial court to set aside and revoke the Grandparent Visitation Order,\\n\\nto issue a citation of contempt against Appellees for their failure to\\n\\ncomply with the Grandparent Visitation Order, to declare OCGA\\n\\n§ 19-7-3 facially unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied,\\n\\nand to award Appellant attorney fees and expenses.\\n\\n      Appellant also filed a separate motion to declare the\\n\\n                                   2\\n grandparent visitation statute unconstitutional. Appellant argued\\n\\nthat the grandparent visitation statute was unconstitutional\\n\\nbecause it “fails to provide[,] and Georgia appellate decisions do not\\n\\nset forth[,]” (1) who has the burden of proof when a parent seeks to\\n\\nrevoke a grandparent visitation order, (2) whether proof by clear and\\n\\nconvincing evidence that a child would be harmed absent visitation\\n\\nis required for a grandparent to obtain visitation or for the court to\\n\\ndeny a petition to revoke visitation, (3) whether “good cause” for\\n\\nrevoking grandparent visitation is shown if there is an “absence of a\\n\\nfinding of harm,” and (4) whether courts are prevented from\\n\\ngranting or required to revoke grandparent visitation where the\\n\\nchild lives with both parents. Based on her constitutional\\n\\narguments, Appellant asked the trial court to vacate the\\n\\nGrandparent Visitation Order and “declare OCGA § 19-7-3 facially\\n\\nunconstitutional and [unconstitutional] as applied here.”\\n\\n     After Appellees answered the petition, the trial court held a\\n\\nhearing on Appellant’s petition. The parties made arguments at the\\n\\nhearing but did not present any evidence or testimony.\\n\\n                                  3\\n      On December 5, 2022, the court entered an order summarily\\n\\ndenying      Appellant’s   motion    to     declare   OCGA    §   19-7-3\\n\\nunconstitutional. And on December 12, 2022, the court entered an\\n\\norder that “set aside and vacated” the Grandparent Visitation\\n\\nOrder. In short, the court concluded that “the Grandparent\\n\\nVisitation    Order    contain[ed]       nonamendable   defects   which\\n\\nappear[ed] on the face of the record and the pleadings” because the\\n\\nfather had not been joined as a necessary party under OCGA § 9-11-\\n\\n19 (a) (providing for joinder of indispensable parties), and because\\n\\nthe court had failed to make certain factual findings by clear and\\n\\nconvincing evidence, as required by OCGA § 19-7-3 (c) (1) (providing\\n\\nthat “the court may grant . . . reasonable visitation rights if the court\\n\\n[makes certain findings] by clear and convincing evidence,” and\\n\\nrequiring courts to “make specific written findings of fact in support\\n\\nof its rulings”).\\n\\n     On January 30, 2023, Appellant filed a “Second Motion for an\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     4\\n Award of OCGA § 19-7-3 Attorney’s Fees and Expenses.”1 Appellant\\n\\nargued that attorney fees and expenses were warranted under\\n\\nOCGA § 9-15-14 (a) and (b) because Appellees had defended an\\n\\naction that lacked substantial justification, choosing to file “their\\n\\nobjections and answers” to Appellant’s petition when they instead\\n\\n“should have conceded that the order at issue should be set aside.” 2\\n\\n      On May 31, 2023, the court summarily denied the motion for\\n\\nattorney fees and expenses, stating that it did so “[a]fter careful\\n\\nconsideration of the motion.” The same day, the court issued an\\n\\norder denying Appellant’s motion for a citation of contempt. In that\\n\\norder, the court stated that “[t]he parties and their respective\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 While the record does not contain a “first” motion for attorney fees and\\n\\nexpenses, Appellant’s petition seeking to vacate the Grandparent Visitation\\nOrder sought attorney fees and expenses.\\n        2 OCGA § 9-15-14 provides that, in a civil action, a court can award\\n\\nattorney fees and expenses if a “party has asserted a claim, defense, or other\\nposition with respect to which there existed such a complete absence of any\\njusticiable issue of law or fact that it could not be reasonably believed that a\\ncourt would accept the asserted claim, defense, or other position,” id. § 9-15-14\\n(a), or if the court makes a finding “that an attorney or party brought or\\ndefended an action, or any part thereof, that lacked substantial justification[,]\\nor that the action, or any part thereof, was interposed for delay or harassment,\\nor . . . that an attorney or party unnecessarily expanded the proceeding by\\nother improper conduct,” id. § 9-15-14 (b).\\n                                       5\\n counsel [had] com[e] before the [c]ourt” for a hearing on Appellant’s\\n\\npetition seeking revocation of the Grandparent Visitation Order and\\n\\na citation of contempt, and that, “[a]fter careful consideration of the\\n\\ntestimony and evidence heard at the hearing, this [c]ourt does not\\n\\nfind willful or intentional contempt by the [Appellees].” Appellant\\n\\nthen timely filed a notice of appeal directed to this Court.\\n\\n     2.    On appeal, Appellant first argues that the trial court\\n\\nerred in failing to declare the grandparent visitation statute facially\\n\\nunconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied. In particular,\\n\\nAppellant challenges the constitutionality of the legal standards for\\n\\ngranting visitation rights to a grandparent under OCGA § 19-7-3 (c)\\n\\n(1) and for revoking visitation rights that have previously been\\n\\ngranted to a grandparent under OCGA § 19-7-3 (c) (2).3 According to\\n\\n\\n     3 In relevant part, subsections (1) and (2) of OCGA § 19-7-3 (c) provide:\\n\\n\\n\\n     (1)    Upon the filing of an original action or upon intervention in\\n     an existing proceeding under subsection (b) of this Code section,\\n     the court may grant any family member of the child reasonable\\n     visitation rights if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence\\n     that the health or welfare of the child would be harmed unless such\\n     visitation is granted and if the best interests of the child would be\\n     served by such visitation. . . . In considering whether the health or\\n\\n                                      6\\n Appellant, these legal standards fail to adequately protect parents’\\n\\n“fundamental liberty interests” in “the care, custody, and control of\\n\\ntheir children.” Troxel v. Granville, \\n530 U.S. 57\\n, 65 (II) (120 SCt\\n\\n2054, 147 LE2d 49) (2000).\\n\\n     We    conclude,     however,      that    Appellant’s     constitutional\\n\\nchallenges are moot. “Mootness is an issue of jurisdiction and thus\\n\\nmust be determined before a court addresses the merits of a claim.”\\n\\nIn the Interest of M. F., \\n305 Ga. 820\\n, 820 (\\n828 SE2d 350\\n) (2019)\\n\\n\\n\\n     welfare of the child would be harmed without such visitation, the\\n     court shall consider and may find that harm to the child is\\n     reasonably likely to result when, prior to the original action or\\n     intervention:\\n           (A) The minor child resided with the family member for\\n           six months or more;\\n           (B) The family member provided financial support for the\\n           basic needs of the child for at least one year;\\n           (C) There was an established pattern of regular visitation\\n           or child care by the family member with the child; or\\n           (D) Any other circumstance exists indicating that\\n           emotional or physical harm would be reasonably likely to\\n           result if such visitation is not granted.\\n           The court shall make specific written findings of fact in\\n     support of its rulings.\\n     (2)   . . . . After visitation rights have been granted to any\\n     grandparent, the . . . parent of the child may petition the court for\\n     revocation or amendment of such visitation rights, for good cause\\n     shown, which the court, in its discretion, may grant or deny . . . .\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.)\\n                                      7\\n (citation and punctuation omitted). “When the resolution of a case\\n\\nwould be tantamount to the determination of an abstract question\\n\\nnot arising upon existing facts or rights,” and “[w]hen the remedy\\n\\nsought in litigation no longer benefits the party seeking it, the case\\n\\nis moot and must be dismissed.” McAlister v. Clifton, \\n313 Ga. 737\\n,\\n\\n738 (1) (\\n873 SE2d 178\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, Appellant’s constitutional challenges to the grandparent\\n\\nvisitation statute are moot because a reversal of the trial court’s\\n\\norder   denying     Appellant’s        request   to    declare     the   statute\\n\\nunconstitutional “would have no practical effect on the underlying\\n\\ncontroversy.” Knox v. State, \\n316 Ga. 426\\n, 427-428 (\\n888 SE2d 497\\n)\\n\\n(2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). The trial court already\\n\\nruled in Appellant’s favor when it “set aside and vacated” the\\n\\nGrandparent Visitation Order on other grounds. And we “h[ave] no\\n\\nprovince to determine whether or not [the] statute, in the abstract,\\n\\nis valid.” \\nId.\\n (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Appellant      argues      that     a   declaration      regarding       the\\n\\nconstitutionality    of   the    grandparent          visitation    statute    is\\n\\n                                        8\\n nevertheless authorized here because “she remains in a position of\\n\\nuncertainty with respect to her child and her parents,” “[a]ll\\n\\nparenting decisions and all personal decisions she makes henceforth\\n\\nwill require consideration of the impact, if any, on that ever lurking,\\n\\never threatening grandparent visitation action authorized by OCGA\\n\\n§ 19-7-3,” and she “lives in fear that she may be served with a\\n\\nsummons and petition for grandparent visitation.”\\n\\n     Appellant is correct that “[a] declaratory judgment is\\n\\nauthorized when there are circumstances showing a necessity for a\\n\\ndetermination of the dispute to guide and protect the plaintiff from\\n\\nuncertainty and insecurity with regard to the propriety of some\\n\\nfuture act or conduct, which is properly incident to his alleged rights\\n\\nand which if taken without direction might reasonably jeopardize\\n\\nhis interest.” Baker v. City of Marietta, \\n271 Ga. 210\\n, 214 (1) (\\n518\\n\\nSE2d 879\\n) (1999) (citation and punctuation omitted). But “the relief\\n\\nsought by a plaintiff must have some immediate legal effect on the\\n\\nparties’ conduct, rather than simply burning off an abstract fog of\\n\\nuncertainty,” because “courts may not properly render advisory\\n\\n                                  9\\n opinions.” City of Atlanta v. Atlanta Independent School System, \\n307\\n\\nGa. 877\\n, 880 (\\n838 SE2d 834\\n) (2020). Appellant’s request for\\n\\ndeclaratory relief here does not meet that standard because she\\n\\nasserts only abstract uncertainty over unspecified parenting\\n\\ndecisions and “has not articulated any future conduct upon which\\n\\nthis Court’s resolution” of her constitutional challenges depend. \\nId.\\n\\n\\n     Nor does Appellant’s stated fear of similar litigation in the\\n\\nfuture establish that the constitutional issues she raises avoid\\n\\nmootness on the basis that they are “capable of repetition yet\\n\\nevade[ ] review.” McAlister, 313 Ga. at 740 (1). The fact that\\n\\nAppellees could file a new petition for grandparent visitation or that\\n\\nAppellant might initiate a new revocation proceeding if Appellees\\n\\nare again granted visitation rights does not show that Appellant’s\\n\\nconstitutional challenges would evade review. To the contrary,\\n\\nAppellant, like any parent, could raise her constitutional challenges\\n\\nto the statutory standards for granting or revoking grandparent\\n\\nvisitation in a new action for grandparent visitation, if one is filed,\\n\\nor in a new petition to revoke grandparent visitation, if visitation is\\n\\n                                  10\\n ordered in the future. See id. (“While the question of the\\n\\nconstitutionality of the equitable caregiver statute may well be\\n\\nraised again, there is no reason to believe that it will evade review.\\n\\nAny time a person seeks custody or visitation pursuant to the\\n\\nequitable caregiver statute, the opposing party may challenge the\\n\\nconstitutionality of the statute and the court may consider it . . . .”).\\n\\nAccordingly, we dismiss as moot the portion of Appellant’s appeal\\n\\nchallenging the trial court’s denial of Appellant’s request for a\\n\\ndeclaration    that    the   grandparent      visitation    statute    is\\n\\nunconstitutional.\\n\\n     3.    Next, Appellant challenges the trial court’s denial of her\\n\\nmotion to hold Appellees in contempt. “Trial courts have broad\\n\\ndiscretion in ruling on a motion for contempt, and the trial court’s\\n\\nruling will be affirmed on appeal if there is any evidence in the\\n\\nrecord to support it.” Horn v. Shepherd, \\n292 Ga. 14\\n, 17 (4) (\\n732 SE2d\\n\\n427\\n) (2012) (citation and punctuation omitted). “In order for one to\\n\\nbe held in contempt, there must be a willful disobedience of the\\n\\ncourt’s decree or judgment.” Knott v. Knott, \\n277 Ga. 380\\n, 381 (1) (589\\n\\n                                   11\\nSE2d 99\\n) (2003) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, the trial court ruled that, “[a]fter careful consideration of\\n\\nthe testimony and evidence heard at the hearing, this [c]ourt does\\n\\nnot find willful or intentional contempt by the [Appellees].”\\n\\nAppellant contends that this ruling contains an implicit finding that\\n\\nthe parties presented testimony and evidence at the hearing, and\\n\\nthat this implicit finding was erroneous because no testimony or\\n\\nevidence was presented at the hearing. But even assuming without\\n\\ndeciding that these contentions are correct, they do not establish\\n\\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in denying Appellant’s\\n\\ncontempt motion. As Appellant concedes, no evidence was presented\\n\\nat the hearing to support a contempt finding. And the record does\\n\\nnot indicate that the court prohibited Appellant from introducing\\n\\nevidence in support of her motion. Accordingly, the trial court did\\n\\nnot abuse its discretion in concluding that a contempt citation was\\n\\nunwarranted. See Weaver v. Weaver, \\n242 Ga. 327\\n, 328-329 (3) (\\n249\\n\\nSE2d 36\\n) (1978) (holding that “the judge did not abuse his discretion\\n\\nin refusing to hold the former husband in contempt” where “[t]he\\n\\n                                  12\\n judge did not refuse to hear evidence on the issue of contempt, but\\n\\nnone was offered by either party”). See also Killingsworth v.\\n\\nKillingsworth, \\n286 Ga. 234\\n, 237 (3) (\\n686 SE2d 640\\n) (2009) (holding\\n\\nthat “there was ample evidence in the record to support the court’s\\n\\nfinding that [an ex-wife] did not willfully disobey the provision of the\\n\\ndivorce decree requiring her to leave the marital residence in the\\n\\nsame condition” in part because “[t]here [was] no evidence in the\\n\\nrecord that [she] did anything to damage the marital residence”).\\n\\n     4.    Finally, Appellant argues that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in denying her motion for attorney fees and expenses\\n\\nbecause the court ruled on the motion without holding a hearing and\\n\\ntaking evidence, and because the court considered only Appellant’s\\n\\nmotion, not the entire record, in ruling on the motion. We disagree.\\n\\n     Contrary to Appellant’s argument, the trial court was not\\n\\nrequired to hold a hearing or take evidence before denying the\\n\\nmotion for attorney fees and expenses. As we have explained, “[a]\\n\\nhearing is required in order to enter an award of attorney fees . . . .\\n\\nbecause an oral hearing gives the party opposing attorney fees an\\n\\n                                  13\\n opportunity to confront and challenge testimony with regard to the\\n\\nneed for, and value of, legal services.” Evers v. Evers, \\n277 Ga. 132\\n,\\n\\n132 (1) (\\n587 SE2d 22\\n) (2003) (emphasis supplied). “But this rationale\\n\\ndoes not apply unless attorney fees are to be awarded,” meaning that\\n\\na hearing is not required “[i]f attorney fees are not to be awarded.”\\n\\nId.\\n Here, the trial court was not required to hold a hearing or take\\n\\nevidence before ruling on Appellant’s request for attorney fees and\\n\\nexpenses because the request was denied. See \\nid.\\n\\n\\n     Appellant’s argument that the court failed to consider the\\n\\nentire record in ruling on the motion likewise fails. Appellant\\n\\nappears to argue that the trial court confined its analysis to the four\\n\\ncorners of her motion because the court said it was denying the\\n\\nmotion “[a]fter careful consideration of the motion.” But this\\n\\nstatement indicates only that the court considered the motion, not\\n\\nthat it failed to consider the rest of the record. Moreover, Appellant’s\\n\\nmotion highlighted portions of the record that Appellant believed\\n\\nsupported her motion for attorney fees and expenses. Because the\\n\\ncourt stated that it had carefully considered the motion, it\\n\\n                                  14\\n “presumably took this information . . . into account.” Driver v.\\n\\nDriver, \\n292 Ga. 800\\n, 804-805 (4) (\\n741 SE2d 631\\n) (2013) (noting that\\n\\nwe generally presume that a trial court considered “all the evidence\\n\\npresented”). Accordingly, Appellant has not shown that the trial\\n\\ncourt abused its discretion in denying her motion for attorney fees\\n\\nand expenses.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed in part and appeal dismissed in part.

RUTLEDGE v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      MARKLE, Judge.\\n\\n      Following a jury trial, Ty Rutledge was convicted of simple battery. He appeals\\n\\nfrom the trial court’s denial of his motion for new trial, contending that the trial court\\n\\nerred by denying his motion for immunity under OCGA § 16-3-24.2. Finding no error,\\n\\nwe affirm.\\n\\n      “When reviewing the denial of an immunity motion, an appellate court must\\n\\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s ruling, and accept the\\n\\ntrial court’s findings of fact and credibility determinations if there is any evidence to\\n\\nsupport them.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Jennings v. State, \\n363 Ga. App.\\n\\n170\\n, 176 (2) (\\n869 SE2d 93\\n) (2022).\\n         So viewed, the record shows that Rutledge was charged with simple battery\\n\\nfollowing an altercation with his granddaughter’s boyfriend.1 Rutledge filed a motion\\n\\nfor immunity pursuant to OCGA § 16-3-24.2, claiming he was justified in the use of\\n\\nforce to defend his home under OCGA § 16-3-23 and his property under OCGA § 16-\\n\\n3-24.\\n\\n        The evidence presented at the subsequent pre-trial hearing showed that, at the\\n\\ntime of the incident, Rutledge’s 18-year-old granddaughter, T. R., was living in the\\n\\nhome shared by Rutledge and T. R.’s aunt. T. R. testified that she had told Rutledge\\n\\nand her aunt that she had decided to move in with her uncle, and she began packing.\\n\\nShe invited her boyfriend and another male onto the property to help carry her\\n\\nbelongings to her uncle’s car, which was parked on the road above. She stated that she\\n\\nleft her belongings on the porch or on the grass outside the home, and that she did not\\n\\nsee either man enter the home. As she was handing off a bundle of clothes to her\\n\\nboyfriend; Rutledge came outside and told her boyfriend to get off the property. He\\n\\nthen slapped her boyfriend in the face, at which point, her boyfriend ran back to the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        1\\n            Rutledge was acquitted of a related charge for falsely reporting a crime.\\n                                              2\\n car. T. R. further recounted that her boyfriend had not acted aggressively toward her\\n\\ngrandfather.\\n\\n      The aunt testified that she and Rutledge were startled when they saw two men\\n\\nrapidly approaching the house. She yelled at them to get off the property multiple\\n\\ntimes. She admitted that T. R. had told her and Rutledge she was moving out, and that\\n\\nher friends were helping her. She also testified that the boyfriend had tried to enter the\\n\\nhouse and shoved Rutledge with his shoulder when trying to move past him. She did\\n\\nnot see Rutledge slap the boyfriend, but she had seen the boyfriend run off the\\n\\nproperty, shouting that Rutledge had hit him.\\n\\n      Rutledge did not testify at the hearing. He and the State played\\n\\ncontemporaneous video recordings, but they do not show the altercation at issue.\\n\\n      The trial court denied the motion for immunity, finding that the evidence raised\\n\\na question of fact for the jury.2 A jury ultimately convicted Rutledge of simple battery.3\\n\\n      2\\n         We are not persuaded by Rutledge’s contention that the trial court\\nimpermissibly conflated its duty to determine the issue of immunity with the jury’s\\nduty to determine whether a justification defense is successful. See Pate v. State, \\n364\\nGa. App. 107\\n, 108 (2) (\\n874 SE2d 132\\n) (2022) (Trial courts determine whether a\\ndefendant is entitled to immunity prior to trial; however, a defendant’s justification\\ndefense is left to a jury to decide, and the State bears the burden of disproving the\\ndefense beyond a reasonable doubt.). The transcript reflects that the trial court\\npronounced its decision that immunity was not warranted in this case, and further\\n                                            3\\n He filed a motion for new trial, challenging the trial court’s decision on his immunity\\n\\nmotion. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion, and this appeal\\n\\nfollowed.\\n\\n      In a single enumeration of error, Rutledge claims the trial court erred by\\n\\ndenying his motion for immunity under OCGA §§ 16-3-23; 16-3-23.1; 16-3-24; and 16-\\n\\n3-24.2. Having reviewed the transcripts of the pretrial hearing and the video\\n\\nrecordings, we conclude the trial court did not err.4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninstructed that it would not “prevent [Rutledge] from raising a defense of\\njustification” at trial. As such, the trial court correctly construed the applicable law,\\nand Rutledge mischaracterizes its ruling in his appellate brief.\\n      3\\n        Rutledge renewed his motion for immunity after the close of evidence, and the\\ntrial court again denied it.\\n      4\\n        In his appellate briefs, Rutledge improperly references trial testimony, which\\nwe do not consider in deciding the issue on appeal. See Sifuentes v. State, \\n293 Ga. 441\\n,\\n444 (2), n. 3 (\\n746 SE2d 127\\n) (2013) (reviewing the transcript from the motion hearing,\\nand noting, “the court’s ruling [on a defendant’s immunity motion] must be based\\nsolely on the evidence presented at a pretrial hearing”). However, in reviewing a trial\\ncourt’s denial of a motion for immunity, “we may consider facts that definitively can\\nbe ascertained exclusively by reference to evidence that is uncontradicted and presents\\nno questions of credibility, such as facts indisputably discernible from a\\nvideotape.”(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Allen v. State, \\n317 Ga. 1\\n, 5 (1) (\\n890\\nSE2d 700\\n) (2023). Here, the relevant recordings were consistent with the trial court’s\\nconclusion.\\n                                           4\\n       OCGA § 16-3-23 provides that “[a] person is justified in threatening or using\\n\\nforce against another when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that\\n\\nsuch threat or force is necessary to prevent or terminate such other’s unlawful entry\\n\\ninto . . . a habitation.”5 Similarly, OCGA § 16-3-24 provides, in pertinent part, that\\n\\n“[a] person is justified in threatening or using force against another when and to the\\n\\nextent that he reasonably believes that such threat or force is necessary to prevent or\\n\\nterminate such other’s trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with real\\n\\nproperty other than a habitation” that is lawfully within his or an immediate family\\n\\nmember’s possession. OCGA § 16-3-23.1 provides that a person justified in using\\n\\nforce under certain Code sections, including the two mentioned above, has no duty\\n\\nto retreat, but may stand his ground. And, OCGA § 16-3-24.2 authorizes the immunity\\n\\nfrom prosecution of any person who uses force in accordance with the above three\\n\\nCode sections. A defendant claiming immunity under these statutes bears the burden\\n\\nof proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Pate v. State, \\n364 Ga. App. 107\\n, 108 (2)\\n\\n(\\n874 SE2d 132\\n) (2022).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      5\\n        OCGA § 16-3-24.1 defines “habitation” as “any dwelling, motor vehicle, or\\nplace of business.”\\n                                           5\\n       Rutledge’s arguments center on whether T. R. was authorized to invite her\\n\\nboyfriend onto the property and, thus, whether the boyfriend was trespassing. But,\\n\\neven assuming that the boyfriend was trespassing, Rutledge failed to meet his burden\\n\\nto show he reasonably believed force was necessary to protect his home and property.\\n\\nSee OCGA §§ 16-3-23; 16-3-24. As recounted above, T. R.’s testimony directly\\n\\nconflicted with her aunt’s. And, in denying immunity, the trial court impliedly\\n\\ncredited T. R.’s testimony that her boyfriend was not acting aggressively, but instead\\n\\nhad his hands full with her clothes, when Rutledge struck him. See Blazer v. State, \\n266\\n\\nGa. App. 743\\n, 744, 745 (2) (\\n598 SE2d 338\\n) (2004) (affirming trial court’s denial of an\\n\\nimmunity motion where there was conflicting evidence of a battery, noting: “The\\n\\ndifferences between the two versions are critical.”); Pate, 364 Ga.

Palmer, Katherine E. Fagan, McDonough, for appellant.\\nEdea M. Caldwell, McDonough, for appellee.\\nTHOMPSON, Justice.\\nRaymond and Jessica Turner were married in 1999 and had two children. Raymond filed for divorce in January 2008. The parties reached a partial settlement agreement which provided, inter alia, that husband and wife would share joint legal and physical custody of their two minor children, the custody arrangement being structured so husband is to have physical custody of the children from Friday a.m. until Tuesday a.m., and wife is to have physical custody from Tuesday a.m. through Friday a.m., with exceptions for holidays and other special occasions. Husband also agreed to pay wife $11,000 representing her interest in the marital residence. Left unresolved and submitted to the trial court for determination were issues of child support and the division of extracurricular expenses. The parties waived a hearing, and after an in-chambers conference, the court entered a final judgment and divorce decree which incorporated the partial settlement agreement, ordered husband to pay $552.09 in monthly child support, and apportioned the expenses for the children\\'s extracurricular activities two-thirds to husband and one-third to wife. This Court granted husband\\'s application for discretionary review pursuant to the Family Law Pilot Project.[1]\\n1. The trial court\\'s order includes a finding that husband earned gross monthly income of $5,483.56, approximately 65 percent of the parties\\' combined income. After determining a basic child support obligation of $1,582 for the parties\\' two minor children, the court calculated husband\\'s pro rata share of the basic child support obligation to be $986.75. As evidenced in Schedule E attached to the court\\'s order, however, the court applied a parenting time deviation of $434.66, reducing husband\\'s monthly child support obligation to $552.09. See OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(K). Husband does not on appeal challenge the court\\'s decision to deviate from the presumptive child support obligation. Instead, he contends the trial court erred by failing to explain how the court calculated the deviation and failing to include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children and would not seriously impair his ability to provide for the children. We agree.\\nBecause the trial court\\'s order in this case was entered after July 1, 2008, the revised child support guidelines in OCGA § 19-6-15, including the 2008 amendments thereto, are applicable. See Rumley-Miawama v. Miawama, 284 Ga. 811(1), 671 S.E.2d 827 (2009). The revised guidelines permit the fact-finder to deviate\\nfrom the presumptive amount of child support when special circumstances make the presumptive amount of child support excessive or inadequate due to extended parenting time as set forth in the order of visitation or when the child resides with both parents equally.\\n*598 OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(K)(i). See also OCGA § 19-6-15(b)(8)(J). Where a deviation is determined to apply and the factfinder deviates from the presumptive amount of child support, the order must explain the reasons for the deviation, provide the amount of child support that would have been required if no deviation had been applied, and state how application of the presumptive amount of child support would be unjust or inappropriate and how the best interest of the children for whom support is being determined will be served by the deviation. OCGA § 19-6-15(c)(2)(E) and (i)(1)(B). In addition, the order must include a finding that states how the court\\'s or jury\\'s application of the child support guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate considering the relative ability of each parent to provide support. OCGA § 19-6-15(c)(2)(E)(iii). Because the court in this case applied a discretionary parenting time deviation from the presumptive amount of child support but failed to make all of the findings required under OCGA § 19-6-15(c)(2)(E) and (i)(1)(B), we reverse the trial court\\'s final judgment and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n2. We address husband\\'s challenge to the trial court\\'s apportionment of the expenses of the children\\'s extracurricular activities because that issue is likely to recur on remand. The trial court\\'s order requires husband to pay two-thirds of the children\\'s extracurricular activities. Husband contends he is paying twice for the cost of extracurricular activities because such costs are included in the presumptive amount of child support. See OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(J)(ii).\\nThe language of OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(J)(ii) makes clear that a portion of the basic child support obligation is intended to cover average amounts of special expenses for raising children, including the cost of extracurricular activities. If a factfinder determines that the full amount of special expenses described in that division exceeds seven percent of the basic child support obligation, the \"additional amount of special expenses shall be considered as a deviation to cover the full amount of the special expenses.\" Id. Such a deviation must then be included in Schedule E of the Child Support Worksheet and, as with other deviations from the presumptive amount of child support, the factfinder must make the required written findings. See OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(1)(B).\\nThe trial court here made no provision in its Schedule E for a deviation for special expenses. Instead, the court included a provision in the final judgment apportioning among the parties the entire cost of the children\\'s extracurricular expenses using essentially the same ratio as applied to the basic child support obligation. This a court is no longer entitled to do. Under the revised guidelines, a court may only deviate from the presumptive child support amount based on special expenses incurred for child-rearing, including extracurricular expenses, by complying with OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(J)(ii) (defining \"special expenses\" as certain child-rearing expenses exceeding seven percent of basic child support obligation) and OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(1)(B) (requiring written findings for all deviations). Thus, while the court was free to reject husband\\'s claim for a deviation from the presumptive child support amount based on the cost of the children\\'s extracurricular activities, see Johnson v. Johnson, 284 Ga. 366, 367(1), 667 S.E.2d 350 (2008), it was without authority to make a separate child support award, one outside the parameters of the Child Support Worksheet, based on the cost of such activities.\\nJudgment reversed and case remanded.\\nAll the Justices concur.\\nNOTES\\n[1] Pursuant to the Family Law Pilot Project, this Court grants all non-frivolous applications seeking review of a judgment and decree of divorce.

FEDER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       BETHEL, Justice.\\n\\n       Visheslav Feder was convicted of felony murder and other\\n\\ncrimes in connection with the shooting death of Avery Birthrong.1\\n\\nOn appeal, Feder contends that his acquittal for the aggravated\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 The crimes occurred on July 17, 2018. On October 24, 2018, a Gwinnett\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Feder for felony murder predicated on the\\naggravated assault of Avery Birthrong (Count 1); aggravated assault of\\nBirthrong (Count 2); aggravated assault of Laurence Parks (Count 3);\\naggravated assault of John Durden (Count 4); and possession of a firearm\\nduring the commission of a felony (Count 5). Following a trial held from\\nJanuary 31 to February 7, 2022, the jury found Feder not guilty of the\\naggravated assault of Parks (Count 3), but guilty of felony murder (Count 1)\\nand the remaining counts (Counts 2, 4-5). The trial court sentenced Feder to\\nserve life in prison without the possibility of parole on Count 1, twenty years\\nin prison on Count 4 to be served consecutively to Count 1, and five years in\\nprison on Count 5 to be served consecutively to Count 1; Count 2 merged into\\nCount 1.\\n      Feder filed a timely motion for new trial, which was later amended\\nthrough new counsel. Following a hearing on June 28, 2023, the trial court\\ndenied the amended motion on November 7, 2023. Feder then filed a timely\\nnotice of appeal, and his case was docketed to the April 2024 term of this Court\\nand submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n assault of Laurence Parks means that he should not have been\\n\\nconvicted for the felony murder and aggravated assault of Birthrong\\n\\nor the aggravated assault of John Durden because the verdicts are\\n\\nrepugnant. Feder also argues that his trial counsel rendered\\n\\nineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress evidence\\n\\nrecovered during a search of Feder’s cell phone. However, the\\n\\nverdicts were not illogical and were, at most, inconsistent rather\\n\\nthan repugnant, which is not a basis for reversal. And the ineffective\\n\\nassistance claim fails because Feder has failed to establish that his\\n\\ntrial counsel’s decision not to file a motion to suppress was deficient.\\n\\nAccordingly, we affirm.\\n\\n     1. The evidence presented at trial showed the following. In\\n\\nJune 2018, Avery Birthrong borrowed between sixty and seventy\\n\\ndollars from Feder to bail her boyfriend, Laurence Parks, out of jail.\\n\\nBirthrong offered to repay Feder in small increments, but he\\n\\nrefused, stating that he wanted the money back all at once. When\\n\\nBirthrong and Parks were unable to repay the entire amount, Feder\\n\\nbegan threatening them and making threats about them to others.\\n\\n                                   2\\n Feder told Erica Lenity, a mutual friend, that he “would kill [Parks\\n\\nand Birthrong].” Lenity testified that Parks “swore on his kid’s life\\n\\nthat he would pay [Feder] back,” and that Feder told Lenity, “I can’t\\n\\nfind his kid but I can find him.” Feder also tried to have Lenity “set\\n\\nup” Parks and Birthrong by inviting them to her house where Feder\\n\\nwould then confront them, but Lenity refused and instead warned\\n\\nBirthrong and Parks. Additionally, Feder sent Margaret Caldwell,\\n\\nhis girlfriend at the time, emails while she was incarcerated, stating,\\n\\n“[W]e need to talk about your friends. They are going to make me\\n\\nintroduce them to another me they don’t know about.” In a recorded\\n\\nphone call between Caldwell and Feder, Feder said, “I’m going to\\n\\nf***ing beat the s**t out of [Parks,] and I’m more likely going to stab.\\n\\n. . [Birthrong].” Feder continued sending threatening text messages\\n\\nto Birthrong and Parks, and Parks used Birthrong’s phone to\\n\\nrespond.\\n\\n      Meanwhile, Feder learned from Jeanara Bandy that Birthrong\\n\\nhad    contacted     her    friend,       John   Durden,   to    obtain\\n\\nmethamphetamine, and that Durden was with Parks and Birthrong.\\n\\n                                      3\\n Feder remarked that he had just bonded Parks out of jail and that\\n\\nParks was trying to buy drugs instead of paying him back the money\\n\\nhe owed. Feder and Bandy then began driving toward Durden’s\\n\\nhome. Feder texted Parks, “Just don’t run brah okay,” and, “[H]ere\\n\\nI come.”\\n\\n     Meanwhile, Parks and Birthrong picked up Durden from his\\n\\nhome. About one mile from Durden’s home, when they were stopped\\n\\nat a red light at an intersection, Durden and Parks heard “peeling\\n\\ntires,” and Parks saw Feder’s truck run a red light and make a “crazy\\n\\nu-turn” in their direction. Inside his truck, Feder exclaimed to\\n\\nBandy, “that’s the mother f***er right there” before turning around\\n\\nto follow the vehicle containing Birthrong, Parks, and Durden.\\n\\nWhen Feder’s truck pulled alongside the vehicle, Parks saw Feder\\n\\npointing a gun at him. Parks responded by drawing Birthrong’s gun\\n\\nfrom beneath the seat and pointing it at Feder. Feder and Parks\\n\\nexchanged words, and then Parks fired one shot at Feder and\\n\\nimmediately turned right because he “wasn’t going to wait to see if\\n\\n[Feder] was going to shoot [him] or not[.]”Parks did not hear any\\n\\n                                 4\\n return fire until “maybe like five, ten seconds” after making the right\\n\\nturn. On cross-examination, Parks emphasized that Feder “didn’t\\n\\nshoot before [Parks] turned” and that he did not hear shots fired by\\n\\nFeder until after he “had already made the right.” Although Durden\\n\\nsaw only the initial gunshot at the intersection because he ducked\\n\\ndown in his seat, he heard the shooter say, “I got you now,” and then\\n\\nheard three to five additional gunshots. Shortly after fleeing the\\n\\nintersection,2 Durden noticed that Birthrong had been shot. Feder\\n\\nsubsequently texted Parks, “Found your b***h a*s.” Parks\\n\\nresponded, “You killed [A]very.” Birthrong died as a result of a\\n\\ngunshot wound to the left side of her head, which a crime scene\\n\\nspecialist determined to have been fired from outside the vehicle.\\n\\n     After the shooting, Feder drove away from the scene and threw\\n\\nhis firearm out of the vehicle’s window. Bandy testified that, after\\n\\nthis and, “not long after the incident,” Feder got into a different\\n\\nvehicle.\\n\\n\\n     2 The events at the intersection were captured on surveillance footage\\n\\nfrom a nearby convenience store, which was shown to the jury; the footage\\nshowed Feder’s vehicle pull alongside Parks’ vehicle before Parks sped off.\\n                                    5\\n      After learning from Parks and Durden that Feder had been\\n\\ninvolved in the shooting, the police obtained Birthrong’s cell phone\\n\\nbecause Parks told them that he used it to communicate with Feder.\\n\\nInvestigators also obtained Birthrong’s phone records and were able\\n\\nto review text messages between Birthrong’s phone and Feder’s\\n\\nphone.\\n\\n     Feder was arrested in Arkansas, and two cell phones were\\n\\nseized from his vehicle. The text messages sent from Feder’s phone\\n\\nto Birthrong’s phone were introduced at trial. Feder argued at trial\\n\\nthat he was justified in shooting at the vehicle because he only did\\n\\nso after he was fired upon first.\\n\\n     2. In his first enumeration of error, Feder argues that he is\\n\\nentitled to a new trial because the jury’s verdicts were repugnant.\\n\\nAs noted in footnote 1, supra, Feder was charged with three counts\\n\\nof aggravated assault based on firing his weapon at Birthrong\\n\\n(Count 2), Parks (Count 3), and Durden (Count 4), who were all\\n\\npassengers in the same vehicle at the time Feder fired at the vehicle.\\n\\nThe jury found Feder not guilty of the aggravated assault of Parks,\\n\\n                                    6\\n but guilty of the aggravated assaults of Birthrong and Durden. On\\n\\nappeal, Feder contends that because the jury found him not guilty\\n\\nof the aggravated assault of Parks (Count 3), the jury must have\\n\\nfound that he did not fire his weapon at the vehicle in which all three\\n\\nvictims were passengers.3 He argues that because the jury made this\\n\\nfinding, the jury could not logically or legally find him guilty of the\\n\\nfelony murder of Birthrong (Count 1) or the aggravated assault of\\n\\nDurden (Count 4) because those counts were premised on Feder’s\\n\\nfiring his weapon at the vehicle in the same transaction. We\\n\\ndisagree.\\n\\n     “Repugnant verdicts occur when, in order to find the defendant\\n\\nnot guilty on one count and guilty on another, the jury must make\\n\\naffirmative findings shown on the record that cannot logically or\\n\\nlegally exist at the same time.” State v. Owens, 312 Ga. 212, 216 (1)\\n\\n(b) (862 SE2d 125) (2021) (cleaned up). When verdicts are\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 In his brief, Feder incorrectly identifies Count 3 as charging the\\naggravated assault of Durden. Our review of the record shows that Count 3\\ncharged Feder with the aggravated assault of Parks, not Durden.\\n                                   7\\n repugnant, they must be vacated.4 See id. By contrast, “inconsistent\\n\\nverdicts occur when a jury in a criminal case renders seemingly\\n\\nincompatible verdicts of guilty on one charge and not guilty on\\n\\nanother.” McElrath v. State, 308 Ga. 104, 108 (2) (a) (839 SE2d 573)\\n\\n(2020) (emphasis in original). “We have abolished the rule that\\n\\ninconsistent verdicts require reversal.” Id. “Inconsistent verdicts are\\n\\npermitted to stand because the jury’s rationale is not apparent from\\n\\nthe record and courts generally are not permitted to make inquiries\\n\\ninto the jury’s deliberation process.” Owens, 312 Ga. at 216-217 (1)\\n\\n(b).\\n\\n       Here, the verdicts are at most inconsistent, as the record does\\n\\nnot reflect any affirmative finding by the jury that Feder did not fire\\n\\nhis weapon at the vehicle containing Durden, Parks, and Birthrong.\\n\\nCompare Guajardo v. State, 290 Ga. 172, 174 (2) (718 SE2d 292)\\n\\n\\n\\n       4 We question the continuing validity of our repugnant verdict caselaw\\n\\nin the wake of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in McElrath v.\\nGeorgia, 601 U. S. 87, 95-96 (144 SCt 651, 217 LE2d 419) (2024). However, we\\nneed not decide that issue here, as these verdicts are not repugnant and the\\nparties did not raise the ongoing validity of our repugnant verdict case law.\\nSee Ward v. State, No. S24A0352, 2024 LEXIS 100, 2024 WL 1862343, at *9\\n(2) n.12.\\n                                      8\\n (2011) (repugnant verdicts require reversal “in the rare instance\\n\\nwhere, instead of being left to speculate as to the jury’s\\n\\ndeliberations, the appellate record makes transparent the jury’s\\n\\nrationale”). In the absence of such an affirmative finding,\\n\\ndetermining the precise basis for the jury’s not guilty verdict on\\n\\nCount 3 “would be based either on pure speculation, or would require\\n\\ninquiries into the jury’s deliberation that the courts generally will\\n\\nnot undertake.” Carter v. State, 298 Ga. 867, 868-869 (785 SE2d 274)\\n\\n(2016) (citation and punctuation omitted). We “cannot know and\\n\\nshould not speculate why a jury acquitted on one offense and\\n\\nconvicted on another offense. The reason could be an error by the\\n\\njury in its consideration or it could be mistake, compromise, or\\n\\nlenity.” Turner v. State, 283 Ga. 17, 20 (2) (655 SE2d 589) (2008)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). Accordingly, Feder’s claim fails.\\n\\n     2. Feder next argues that trial counsel provided ineffective\\n\\nassistance by failing to file a motion to suppress evidence recovered\\n\\nduring a search of the cell phones found in his vehicle. More\\n\\nspecifically, Feder argues that trial counsel should have moved to\\n\\n                                 9\\n suppress his cell phone records because his phone was seized\\n\\nwithout a warrant, without his consent, and without exigent\\n\\ncircumstances. He also asserts that the later-obtained search\\n\\nwarrant was overbroad and not particularized to the items to be\\n\\nseized from the phones. Feder argues that, had trial counsel filed\\n\\nthe motion, “damaging evidence” would have been suppressed,\\n\\nthough Feder does not specify what that evidence was.\\n\\n     To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance, Feder\\n\\n     has the burden of proving both that the performance of\\n     his lawyer was professionally deficient and that he was\\n     prejudiced as a result. To prove deficient performance, [an\\n     appellant] must show that his trial counsel acted or failed\\n     to act in an objectively reasonable way, considering all of\\n     the circumstances and in light of prevailing professional\\n     norms. To prove resulting prejudice, [an appellant] must\\n     show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\\n     deficiency, the result of the trial would have been\\n     different. In examining an ineffectiveness claim, a court\\n     need not address both components of the inquiry if the\\n     defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\\n\\nFloyd v. State, 307 Ga. 789, 799 (4) (837 SE2d 790) (2020) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). “When trial counsel’s failure to file a\\n\\nmotion to suppress is the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance,\\n\\n                                 10\\n the defendant must make a strong showing that the damaging\\n\\nevidence would have been suppressed had counsel made the\\n\\nmotion.” Santana v. State, 308 Ga. 706, 712 (3) (a) (842 SE2d 14)\\n\\n(2020).\\n\\n     In evaluating whether trial counsel’s performance was\\n\\ndeficient, “our inquiry is focused on the objective reasonableness of\\n\\ncounsel’s performance, not counsel’s subjective state of mind.” Davis\\n\\nv. State, 306 Ga. 140, 143 (3) (829 SE2d 321) (2019) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). When evaluating counsel’s reasonableness,\\n\\nwe consider “the attendant circumstances of the challenged conduct”\\n\\nand judge “from counsel’s perspective at the time with every effort\\n\\nmade to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.” Id. at 144 (3)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     The law recognizes a strong presumption that counsel\\n     performed reasonably, and the defendant bears the\\n     burden of overcoming this presumption. To carry this\\n     burden, [an appellant] must show that no reasonable\\n     lawyer would have done what his lawyer did, or would\\n     have failed to do what his lawyer did not.\\n\\nEvans v. State, 315 Ga. 607, 611 (2) (b) (884 SE2d 334) (2023)\\n\\n\\n                                 11\\n (citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Based on the record before us, Feder has failed to prove that\\n\\ntrial counsel’s performance was deficient. The record makes clear\\n\\nthat trial counsel made the strategic decision not to move to\\n\\nsuppress the cell phone records. Though Feder does not detail what\\n\\n“damaging” evidence in these records should have been suppressed,\\n\\ntrial counsel testified at the hearing on the motion for new trial that,\\n\\n“to the extent there was anything harmful on the phones,” that same\\n\\nevidence was also recovered from Birthrong’s phone, so filing a\\n\\nmotion to suppress “wouldn’t have made any difference.” In fact,\\n\\ninvestigators were able to obtain Birthrong’s phone records through\\n\\na separate search warrant and review the text exchanges between\\n\\nFeder, Birthrong, and Parks, even before they applied for a search\\n\\nwarrant for Feder’s phone. Although these records were not\\n\\nadmitted into evidence at trial, they showed the same text\\n\\nexchanges, which an investigator testified was “verbatim,” between\\n\\nthe parties as that which was admitted into evidence from Feder’s\\n\\nphone records. Accordingly, even if Feder had succeeded on a motion\\n\\n                                  12\\n to suppress his cell phone records, the State easily could have\\n\\nremedied the problem by moving to admit into evidence Birthrong’s\\n\\ncell phone records. Therefore, it was reasonable for trial counsel not\\n\\nto raise a motion to suppress. See Washington v. State, 313 Ga. 771,\\n\\n774 (3) (b) (873 SE2d 132) (2022) (appellant failed to show that\\n\\ncounsel performed deficiently by failing to object to evidence on\\n\\nfoundation grounds where appellant failed to argue, much less\\n\\ndemonstrate, that the State could not have provided additional\\n\\nfoundational support for the admission of the evidence if his counsel\\n\\nhad objected). Moreover, Feder has not established that he would\\n\\nhave had standing to challenge the admissibility of the identical\\n\\nrecords from Birthrong’s phone, nor does he make any other\\n\\nargument as to why those records would not have been admissible.\\n\\nSee Davis, 301 Ga. at 406 (6) (c) (holding that defendant lacked\\n\\nstanding to challenge admission of cell phone records obtained from\\n\\nservice provider where the defendant “provided no evidence that he\\n\\nhad any legal link to the account, much less any ownership interest\\n\\nin it; nor has he shown that he was an authorized user on the\\n\\n                                 13\\n account, or the de facto exclusive, primary, or customary user of the\\n\\ncell number of issue” (citation and punctuation omitted)); Hampton\\n\\nv. State, 295 Ga. 665, 669-670 (2) (763 SE2d 467) (2014) (same). See\\n\\nalso Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 130 (1) n.1 (99 SCt 421, 58 SE2d\\n\\n387) (1978) (“The proponent of a motion to suppress has the burden\\n\\nof establishing that his own Fourth Amendment rights were violated\\n\\nby the challenged search or seizure.”). And Feder does not specify\\n\\nwhat other “damaging evidence,” if any, was collected from the\\n\\nsearch of his phone and admitted against him at trial.\\n\\n     Feder’s trial counsel also conceded that some of the text\\n\\nmessages were, instead, advantageous to Feder’s self-defense claim\\n\\nbecause they showed Parks’s “challenging statements” to Feder and\\n\\n“history of hostility” toward Feder. Feder’s counsel argued at trial\\n\\nthat Feder was acting in self-defense after Parks shot at him and\\n\\nthat Parks had “talked trash back and forth” and had “bad\\n\\nintentions.” It was not objectively unreasonable for counsel to\\n\\nhighlight the ways in which the text messages supported Feder’s\\n\\njustification defense, rather than move to suppress them.\\n\\n                                  14\\n      Because the decision not to seek a motion to suppress was not\\n\\nobjectively unreasonable under the circumstances, it cannot form\\n\\nthe basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Thomas\\n\\nv. State, 311 Ga. 280, 286 (2) (857 SE2d 223) (2021) (identifying no\\n\\ndeficient performance where counsel chose to withdraw a motion to\\n\\nsuppress and to “vigorously pursue a self-defense theory at trial and\\n\\nto characterize any evidence at her disposal in any way that could\\n\\nadvance that theory”); Reyes v. State, 309 Ga. 660, 671 (3) (a) (847\\n\\nSE2d 194) (2020) (identifying no deficient performance where\\n\\ncounsel could reasonably determine that the best defense strategy\\n\\nwas to forgo a motion to suppress DNA evidence and offer a plausible\\n\\nexplanation for its presence at the crime scene). Thus, Feder’s final\\n\\nclaim fails.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

HALL v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      MERCIER, Chief Judge.\\n\\n      Following a jury trial, Vincent Ivory Hall appeals his convictions for aggravated\\n\\nassault, burglary, theft by taking, possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony, and battery, contending that the evidence was insufficient to support a number\\n\\nof his convictions and that the trial court erred by admitting certain evidence under\\n\\nthe residual exception to the rule against hearsay.1 For the reasons set forth below, we\\n\\naffirm.\\n\\n\\n      1\\n        Hall was indicted for malice murder, two counts of felony murder, three\\ncounts of aggravated assault, burglary, theft by taking, two counts of possession of a\\nfirearm during the commission of a felony, and battery. The jury acquitted Hall of\\nmalice murder and deadlocked on the two counts of felony murder and one count of\\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Hall was found guilty and convicted of the\\nremaining charges.\\n       It is well settled that,\\n\\n      [w]hen evaluating the sufficiency of evidence, the proper standard for\\n      review is whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant\\n      guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n (99\\n      SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). [An appellate court] does not reweigh\\n      evidence or resolve conflicts in testimony; instead, evidence is reviewed\\n      in a light most favorable to the verdict, with deference to the jury’s\\n      assessment of the weight and credibility of the evidence.\\n\\nHarper v. State, \\n298 Ga. 158\\n, 158 (\\n780 SE2d 308\\n) (2015) (citations omitted).\\n\\n      Viewed in this light, the evidence presented at trial indicates that Hall had been\\n\\nin a romantic relationship with both Leandra Ashby and Skyla Hunt for several years,\\n\\nalthough Ashby did not know about Hall’s intimate relationship with Hunt. On April\\n\\n20, 2016, Ashby discovered an Instagram photo of Hunt and Hall together and\\n\\ndecided to message Hunt. In the ensuing text conversation, Ashby learned of Hunt’s\\n\\nrelationship with Hall. Hunt also revealed to Ashby that, earlier that same day, Hall\\n\\nhit her in the head with a .45 caliber Glock handgun belonging to Hunt, put the gun\\n\\nagainst her head, and stated that he hoped she died.2 After learning of Hall’s\\n\\nrelationship with Hunt, Ashby confronted Hall, broke up with him, and began\\n\\nrepeatedly asking Hall to return her house key. Hall did not comply.\\n\\n      2\\n        Additional text messages from Hall to Hunt corroborated that the two had a\\nfight and that Hall told Hunt that he hoped that she died.\\n                                           2\\n        After further conversations, Ashby and Hunt decided to meet in person, and\\n\\nthey attended a party together on the night of April 23, 2016. While out, Ashby sent\\n\\nHall a photo of herself and Hunt, and both women talked with Hall on the phone.\\n\\nAshby asked Hall to return her house key, and Hunt requested the return of her .45\\n\\ncaliber Glock handgun, which Hall had taken. At 10:20 pm, Hall texted Hunt, “Come\\n\\nget your gun and tell [Ashby] to come get her keys,” and around 11:30 PM, he texted\\n\\nHunt, “[C]ome to me . . . now.” In response, Hunt told Hall that she and Ashby\\n\\nwould stop by his home following the party. At some point after midnight, the women\\n\\ntraveled to Hall’s home to retrieve Ashby’s key and Hunt’s gun, but Hall was not\\n\\nthere. The women then decided to go back to Ashby’s home, where Hunt had left her\\n\\ncar.\\n\\n       Unbeknownst to the women, Hall had stolen someone else’s car earlier that\\n\\nnight and driven it to Ashby’s house,3 though he did not park in Ashby’s driveway or\\n\\ncarport, where he normally parked. Armed with Hunt’s Glock, Hall entered Ashby’s\\n\\nhouse, went into a storage closet, and waited. Before arriving home, Ashby told Hunt\\n\\nshe was “scared” that Hall might show up at any moment because he still had her key.\\n\\n       3\\n        The jury found Hall guilty of theft by taking for this act, and Hall does not\\nchallenge this particular verdict on appeal.\\n                                          3\\n As the women entered the house, Ashby heard her storage closet door open, and Hall\\n\\nsuddenly emerged, pointing the Glock at the women and yelling, “So this is what y’all\\n\\nwanted[?]” As Hall approached Ashby with the Glock, she “flail[ed]” her arms and\\n\\ntried to get away from him. Hall then hit Ashby in the head with the gun, at which\\n\\ntime Hunt intervened by pulling a .9 mm pistol from her purse and warning Hall not\\n\\nto touch Ashby.\\n\\n      Next, Hall snatched the .9 mm gun out of Hunt’s hand, fought with her, and\\n\\nslammed her head against a wall. After a momentary break in the fighting, Ashby\\n\\ncommanded both Hall and Hunt to leave her home, and they complied. Hunt,\\n\\nhowever, forgot her purse inside the home, and Ashby allowed her to re-enter. Hall\\n\\neventually followed, and he and Hunt began to fight again. During the following\\n\\naltercation, Hall continued to hold both guns, and the .9 mm fired, fatally shooting\\n\\nHunt in the chest. Hall fled, but subsequently turned himself into police.\\n\\n      While in custody and waiting for trial, Hall communicated with Ashby, though\\n\\nhe attempted to conceal it.4 In one letter to Ashby, Hall included a transcript of\\n\\nAshby’s statement to police immediately following the shooting and instructed her to\\n\\n      4\\n       For example, Hall addressed the letters to Ashby’s address, but he addressed\\nthem as being from “Travis Nelson” to “Crystal Waters.”\\n                                          4\\n explain any conflict between her favorable testimony at trial and her prior police\\n\\ninterview by saying she was “afraid and angry” when she talked with the police. And,\\n\\nat trial, Ashby did, in fact, take issue with many aspects of her statement to police\\n\\nimmediately after the shooting by testifying that she was “traumatized” at the time.\\n\\n      Based on this evidence, the jury found Hall guilty of the aggravated assault of\\n\\nAshby, burglary, theft by taking, possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony for each handgun, and the battery of Ashby.5 The jury found Hall not guilty of\\n\\nthe murder of Hunt, and it deadlocked on the charges of felony murder and the\\n\\naggravated assault of Hunt. Following the denial of a motion for new trial, Hall\\n\\ninitiated the present appeal.\\n\\n      1. (a) Hall argues that, based on Ashby’s testimony at trial, the evidence was\\n\\ninsufficient to support his conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon\\n\\nupon Ashby.6 He is incorrect.7\\n\\n\\n      5\\n         Hall raises no sufficiency challenge to his convictions for the aggravated\\nassault of Hunt (Count 6), the battery of Ashby (Count 11), and the theft by taking of\\na Jeep (Count 8), and we do not consider them.\\n      6\\n       OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (a person commits assault when he “[a]ttempts to\\ncommit a violent injury to the person of another” or “[c]ommits an act which places\\nanother in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury”);\\nOCGA § 16-5-21 (a) (2) (a person commits aggravated assault when he commits an\\n                                          5\\n       In Count 5, Hall was indicted for committing aggravated assault “by aiming a\\n\\ndeadly weapon, to wit: a handgun at, toward, and in her direction, thereby placing . .\\n\\n. Ashby in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving serious bodily injury[.]”\\n\\nAnd, in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence showed that Hall\\n\\nunexpectedly emerged from a storage closet pointing a handgun and yelling at Ashby\\n\\nand Hunt, thereby causing Ashby to flail her arms and attempt to get away. This\\n\\nevidence is sufficient to support Hall’s conviction. See Howard v. State, \\n288 Ga. 741\\n,\\n\\n742 (1) (\\n707 SE2d 80\\n) (2011) (“Testimony that the victims ran from the gunfire is\\n\\nsufficient evidence that [they were placed] in reasonable apprehension of immediately\\n\\nreceiving a violent injury.”). Hall’s reliance on Ashby’s testimony at trial that was\\n\\nfavorable to him does not change this result. Much of Ashby’s testimony at trial\\n\\ndirectly contradicted her previous statement to police given immediately following the\\n\\nshooting, and the jury was authorized to credit Ashby’s prior statement over her\\n\\ninconsistent testimony at trial. See Horne v. State, \\n333 Ga. App. 353\\n, 357 (1) (b) (773\\n\\n\\n\\nassault “[w]ith a deadly weapon”) (2016).\\n      7\\n        We note that, although Hall’s brief contains cites to the record and transcripts,\\nit does not properly cite to the volume and page of the appellate record as required by\\nour Rules. See Court of Appeals Rule 25 (d) (2).\\n                                           6\\nSE2d 467\\n) (2015) (“The jury is the arbiter of credibility, and it was able to assess all\\n\\nof the evidence and determine whether the victim’s recantation was credible.”).\\n\\n      (b) Hall also contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his\\n\\nconviction for burglary.8 Again, he is incorrect.\\n\\n      The indictment alleged that Hall committed burglary by entering Ashby’s home\\n\\n“without authority and with the intent to commit . . . Aggravated Assault with a\\n\\nDeadly Weapon therein[.]” In the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence\\n\\nshows that, after Ashby had broken up with Hall and had repeatedly asked for the\\n\\nreturn of her key, Hall let himself into Ashby’s home without permission (which\\n\\nAshby had been scared he might do), waited in a closet for Ashby and Hall to return,\\n\\nand angrily confronted the women with Hunt’s Glock moments after the women\\n\\nentered the home. This evidence is sufficient to support the verdict. See Hewatt v.\\n\\nState, \\n216 Ga. App. 550\\n, 551 (2) (\\n455 SE2d 104\\n) (1995) (finding that intent may be\\n\\ninferred from circumstantial evidence).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      8\\n        See OCGA § 16-7-1 (B) (“A person commits the offense of burglary in the first\\ndegree when, without authority and with the intent to commit a felony or theft\\ntherein, he or she enters or remains within an occupied, unoccupied, or vacant\\ndwelling house of another[.]).\\n                                           7\\n       (c) Hall further maintains that the evidence was insufficient to support his two\\n\\nconvictions for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (one count\\n\\nfor each handgun).9 We disagree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      9\\n          OCGA § 16-11-106 provides:\\n\\n      (b) Any person who shall have on or within arm’s reach of his or her\\n      person a firearm or a knife having a blade of three or more inches in\\n      length during the commission of, or the attempt to commit:\\n\\n      (1) Any crime against or involving the person of another;\\n\\n      (2) The unlawful entry into a building or vehicle;\\n\\n      (3) A theft from a building or theft of a vehicle;\\n\\n      (4) Any crime involving the possession, manufacture, delivery,\\n      distribution, dispensing, administering, selling, or possession with intent\\n      to distribute any controlled substance or marijuana as provided in Code\\n      Section 16-13-30, any counterfeit substance as defined in Code Section\\n      16-13-21, or any noncontrolled substance as provided in Code Section\\n      16-13-30.1; or\\n\\n      (5) Any crime involving the trafficking of cocaine, marijuana, or illegal\\n      drugs as provided in Code Section 16-13-31,\\n\\n      and which crime is a felony, commits a felony and, upon conviction\\n      thereof, shall be punished by confinement for a period of five years, such\\n      sentence to run consecutively to any other sentence which the person\\n      has received.\\n                                          8\\n       In Count 9 of the indictment, Hall was charged with possession of a firearm\\n\\nduring the commission of a felony because he “did unlawfully have on and within\\n\\narm’s reach of accused’s person a [.]9 millimeter caliber handgun during the\\n\\ncommission of at least one of the following felonies: Murder, Felony Murder,\\n\\nAggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon, and Burglary in the First Degree.” In\\n\\nCount 10, he was indicted for possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony for possession of the .45 caliber Glock handgun in an identical manner. In\\n\\nconsidering both of these indicted charges for sufficiency, it is important to note that\\n\\nthe jury’s verdict gives no indication as to which predicate felony or felonies it\\n\\nconsidered when finding Hall guilty of each possession count. Therefore, sufficiency\\n\\nof any of the alleged underlying felonies might support the verdict.\\n\\n      With regard to both counts of possession of a firearm, Hall first contends that\\n\\nneither could be premised on the underlying felonies of aggravated assault with a\\n\\ndeadly weapon of Ashby or burglary, reiterating his previous argument that the\\n\\nevidence was insufficient to support a conviction for either of these predicate crimes.\\n\\nAs discussed directly above, Hall’s insufficiency argument with regard to these\\n\\npredicate counts is misplaced. This, in turn, allows quick resolution of Hall’s\\n\\n\\n                                           9\\n sufficiency challenge to Count 10, as the evidence plainly indicates that Hall was in\\n\\npossession of the .45 caliber Glock handgun at the time that he committed both\\n\\nburglary and the aggravated assault of Ashby.\\n\\n      Consideration of Count 9, possession of the .9 mm handgun, is slightly more\\n\\ncomplicated, however, because Hall did not take possession of that weapon until after\\n\\nhis confrontation with Ashby and Hunt was underway. Even if we assume without\\n\\ndeciding that, based on the wording of the indictment, burglary and the aggravated\\n\\nassault of Ashby could not be predicate felonies because Hall did not have the .9 mm\\n\\nhandgun until he snatched it from Hunt after she tried to defend Ashby, we must still\\n\\nconsider the remaining predicate felonies. Those remaining predicates include Count\\n\\n1, the murder of Hunt “by shooting her with a handgun;” Count 2, the felony murder\\n\\nof Hunt committed by shooting her during the commission of an aggravated assault\\n\\nagainst her with a deadly weapon; Count 3, the felony murder of Hunt committed by\\n\\nshooting her with a handgun during the commission of burglary; and Count 4,\\n\\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon committed by “shooting [Hunt] with a\\n\\nhandgun, the same being a deadly weapon[.]”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         10\\n       With regard to these possible predicates, the jury found Hall not guilty of\\n\\nmurder, and it deadlocked on Counts 2, 3, and 4. Hunt argues that none of these\\n\\ncounts may serve as a predicate for Count 9 because he was not ultimately convicted\\n\\nfor any of them. That is not correct, as “[i]t is well-settled . . . that there is no\\n\\nprohibition against inconsistent verdicts. Smith v. State, \\n348 Ga. App. 643\\n, 645 (1)\\n\\n(\\n824 SE2d 382\\n) (2019).” State v. Small, \\n369 Ga. App. 824\\n, 827 n. 2 (\\n892 SE2d 193\\n)\\n\\n(2023). And, we have previously held that a jury’s determination that a defendant is\\n\\nnot guilty of malice murder and felony murder does not defeat a simultaneous, but\\n\\ninconsistent, finding that the defendant is guilty of aggravated assault and possession\\n\\nof a firearm during the commission of a felony committed against the same victim. See\\n\\nTaylor v. State, \\n327 Ga. App. 288\\n, 289 (2) (\\n758 SE2d 629\\n) (2014). See also Smith, 280\\n\\nGa. at 340 (rejecting an argument that a felony murder conviction had to be reversed\\n\\nbecause it was inconsistent with an acquittal on the predicate offense of aggravated\\n\\nassault); Coleman v. State, \\n286 Ga. 291\\n, 295 (4) (\\n687 SE2d 427\\n) (2009) (conviction for\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony allowed to stand despite\\n\\nacquittal for the underlying felony). In this case, nothing on the face of the appellate\\n\\nrecord elucidates the jury’s reasoning for its verdict, and, as such, the precedent\\n\\n\\n                                           11\\n regarding inconsistent verdicts described above applies. See Turner, 283 Ga. at 20-21\\n\\n(2).\\n\\n       With this in mind, we must determine whether there is constitutionally\\n\\nsufficient evidence to support Hall’s conviction for possession of the .9 mm handgun\\n\\nduring any one of the potential felonies, even though the result might be considered\\n\\nto be an inconsistent verdict. With regard to the aggravated assault of Hunt with a\\n\\ndeadly weapon, there is sufficient evidence. Count 4 of the indictment alleged that\\n\\nHall committed aggravated assault “by shooting [Hunt] with a handgun, the same\\n\\nbeing a deadly weapon[.]” It is uncontroverted that Hall took the .9 mm handgun\\n\\nfrom Hunt after the confrontation began and that, while the .9 mm handgun was in\\n\\nHall’s possession and he was actively fighting with Hunt, the weapon was discharged,\\n\\nthereby fatally wounding Hall. As such, there was sufficient evidence to support a\\n\\ndetermination by the jury that Hall was guilty of possession of the .9 mm handgun\\n\\nduring the commission of the felony of the aggravated assault committed by shooting\\n\\nHunt. See Render v. State, \\n257 Ga. App. 477\\n, 478-479 (1) (\\n571 SE2d 493\\n) (2002)\\n\\n(although defendant argued that shooting happened by accident during struggle with\\n\\nvictim, evidence was sufficient to support conviction for aggravated assault).\\n\\n\\n                                         12\\n Accordingly, Hall’s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his\\n\\nconviction for possession of the .9 mm handgun during the commission of a felony\\n\\nalso fails. Id.\\n\\n       2. Hall contends that the trial court erred by admitting certain text messages\\n\\nexchanged between Ashby and Hunt under OCGA § 24-8-807 (“Rule 807”), the\\n\\nresidual exception to the rule against hearsay.10 We disagree.\\n\\n       Rule 807 provides:\\n\\n       A statement not specifically covered by any law but having equivalent\\n       circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness shall not be excluded by the\\n       hearsay rule, if the court determines that:\\n       (1) The statement is offered as evidence of a material fact;\\n       (2) The statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered\\n       than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through\\n       reasonable efforts; and\\n       (3) The general purposes of the rules of evidence and the interests of\\n       justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.11\\n\\n       “Under Rule 807, a trial court’s decision to admit hearsay evidence is reviewed\\n\\nfor an abuse of its discretion.” Tanner v. State, \\n301 Ga. 852\\n, 856 (1) (\\n804 SE2d 377\\n)\\n\\n\\n       10\\n         We note that, although he properly set forth a separate argument section for\\nthis contention, Hall mistakenly omitted the contention from his list of enumerated\\nerrors. Nonetheless, we exercise our discretion to consider Hall’s argument.\\n       11\\n       Hall does not contend on appeal that Hunt’s statements were inadmissible\\nunder Rule 807 because they were “specifically covered” by another law.\\n                                           13\\n (2017). An appellate court should be “particularly hesitant to overturn a trial court’s\\n\\nadmissibility ruling under the residual hearsay exception absent a definite and firm\\n\\nconviction that the court made a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached\\n\\nbased upon a weighing of the relevant factors.” Thompson v. State, \\n302 Ga. 533\\n, 544\\n\\n(IV) (\\n807 SE2d 899\\n) (2017) (citation and punctuation omitted). As a general matter,\\n\\na trial court does not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence when the requirements\\n\\nof OCGA § 24-8-807 (1)-(3) are met, and the trial court concludes that the statements\\n\\nin question have sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness “because of the\\n\\ncircumstances under which they were originally made.” Rawls v. State, \\n310 Ga. 209\\n,\\n\\n214 (3) (a) (\\n850 SE2d 90\\n) (2020) (citation and punctuation omitted). Factors to be\\n\\nconsidered with regard to the admissibility of these statements\\n\\n      include a consideration of the trustworthiness of the original declarant,\\n      given the circumstances in which they were first made, and whether\\n      guarantees of trustworthiness exist that are equivalent in significance to\\n      the specific hearsay exceptions enumerated in Federal Rules of Evidence\\n      803 and 804. Therefore, such guarantees must be equivalent to\\n      cross-examined former testimony, statements under a belief of\\n      impending death, statements against interest, and statements of personal\\n      or family history.\\n\\nState v.\\nHolmes, 304\\n Ga. 524, 529 (2) (a) (\\n820 SE2d 26\\n) (2018) (citation, punctuation\\n\\nand emphasis omitted). In simpler terms, “[w]hether there are exceptional guarantees\\n\\n                                          14\\n of trustworthiness is a determination that focuses on the declarant and the\\n\\ncircumstances under which the declarant made the statement to the witness.” Miller\\n\\nv. State, \\n303 Ga. 1\\n, 5 (2) (\\n810 SE2d 123\\n) (2018) (emphasis omitted). Finally, “[a] trial\\n\\ncourt should consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether to\\n\\nadmit evidence pursuant to OCGA § 24-8-807.” Reyes v. State, \\n309 Ga. 660\\n, 668 (2)\\n\\n(b) (\\n847 SE2d 194\\n) (2020).\\n\\n      Here, the statements contained in the challenged texts provided information\\n\\nregarding the state of Hall’s relationship with Hunt just prior to her death. This\\n\\ninformation was certainly evidence of a material fact, namely the aforementioned\\n\\nrelationship, more probative on that point than any other evidence which could\\n\\nreasonably be procured since Hunt was deceased at the time of trial, and admission of\\n\\nthe evidence, which gave context to the alleged crimes, served the purposes of the\\n\\nrules of evidence and the interests of justice. And, contrary to Hall’s main contention\\n\\non appeal, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the texts between\\n\\nHunt and Ashby contained sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness. Specifically, the\\n\\ntrial court found that the text messages were sufficiently trustworthy because the\\n\\nstatements were “in [Hunt’s] own words[,]” related to the “sensitive nature of\\n\\n\\n                                           15\\n domestic abuse[,]” and shared under circumstances in which the two women were\\n\\n“discovering each other for the first time and discovering that they are both seeing the\\n\\nsame gentleman[.]” Given this consideration of the unique circumstances in which\\n\\nHunt and Ashby shared mutual stories of domestic abuse committed against them by\\n\\nthe same man, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when\\n\\ndetermining trustworthiness or the admissibility of the texts, as the trial court took\\n\\ninto account both the unique characteristics of the declarant and the circumstances\\n\\nin which the statements were made. See Ash v. State, \\n312 Ga. 771\\n, 786 (3) (b) (\\n865\\n\\nSE2d 150\\n) (2021) (statements had sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness where the\\n\\nwitness and declarant had a “close relationship” and “talked to each other daily”);\\n\\nJones v. State, \\n311 Ga. 455\\n, 460 (2) (b) (\\n858 SE2d 462\\n) (2021) (statements had\\n\\nsufficient guarantees of trustworthiness where “there was no evidence indicating that\\n\\n[the declarant] had a motive to fabricate her statements”); Tanner v. State, \\n301 Ga.\\n\\n852\\n, 856 (1) (\\n804 SE2d 377\\n) (2017) (statements had sufficient guarantees of\\n\\ntrustworthiness where witness and declarant “had a close relationship,” declarant had\\n\\n“no apparent reason to lie,” and the “statements were consistent with other\\n\\nevidence”).\\n\\n\\n                                           16\\n Judgment affirmed.

PTAV, INC. v. RALPH + RITA VENTURE, LLC.\\n\\n       On April 4, 2024, the superior court issued an order dismissing as untimely\\ndefendant PTAV, Inc.’s appeal from a magistrate court judgment in this dispossessory\\nproceeding. PTAV then filed both a timely application for discretionary review and,\\non April 15, 2024, a notice of appeal. We denied PTAV’s discretionary application on\\nthe merits. See PTAV, Inc. d/b/a “Red Martini” v. Ralph + Rita Venture, LLC, Case\\nNo. A24D0311 (May 9, 2024). The direct appeal has been docketed as the current\\ncase, no. A24A1474. We lack jurisdiction for two reasons.\\n       First, this appeal is untimely. While a notice of appeal generally may be filed\\nwithin 30 days of entry of the order sought to be appealed, appeals in dispossessory\\nactions must be filed within 7 days of the date the judgment was entered. See OCGA\\n§ 44-7-56 (b) (1); Radio Sandy Springs v. Allen Road Joint Venture, \\n311 Ga. App. 334\\n,\\n335-336 (\\n715 SE2d 752\\n) (2011). PTAV’s April 15 notice of appeal was untimely filed\\n11 days after the April 4 judgment it seeks to appeal.\\n       Second, because we rejected PTAV’s challenges to the April 4 judgment in\\nCase No. A24D0311, the current appeal is barred by the law of the case. See Ross v.\\nState, \\n310 Ga. App. 326\\n, 327 (\\n713 SE2d 438\\n) (2011) (“[A]ny issue that was raised and\\nresolved in an earlier appeal is the law of the case and is binding on this Court . . . .”)\\n(citation and punctuation omitted); accord Hook v.

       " Document(page_content='In the Supreme Court of Georgia\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    Decided: April 16, 2024\\n\\n\\n                S24A0125. STRYKER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n      COLVIN, Justice.\\n\\n      Appellant Austin Stryker appeals his convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and other crimes related to the shooting and stabbing death\\n\\nof Hannah Bender.1 On appeal, Appellant contends that the trial\\n\\n\\n      1 Bender died on September 15, 2019. On December 18, 2019, a Dawson\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Appellant and co-defendants Issac Huff, Dylan\\nReid, and Jerry Harper in connection with Bender’s death. Huff and Reid each\\nentered negotiated guilty pleas in exchange for their testimony at Appellant’s\\ntrial. On July 27, 2021, the grand jury reindicted Appellant and co-defendant\\nHarper in a 29-count indictment related to Bender’s death, which charged\\nAppellant in Counts 1-24 and Harper in Counts 25-29. Appellant was charged\\nwith malice murder (Count 1), three counts of felony murder (Counts 2-4),\\nthree counts of aggravated assault (Counts 5-7), two counts of aggravated\\nbattery (Counts 8-9), possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony\\n(Count 10), possession of a knife during the commission of a felony (Count 10),\\n11 counts of violating the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act (Counts\\n12-22), concealing the death of another (Count 23), and tampering with\\nevidence (Count 24).\\n       Appellant was tried before a jury without Harper from November 1\\nthrough 9, 2021, and the jury returned verdicts of guilty as to all counts. On\\nDecember 15, 2021, the trial court sentenced Appellant to life in prison without\\nthe possibility of parole for malice murder (Count 1) and consecutive sentences\\n court violated his constitutional right to present a complete defense\\n\\nwhen it prevented defense counsel from making a closing argument\\n\\nthat co-defendants Issac Huff and Dylan Reid would have faced\\n\\nminimum sentences of life in prison had they not pled guilty.\\n\\nAppellant also contends that the prosecutor personally attacked\\n\\ndefense counsel in closing argument and that the trial court abused\\n\\nits discretion in overruling his objection to those personal attacks.\\n\\nFinally, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to\\n\\ncharge the jury on “grave suspicion” after, as he contends, the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof 20 years in prison for aggravated battery (Count 9), a total of ten years in\\nprison for possession of a firearm and knife during the commission of a felony\\n(Counts 10 and 11), and ten years in prison for concealing the death of another\\n(Count 23). The court imposed concurrent sentences of 20 years in prison for\\naggravated assault (Count 7), 20 years in prison for each count of violating the\\nStreet Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act (Counts 12-22), and ten years in\\nprison for tampering with evidence (Count 24). The remaining aggravated-\\nassault charges (Counts 5 and 6) and aggravated-battery charge (Count 8)\\nwere merged for sentencing purposes. And although the court purported to\\nmerge the felony-murder counts (Counts 2-4) with malice murder for purposes\\nof sentencing, those counts were actually vacated by operation of law. See\\nMalcom v. State, \\n263 Ga. 369\\n, 371-372 (4) (\\n434 SE2d 479\\n) (1993).\\n      Appellant timely filed a motion for new trial on January 12, 2022, and\\namended the motion on February 28, 2023. Following a hearing on March 14,\\n2023, the trial court denied the motion for new trial, as amended, on June 30,\\n2023. Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal directed to this Court on July\\n12, 2023. The case was docketed to this Court’s December 2024 term and\\nsubmitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                       2\\n prosecutor misconstrued the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in\\n\\nclosing arguments. Although we conclude that Appellant’s claims\\n\\nfail, we have identified merger errors in Appellant’s sentencing that\\n\\nrequire correction. Accordingly, we affirm in part and vacate in part\\n\\nthe judgment below.\\n\\n     1. The evidence presented at trial showed the following.\\n\\nAppellant was a member of a small gang called “THIS,” alongside\\n\\nJerry Harper, Jeremiah Wazar, Dylan Reid, Issac Huff, and Damien\\n\\nEdge. Bailey Williams was also associated with “THIS,” although\\n\\nshe was not an official member, and Bender was Williams’s friend.\\n\\nHuff and Reid testified that the gang sold drugs and committed\\n\\nrobberies, including armed robberies of two stores in the months\\n\\nleading up to Bender’s death. Huff and Williams admitted that they\\n\\nhelped Appellant commit an armed robbery of a store in Dahlonega.\\n\\nHuff also testified that Appellant told him about an armed robbery\\n\\nAppellant and Edge committed in Dawsonville.\\n\\n     Reid testified that, prior to the date of Bender’s death,\\n\\nAppellant mentioned that he suspected Bender was “snitch[ing]”\\n\\n                                 3\\n about the armed robberies committed by the gang and that he\\n\\nwanted to “[g]et rid of her.” Then, in the early hours of September 5,\\n\\n2019, while Appellant, Huff, and Reid were hanging out in Huff’s\\n\\nbasement drinking “[a] little alcohol” and using “[a] little drugs,”\\n\\ntheir conversation turned again to Bender. Reid testified that\\n\\nAppellant made another statement about getting rid of Bender. And\\n\\nHuff testified that the men talked about how they were going to\\n\\n“prove to everybody” that they were “not a joke” by “roughing\\n\\n[Bender] up a little bit or something like that.”\\n\\n     Reid testified that Appellant then asked Reid to send a\\n\\nmessage to Williams telling her that Appellant and Huff were on\\n\\ntheir way to her house. Reid, who stayed behind, testified that, on\\n\\nthe way out of Huff’s residence, Appellant decided to take a pistol\\n\\nAppellant had gotten from a man named Robert Youngblood, saying,\\n\\n“You never know. I might need it.” Huff testified that he then drove\\n\\nAppellant in a Mazda truck to a gas station and then to Williams’s\\n\\nhome. Huff said that he waited in the truck while Appellant talked\\n\\nto Williams inside her home. Williams said that, during this visit,\\n\\n                                  4\\n Appellant asked her to message Bender and told Williams he “had a\\n\\nproblem he needed to deal with.”\\n\\n     Huff drove Appellant to Bender’s house, and Appellant went\\n\\ninside. According to Huff, Appellant planned to convince Bender to\\n\\ncome with them by telling her that they were taking her on a trip to\\n\\nFlorida. And when Bender came out to the truck with Appellant, she\\n\\nwas carrying a duffle bag.\\n\\n     Appellant and Bender sat across from each other in the “two\\n\\nfold-out seats” behind the driver and passenger seats of the truck.\\n\\nAccording to Huff, after they stopped at a gas station to purchase\\n\\ngas and cigarettes, they drove to Appellant’s house because, as Huff\\n\\nlater learned, Appellant suspected that the gas station cameras had\\n\\nrecorded the clothes he had been wearing and he wanted to change\\n\\nclothes. Huff testified that, while Appellant was inside changing,\\n\\nBender talked about how excited she was to visit Florida.\\n\\n     Appellant returned to the truck, and they started driving to\\n\\nHuff’s residence. Huff testified that a few minutes into the drive,\\n\\nAppellant told Huff to “slow down,” so Huff “dropped gears in the\\n\\n                                   5\\n truck.” “[S]hortly after that,” Huff testified, he “heard a shot go off\\n\\nin the back of the truck,” and then Appellant “climb[ed] into the\\n\\nfront seat” and “told [Huff] to drive faster, to go now, get out of\\n\\nthere.”\\n\\n     Huff testified that he heard “a gurgling-type noise” coming\\n\\nfrom Bender after the shooting, and when they arrived at Huff’s\\n\\nhouse, Huff saw that Bender was slumped over in the back seat in a\\n\\npool of blood. Huff then went into the house, woke up Reid, and told\\n\\nReid to go outside.\\n\\n     Reid testified that he walked outside, finding Appellant\\n\\nshirtless and wiping Reid’s knife on the ground. Appellant\\n\\ninstructed Reid to grab a trash bag and a blanket from inside the\\n\\nhouse, which he did. Appellant then instructed Reid to help him get\\n\\nBender’s body out of the truck. Reid testified that he and Appellant\\n\\nput a trash bag over Bender’s head, pulled her out of the truck,\\n\\nwrapped her in a blanket, and threw her body in a nearby firepit.\\n\\nAccording to Huff, Appellant told him not to let anyone walk near\\n\\nthe firepit, and Reid recalled Appellant telling Huff “to keep an eye\\n\\n                                  6\\n on her [be]cause she may still be alive.” Appellant and Reid then\\n\\ndrove the Mazda to Appellant’s house, where they retrieved\\n\\nAppellant’s Ford Explorer.\\n\\n     Huff testified that when Appellant and Reid returned to Huff’s\\n\\nhouse, Appellant told Huff that they were going to get rid of all the\\n\\nevidence. Reid said that he and Appellant then drove the Ford to\\n\\nWilliams’s house, where, according to Williams, Appellant told her\\n\\nshe needed to go with them. Williams testified that they drove the\\n\\nFord to Appellant’s house, where Appellant got into the Mazda with\\n\\nReid, and that Appellant asked Williams to follow them in the Ford\\n\\nand swerve if she saw any cops to distract them.\\n\\n     Shortly after leaving Appellant’s house, Appellant stopped the\\n\\ncar and told Reid to switch places with Williams. Williams testified\\n\\nthat, when she got into the truck, she smelled blood and saw blood\\n\\n“everywhere.” After driving a while, they stopped at the end of a\\n\\ngravel road, and Appellant instructed Reid to return the Ford to\\n\\nAppellant’s wife before she went to work, which he did.\\n\\n     Williams testified that she and Appellant then drove to a\\n\\n                                 7\\n campground, where Appellant disposed of Bender’s belongings.\\n\\nAccording to Williams, Appellant also unbolted the two front seats\\n\\nof the truck at the campground but did not remove them because a\\n\\npark ranger was nearby. Later, they drove to Youngblood’s property,\\n\\nwhere Harper’s camper was located. According to Williams,\\n\\nAppellant talked about Bender during the drive, saying that he “shot\\n\\nher” and that, “when she didn’t die right away[,] . . . he stabbed her.”\\n\\nWilliams further testified that Appellant said, “I had to do it, didn’t\\n\\nI? A rat is a rat. I had to do it.”\\n\\n     Youngblood testified that Appellant asked for help, and\\n\\nYoungblood agreed to drive Appellant. Appellant then directed\\n\\nYoungblood to a campground, where, according to Youngblood,\\n\\nAppellant got out to look for something. Youngblood testified that,\\n\\nat some point, Appellant talked to him about Bender, saying that he\\n\\n“thought that she was undercover” and had “stabbed her.”\\n\\n     Appellant returned to Huff’s house later to retrieve the body\\n\\nfrom the firepit. With Reid’s help, Appellant moved Bender’s body\\n\\ninto a toolbox from the bed of the Mazda truck. Appellant’s wife then\\n\\n                                      8\\n drove the Ford to Huff’s house, and they loaded the toolbox\\n\\ncontaining Bender’s body into the vehicle. Appellant, Appellant’s\\n\\nwife, Appellant’s baby, and Reid all drove in the Ford to\\n\\nYoungblood’s property. They left the toolbox containing Bender’s\\n\\nbody by a camper, which the evidence showed belonged to Harper,\\n\\nand then stripped out parts of the Mazda. Reid said that they bagged\\n\\nup the Mazda parts and then drove them to another location, where\\n\\nthey threw the parts off the side of a hill.\\n\\n     Later, Harper drove the Mazda to a local farmer’s property\\n\\nwith Appellant following him in the Ford. The farmer testified that\\n\\nHarper offered him the Mazda, and that he agreed to take it.\\n\\nAccording to the farmer, Harper and Appellant then went down to a\\n\\ncreek on the property. The farmer believed that they were going\\n\\ndown to the creek “to get some sand,” but Reid testified that\\n\\nAppellant buried Bender’s body there.\\n\\n     Appellant asked Huff and Reid to put dirt on Bender’s body\\n\\nevery few days to prevent it from being discovered. Appellant also\\n\\nseparately asked Huff, Reid, and Williams to drive him out of the\\n\\n                                   9\\n state, but they declined, and Harper ultimately drove Appellant to\\n\\nWest Virginia. 2\\n\\n      Youngblood testified that he kept a loaded pistol on top of his\\n\\nrefrigerator, that Appellant had taken the gun without Youngblood’s\\n\\nknowledge or permission, and that the gun was unloaded when\\n\\nAppellant returned it. After hearing that Bender was missing and\\n\\ndiscovering bloodstained clothing in his laundry room, Youngblood\\n\\ncalled the police and turned over the clothing and his gun. Prompted\\n\\nby a news report, the farmer also contacted the police, and officers\\n\\ntook possession of the Mazda truck.\\n\\n      Investigators discovered Bender’s body buried in a shallow\\n\\ngrave by the creek on the farmer’s property on September 25, 2019.\\n\\nThe medical examiner who performed Bender’s autopsy testified\\n\\nthat Bender’s injuries consisted of a single gunshot wound to the\\n\\nhead and 32 stab wounds to her head, neck, chest, abdomen, back,\\n\\nand arms. The medical examiner said that the bullet entered\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 In October 2019, Appellant turned himself in and was extradited back\\n\\nto Georgia.\\n                                    10\\n Bender’s forehead at a downward angle, and he agreed that it was\\n\\n“extremely unlikely” that someone would accidentally shoot\\n\\nthemselves in that manner. He also testified that he observed\\n\\nfractures of three ribs “consistent with having been caused by the\\n\\nstab wounds.” The medical examiner determined that the cause of\\n\\nBender’s death was the gunshot wound, the stab wounds, or a\\n\\ncombination of both.\\n\\n     A crime scene specialist examined the Mazda truck and found\\n\\nhigh-velocity blood spatter that was consistent with a gunshot to the\\n\\nhead in the rear passenger side of the vehicle, as well as medium-\\n\\nvelocity blood spatter in the truck that was consistent with castoff\\n\\nfrom a hand or weapon. DNA testing revealed that blood samples\\n\\ntaken from the Mazda matched Bender’s DNA profile, and that DNA\\n\\nsamples taken from the inside and outside of a pair of jeans\\n\\nrecovered from Youngblood’s house matched Appellant’s and\\n\\nBender’s DNA profiles, respectively.\\n\\n     A ballistics expert testified that, based on his analysis of bullet\\n\\nfragments recovered from the medical examiner and the firearm\\n\\n                                  11\\n recovered from Youngblood, the bullet was fired from Youngblood’s\\n\\ngun. He also opined that, due to the gun’s design, holding the gun\\n\\nimproperly could make it “a lot more difficult to fire.”\\n\\n     Testifying in his own defense at trial, Appellant confirmed\\n\\nmany of the details testified to by other witnesses. Specifically,\\n\\nAppellant testified that he was a member of a gang called “THIS,”\\n\\nthat he committed an armed robbery in 2019 with Huff, Wazar, and\\n\\nWilliams, and that he had smoked methamphetamine and drank\\n\\nalcohol while in Huff’s basement with Huff and Reid in the early\\n\\nhours of September 15, 2019.\\n\\n     Diverging from Huff’s and Reid’s accounts, however, Appellant\\n\\ntestified that he left Huff’s house to go steal methamphetamine from\\n\\na drug dealer known as “Cuz.” Appellant testified that he and Huff\\n\\ndrove to Williams’s house because he thought Cuz might be there.\\n\\nAfter discovering that Cuz was not there and “smok[ing] a little\\n\\ndope,” Appellant asked Williams to come with them, thinking that\\n\\nit would be easier to find Cuz if Williams was the one to contact him\\n\\nbecause “[p]eople who sell drugs like beautiful women.” When\\n\\n                                  12\\n Williams declined, Appellant decided to ask Bender for help instead\\n\\nbecause Bender and Cuz had previously had “a romantic\\n\\nrelationship for a long time,” and Appellant knew that Bender “had\\n\\na crush on [Appellant].” Appellant testified that he and Huff then\\n\\nwent to Bender’s house, where he went inside and told her that he\\n\\n“had the tools necessary to rob Cuz” and that they would go to\\n\\nFlorida after robbing Cuz.\\n\\n     According to Appellant, as they were driving, Bender asked\\n\\nhim if he had a gun. Appellant said that he responded by tapping\\n\\nhis right pocket, and, when “[s]he looked at [him] kind of funny,” he\\n\\n“pulled [the gun] out, dropped the clip real quick, trying to seem\\n\\ncool,” and “handed it to her.” Describing how Bender held the gun,\\n\\nAppellant said “[s]he ha[d] it in her left hand with her fingers back,”\\n\\nher “index finger pointing up,” “her thumb in the trigger guard,” and\\n\\nthe gun “pointed at her head,” which Appellant said was\\n\\n“[c]ompletely opposite of how you would hold a gun.” Appellant\\n\\ntestified that he had told Huff to slow down because Huff was\\n\\ndriving too fast, and that, when he saw the gun was pointed at\\n\\n                                  13\\n Bender’s head, he realized he had not cleared the chamber and tried\\n\\nto say, “Hey.” According to Appellant, he did not “remember a jerk\\n\\nin the vehicle,” only that there “was the gunshot,” and Bender\\n\\n“immediately slump[ed] over.” Appellant said that he then picked\\n\\nup the gun, jumped in the front seat, “said a cuss word and told\\n\\n[Huff] to go. Hurry. Get to the house.”\\n\\n     Appellant testified that, after arriving at Huff’s house, he tried\\n\\nto remove Bender from the truck, but she was too heavy. He said\\n\\nthat Bender did not show any signs of life and there was a knife in\\n\\nthe passenger seat of the truck, so he stabbed her for a “[c]ouple of\\n\\nminutes,” thinking “maybe [he] could make her weigh less” if he\\n\\n“drain[ed] the blood.” Appellant also admitted that he tried to cover\\n\\nup Bender’s death, testifying that he put her body in a firepit at\\n\\nHuff’s house, disposed of her belongings at a campground,\\n\\ntransported Bender’s body in a toolbox, stripped out parts of the\\n\\nMazda and disposed of them, attempted to get rid of the Mazda, and\\n\\nburied Bender’s body. But he denied murdering Bender.\\n\\n     2. Appellant argues that the trial court violated his right under\\n\\n                                  14\\n the United States Constitution to present a complete defense when\\n\\nit prohibited him from making a closing argument about the specific\\n\\nsentences Huff and Reid avoided by pleading guilty. We conclude,\\n\\nhowever, that any error in limiting the scope of Appellant’s closing\\n\\nargument was harmless.\\n\\n     At trial, Huff and Reid each testified about their plea deals.\\n\\nHuff testified that he had initially been charged with felony murder\\n\\nas an accomplice in the case and that he had pled guilty to the lesser\\n\\noffenses of aggravated assault, concealing a death, and violating the\\n\\nStreet Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act in exchange for testifying\\n\\nat Appellant’s trial and receiving a reduced sentence of 30 years with\\n\\n12 to serve. He further testified that he understood felony murder\\n\\ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison, and that he\\n\\nwas concerned that his plea deal could be revoked and he could\\n\\nreceive a harsher sentence if he lied at trial. Reid similarly testified\\n\\nthat he had initially been charged with felony murder in connection\\n\\nwith the case and that he had pled guilty to aggravated assault,\\n\\nconcealing the death of another, tampering with evidence, and\\n\\n                                  15\\n violating the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act in exchange\\n\\nfor testifying at Appellant’s trial and receiving a sentence of 35 years\\n\\nwith 15 to serve. On cross-examination, Reid agreed that “15 [years\\n\\nwas] a hell of a lot better than life” and admitted that he felt like he\\n\\nwas in a tough situation because prosecutors had met with him\\n\\nbefore trial, making it clear that, if he said anything different at trial\\n\\nthan he had said during his plea colloquy, they would take steps to\\n\\nrevoke his plea deal.\\n\\n     During closing arguments, defense counsel attempted to use a\\n\\ndemonstrative, which defense counsel described as “a slide on the\\n\\nrisks that [Huff and Reid] avoided, [the] sentence they avoided[,] by\\n\\ntaking a plea deal.” 3 But the court prohibited defense counsel from\\n\\nusing the demonstrative or “talk[ing] about a minimum of life in\\n\\nprison” because it was concerned that, “by conveniently talking\\n\\nabout what [sentences Huff and Reid] could have gotten, [counsel\\n\\nwas improperly] talking about what [sentence Appellant] could get.”\\n\\nThe court ruled that defense counsel could argue only that Huff and\\n\\n\\n     3 The demonstrative is not in the record on appeal.\\n\\n                                    16\\n Reid “were charged with felony murder, and it was reduced.”\\n\\n     Defense counsel then argued to the jury that, although Huff\\n\\nwas “one of the most reliable individuals here,” Huff and Reid were\\n\\nnoticeably “reluctant or hesitant” to testify, that Reid had admitted\\n\\n“he was in a tough spot,” and that both men “had been charged with\\n\\nfelony murder” but “bargained with the State” to “ple[a]d guilty to\\n\\nsomething that did not include the word ‘murder’” so they could\\n\\nreceive reduced sentences of 12 and 15 years in prison, respectively.\\n\\nDefense counsel further argued that the plea deals “may have\\n\\nshaped, colored, [or] influenced their testimony” and caused Huff\\n\\nand Reid to “fill[ ] in some gaps after the fact” because they were\\n\\ntrying to make a deal with the State, which needed information that\\n\\nonly Huff and Reid could provide, namely, “what happened to\\n\\n[Bender], what was the cause and manner of her death.”\\n\\n     On appeal, Appellant argues that the limitation the trial court\\n\\nimposed on his closing argument violated his “federal constitutional\\n\\nright” to present a defense because he was unable to argue bias\\n\\nbased on the fact that Huff and Reid avoided mandatory minimum\\n\\n                                 17\\n sentences of life in prison by pleading guilty and testifying at\\n\\nAppellant’s trial.\\n\\n     The right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to\\n\\nthe United States Constitution, which is “extended to a defendant\\n\\nin   a   state   criminal   prosecution   through    the   Fourteenth\\n\\nAmendment,” includes a “right of the defense to make a closing\\n\\nsummary of the evidence to the trier of facts.” Herring v. New York,\\n\\n422 U.S. 853\\n, 857, 860 (II) (95 SCt 2550, 45 LE2d 593) (1975). Cf.\\n\\nNevada v. Jackson, \\n569 U.S. 505\\n, 509 (II) (133 SCt 1990, 186 LE2d\\n\\n62) (2013) (“The Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a\\n\\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense[.]” (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)). That right is violated where a trial court\\n\\n“den[ies] absolutely the opportunity for any closing summation at\\n\\nall.” Herring, \\n422 U.S. at 863\\n (II). But the United States Supreme\\n\\nCourt has never held that a restriction on closing arguments falling\\n\\nshort of a complete denial of an opportunity for closing summation\\n\\nviolates the federal Constitution. See Glebe v. Frost, \\n574 U.S. 21\\n, 23-\\n\\n24 (135 SCt 429, 190 LE2d 317) (2014) (“[a]ssuming for argument’s\\n\\n                                  18\\n sake that the trial court violated the Constitution” by “restricti[ng]”\\n\\nthe arguments defense counsel could present in closing (emphasis\\n\\nomitted)). And the Court has further clarified that trial courts “have\\n\\nbroad discretion” and are “given great latitude in . . . limiting the\\n\\nscope of closing summations.” Herring, \\n422 U.S. at 862\\n (II).\\n\\n     Assuming without deciding that the trial court violated\\n\\nAppellant’s federal constitutional right to make a closing argument\\n\\nby preventing defense counsel from referencing the specific\\n\\nsentences that Huff and Reid avoided by pleading guilty, we\\n\\nconclude that any error was harmless. It is well established that “an\\n\\nerror of constitutional magnitude, such as the denial of the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment right to counsel, can be harmless if the State can prove\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the\\n\\nverdict.” Muse v. State, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n, 657 (5) (c) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). See Glebe, 574 U.S. at 23-24\\n\\n(holding that, “even assuming that [the U.S. Supreme Court’s\\n\\ndecision in] Herring established that complete denial of summation\\n\\namounts to structural error, it did not clearly establish that the\\n\\n                                  19\\n restriction of summation also amounts to structural error,” and\\n\\nnoting that “[m]ost constitutional mistakes call for reversal only if\\n\\nthe government cannot demonstrate harmlessness” (emphasis in\\n\\noriginal)). See also State v. Frost, \\n160 Wash. 2d 765\\n, 782 (2) (161 P3d\\n\\n361) (2007) (en banc) (holding that the standard for reviewing a trial\\n\\ncourt’s erroneous limitation on the scope of defense counsel’s closing\\n\\nargument was proof “beyond a reasonable doubt that any reasonable\\n\\njury would have convicted [the defendant], even absent the trial\\n\\ncourt’s limitation on counsel’s argument” (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)); United States v. Real, \\n45 Fed. Appx. 647\\n, 650 (4) (9th Cir.\\n\\n2002) (unpublished) (holding that “[t]he district court erred in\\n\\ndisallowing [the defendant’s] argument,” which “was not misleading\\n\\nand was fairly raised by the evidence,” but that the error “was\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt”).\\n\\n     Here, any error in limiting Appellant’s closing argument was\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt because Appellant’s convictions\\n\\nwere supported by overwhelming evidence that came not just from\\n\\nHuff and Reid, but from Appellant himself, as well as other sources.\\n\\n                                  20\\n Appellant admitted on the stand that he stabbed Bender and\\n\\ncovered up her death by putting her body in a firepit, transporting\\n\\nher body in a toolbox, removing parts of the truck where she was\\n\\nshot, disposing of her belongings, getting rid of the truck, and\\n\\nultimately burying her body. Thus, the only disputed issue at trial\\n\\nwas whether Appellant shot Bender or Bender had instead\\n\\naccidentally shot herself.\\n\\n     The trial evidence overwhelmingly showed that Appellant,\\n\\nrather than Bender, fired the bullet that struck Bender, and that he\\n\\ndid so with malice aforethought. Williams, who testified without the\\n\\nbenefit of a negotiated plea deal, said that Appellant had admitted\\n\\nto her that he shot Bender and stabbed her when she did not\\n\\nimmediately die because she was a “rat.” And Youngblood similarly\\n\\ntestified that Appellant had admitted to him that he stabbed Bender\\n\\nbelieving she was an undercover informant. Further, the medical\\n\\nexaminer testified that the bullet’s trajectory through Bender’s head\\n\\nmade it unlikely that the wound resulted from an accidental, self-\\n\\ninflicted gunshot. And the ballistics expert testified that improperly\\n\\n                                 21\\n holding the gun, as Appellant claimed Bender had done, could have\\n\\nmade it even more difficult to fire the gun accidentally.\\n\\n     Thus,        there   was   overwhelming   evidence   undermining\\n\\nAppellant’s defense and proving his guilt. Cf. Ricketts v. State, \\n276\\n\\nGa. 466\\n, 471 (4) (\\n579 SE2d 205\\n) (2003) (holding that an erroneous\\n\\nlimitation on the appellant’s closing argument was harmless\\n\\nbecause the “evidence rendered [the appellant’s] story that he acted\\n\\nout of the heat of passion virtually without belief”). In addition to\\n\\nthe overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt, the jury also heard\\n\\ntestimony from Reid and Huff from which they could conclude that\\n\\nReid and Huff received greatly reduced sentences by entering pleas\\n\\nto charges less than murder, and defense counsel was able to make\\n\\nthat argument in closing, albeit without specifically arguing that\\n\\nReid and Huff would have received minimum life sentences. And, as\\n\\na result, any error in limiting the scope of defense counsel’s closing\\n\\nargument “was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Muse, 316 Ga.\\n\\nat 657 (5) (c).\\n\\n     Appellant argues for a different result based on Palma v. State,\\n\\n                                    22\\n 280 Ga. 108\\n (\\n624 SE2d 137\\n) (2005). In that case, we concluded that\\n\\nthe trial court had erroneously prevented defense counsel from\\n\\n“pointing out to the jury in argument the extent of the benefit th[at]\\n\\nwitnesses received from agreeing to testify against [the defendant]”\\n\\nbased on evidence introduced at trial about “the specific punishment\\n\\nthe witnesses received and the potential punishments they avoided\\n\\nby agreeing to testify.” \\nId. at 110\\n (2). And we concluded that the\\n\\nappellant was entitled to a new trial. See \\nid.\\n\\n\\n     But Appellant’s reliance on Palma is misplaced. First, Palma\\n\\ndid not address a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to make\\n\\na closing argument. Rather, we concluded in Palma that the trial\\n\\ncourt’s ruling had deprived the appellant of a right recognized in our\\n\\ndecisional law “to argue all reasonable inferences arising from the\\n\\nevidence presented in the trial.” Palma, \\n280 Ga. at 110\\n (2). Second,\\n\\nin resolving the appellant’s claim, Palma applied a standard of\\n\\nreview derived from our precedent concerning violations of a\\n\\ncriminal defendant’s statutory right to make a closing argument of\\n\\na particular duration. See \\nid.\\n (“A presumption of harm requiring the\\n\\n                                 23\\n grant of a new trial accompanies the abridgement of the right to\\n\\nmake a closing argument, and that presumption is overcome ‘when\\n\\nthe denial of the right is not complete and only in those extreme\\n\\ncases in which the evidence of a defendant’s guilt is so overwhelming\\n\\nthat it renders any other version of events virtually without belief.’”\\n\\n(quoting Hendricks v. State, \\n277 Ga. 61\\n, 62-63 (3) (\\n586 SE2d 317\\n)\\n\\n(2003)). See, e.g., Hendricks, \\n277 Ga. at 62-63\\n (3) (addressing an\\n\\nalleged violation of OCGA § 17-8-73, which governs the duration of\\n\\nclosing arguments in criminal cases); Hayes v. State, \\n268 Ga. 809\\n,\\n\\n813 (7) (\\n493 SE2d 169\\n) (1997) (same). And we have previously\\n\\nindicated that cases addressing violations of “the statutory\\n\\nrequirement that counsel be given [a certain amount of time] for\\n\\nclosing argument . . . do not” supply the standard for assessing a\\n\\nclaimed violation of a constitutional right to present a closing\\n\\nargument. Knighton v. State, \\n310 Ga. 586\\n, 595-596 (2) (b) & n.8 (\\n853\\n\\nSE2d 89\\n) (2020) (emphasis supplied) (addressing a claimed violation\\n\\nof the defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial based on\\n\\ninterruptions that allegedly prevented defense counsel “from\\n\\n                                  24\\n making a full closing argument”). Finally, Palma is distinguishable\\n\\nbecause there we concluded that the trial court’s error was not\\n\\nharmless because the evidence of guilt was not “overwhelming.”\\n\\nPalma, \\n280 Ga. at 110\\n (2). Here, by contrast, overwhelming evidence\\n\\nestablished Appellant’s guilt. Accordingly, this claim fails.\\n\\n     3. Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in\\n\\noverruling his objection that the prosecutor personally attacked\\n\\ndefense counsel during closing arguments. We discern no abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion.\\n\\n     As an initial matter, Appellant did not make contemporaneous\\n\\nobjections to most of the prosecutor’s statements that he now\\n\\nchallenges on appeal, so his challenges to those statements are not\\n\\npreserved for appellate review. See Moon v. State, \\n311 Ga. 421\\n, 426\\n\\n(4) (\\n858 SE2d 18\\n) (2021) (noting that “we do not review unpreserved\\n\\nchallenges to closing arguments in non-death penalty cases, even for\\n\\nplain error”); Chapa v. State, \\n288 Ga. 505\\n, 506 (2) (\\n705 SE2d 646\\n)\\n\\n(2011) (holding that the appellant’s argument that the prosecutor\\n\\nmade an improper closing argument “ha[d] not been preserved for\\n\\n                                  25\\n appeal because appellant failed to object to the prosecutor’s closing\\n\\nargument at the time”).\\n\\n     Appellant raised only one objection during closing arguments\\n\\nrelated to this enumeration of error. Specifically, Appellant objected\\n\\nthat the prosecutor had made an improper “personal attack” after\\n\\nthe prosecutor said that “the defense’s argument” was “[a]s\\n\\nreasonable as saying that aliens came down and shot Hannah\\n\\nBender,” that the argument “d[id] not compute with common sense,”\\n\\nand that “they are insulting our intelligence[,] [t]hey’re insulting the\\n\\nwhole process, and they’re insulting and disrespecting Hannah\\n\\nBender’s memory.” Following Appellant’s objection, the prosecutor\\n\\noffered to move on, and the court did not rule on the objection. Then,\\n\\nafter the court charged the jury, Appellant asked for a ruling on his\\n\\nobjection to the prosecutor’s statements.4 The court overruled the\\n\\nobjection, finding that the prosecutor’s argument “didn’t have\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 Although Appellant asked the trial court to give a “curative instruction\\n\\nof the sympathy charge,” Appellant does not argue on appeal that the\\nprosecutor made improper sympathy arguments in closing, so we do not\\naddress that issue.\\n                                     26\\n anything to do with” defense counsel or “say you were somehow bad\\n\\nlawyers or had done something improper or unethical.” In its order\\n\\ndenying Appellant’s motion for new trial, the court reached the same\\n\\nconclusion, finding that the prosecutor’s argument was not in fact a\\n\\npersonal attack but instead an attack on the defense’s theory of the\\n\\ncase.\\n\\n        Assuming without deciding that Appellant’s objection that the\\n\\nprosecutor personally attacked defense counsel in closing arguments\\n\\nis adequately preserved for appellate review, even though defense\\n\\ncounsel did not obtain a ruling on the objection until after closing\\n\\narguments concluded and the court had charged the jury, Appellant\\n\\nhas not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling\\n\\nthe objection. Appellant argues that the prosecutor’s argument was\\n\\n“essentially the same” as the one that the Court of Appeals\\n\\nconcluded was improper and required a new trial in Estep v. State,\\n\\n129 Ga. App. 909\\n (\\n201 SE2d 809\\n) (1973). But Estep is not analogous\\n\\nto this case.5 In Estep, the Court of Appeals concluded that the\\n\\n\\n        5 We express no opinion as to whether Estep was correctly decided.\\n\\n                                       27\\n prosecutor had made improper “comment[s] that opposing counsel\\n\\nkn[ew] the defendant to be guilty [and] kn[ew] his client’s case [was]\\n\\nnot meritorious” when the prosecutor told the jury that defense\\n\\ncounsel was “a good friend of mine” and that “he knows he doesn’t\\n\\nhave any merits on this case and he is just trying to confuse you.”\\n\\nId. at 915-916\\n (8) (punctuation omitted). Here, by contrast, the\\n\\nprosecutor did not indicate that he had a personal relationship with\\n\\ndefense counsel or knew that defense counsel believed Appellant\\n\\nwas guilty.\\n\\n     Further, the context surrounding the prosecutor’s remarks\\n\\nsupported the trial court’s finding that the prosecutor was\\n\\nchallenging the reasonableness of the defense theory, not, as\\n\\nAppellant contends, making an ad hominem attack on defense\\n\\ncounsel. Specifically, in the objected-to portion of the prosecutor’s\\n\\nargument, the prosecutor expressly said that it was “the defense’s\\n\\nargument” that was unreasonable. (Emphasis supplied.) As a result,\\n\\nthe trial court reasonably interpreted the prosecutor’s following\\n\\nremarks about the defense “insulting our intelligence,” “insulting\\n\\n                                 28\\n the whole process,” and “insulting and disrespecting Hannah\\n\\nBender’s memory” as criticisms of the theory of the defense, not of\\n\\ndefense counsel personally. See Gissendaner v. State, \\n272 Ga. 704\\n,\\n\\n713 (10) (a) (\\n532 SE2d 677\\n) (2000) (affirming the trial court’s\\n\\nrejection of defense counsel’s argument that the prosecutor made an\\n\\nimproper “personal attack” during closing arguments where the\\n\\nprosecutor said that “[w]hat you just heard from defense counsel has\\n\\ndone a tremendous violence to the truth in this case” and that\\n\\ndefense counsel’s argument was “an insult to the truth”\\n\\n(punctuation omitted)). Accordingly, this claim fails.\\n\\n     4. Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in failing to\\n\\ncharge the jury on “grave suspicion” after, as Appellant claims, the\\n\\nprosecutor misconstrued the burden of proof in closing arguments.\\n\\nSee Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases\\n\\n(2007), § 1.20.20 Grave Suspicion (“Facts and circumstances that\\n\\nmerely place upon the defendant a grave suspicion of the crime\\n\\ncharged or that merely raise a speculation or conjecture of the\\n\\ndefendant’s guilt are not sufficient to authorize a conviction of the\\n\\n                                 29\\n defendant.”). This argument also fails.\\n\\n     In closing argument, defense counsel drew attention to the\\n\\nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, explaining that there were\\n\\nthree different standards of proof commonly used in the judicial\\n\\nsystem. Defense counsel said that the preponderance-of-the-\\n\\nevidence standard was “the lowest standard of proof”; “[t]he next\\n\\nlevel up from that is clear and convincing evidence,” which is “a high\\n\\nthreshold” that is “above preponderance” and “below proof beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt”; and “[h]igher than that is” proof beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt, which “does not mean proof to a mathematical\\n\\ncertainty[,] . . . but it’s close.” Responding to defense counsel’s\\n\\nstatements about the standard of proof, the State argued:\\n\\n     The judge is not going to tell you about clear and\\n     convincing evidence or preponderance or how reasonable\\n     doubt is higher than clear or lower than clear. That’s not\\n     what the judge is going to tell you because that’s not the\\n     law. . . . What you’re going to get from the judge is\\n     reasonable doubt means just what it is. A reasonable\\n     doubt is a doubt based upon—once again I’m highlighting\\n     these words—common sense and reason. It’s that basic.\\n     It’s that basic. You’re not going to see a chart about clear\\n     and convincing, and it’s higher than that. That’s just\\n     inaccurate. . . . So the judge will tell you that reasonable\\n\\n                                 30\\n      doubt is a doubt based upon common sense and reason.\\n\\nAppellant did not object to this statement. And following closing\\n\\narguments, the court charged the jury on, among other things, the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, the State’s burden to prove guilt beyond\\n\\na reasonable doubt, and the definition of reasonable doubt as “doubt\\n\\nof a fair-minded, impartial juror honestly seeking the truth[,] . . . a\\n\\ndoubt based upon common sense and reason.”\\n\\n     Because Appellant did not object to the trial court’s failure to\\n\\ngive a “grave suspicion” charge following the court’s charge to the\\n\\njury, we review Appellant’s claim only for plain error. See Rountree\\n\\nv. State, \\n316 Ga. 691\\n, 693 (1) (\\n889 SE2d 803\\n) (2023) (noting that\\n\\n“objections at a charge conference do not suffice to preserve\\n\\nobjections to the charge as subsequently given,” and holding that the\\n\\ntrial court’s failure to give the defendant’s requested jury instruction\\n\\ncould be reviewed only for plain error because he “made no objection\\n\\nwhen the trial court finished reading the charge to the jury” (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)). To show that a trial court plainly erred\\n\\nin failing to give a jury instruction, “an appellant must show that (1)\\n\\n                                  31\\n the alleged error was not affirmatively waived, (2) it was obvious\\n\\nbeyond reasonable dispute, . . . (3) it affected the appellant’s\\n\\nsubstantial rights,” and (4) it “seriously affected the fairness,\\n\\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Willis v. State,\\n\\n315 Ga. 19\\n, 26 (3) (b) (\\n880 SE2d 158\\n) (2022) (citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Appellant has not shown any error, much less plain error.\\n\\nWhen evaluating whether a trial court erred in failing to give a jury\\n\\ninstruction, “we view the charge as a whole to determine whether\\n\\nthe jury was fully and fairly instructed.” Clark v. State, \\n315 Ga. 423\\n,\\n\\n440 (4) (\\n883 SE2d 317\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\nHere, a “grave suspicion” charge was unnecessary to fully and fairly\\n\\ninstruct the jury because that charge was adequately covered by the\\n\\ncharge as a whole, which included instructions on, among other\\n\\nthings, the presumption of innocence, the State’s burden to prove\\n\\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the definition of reasonable\\n\\ndoubt. See Payne v. State, Case No. S23A1205, __ Ga. __, __ (4) (__\\n\\nSE2d __) (2024) (holding that the trial court did not err in failing to\\n\\n                                   32\\n instruct the jury on grave suspicion because “the trial court’s\\n\\ninstructions on reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence,\\n\\nmere presence, and mere association adequately covered the\\n\\nrequested grave suspicion charge”); Adkins v. State, \\n314 Ga. 477\\n,\\n\\n483 (3) (\\n887 SE2d 582\\n) (2022) (holding that the trial court did not\\n\\nerr in failing to instruct the jury on grave suspicion “because the\\n\\nconcept was covered in other jury instructions,” including\\n\\ninstructions on reasonable doubt and the presumption of\\n\\ninnocence). And even assuming that the prosecutor misconstrued\\n\\nthe burden of proof, Appellant has not explained how a grave\\n\\nsuspicion instruction would have resolved any confusion caused by\\n\\nthe prosecutor’s statements. Nor has he shown that the trial court’s\\n\\ninstructions, as given, were insufficient to resolve any such\\n\\nconfusion. Accordingly, Appellant has not established plain error.\\n\\n    5. Although Appellant has not raised the issue on appeal, we\\n\\nhave identified two merger issues in his sentencing. See Goodman\\n\\nv. State, \\n313 Ga. 762\\n, 770 (2) (c) (\\n873 SE2d 150\\n) (2022) (noting that\\n\\n“we often . . . exercise our discretion sua sponte to vacate a sentence\\n\\n                                  33\\n for the benefit of defendants if we notice that it is void”); Jackson v.\\n\\nCrickmar, \\n311 Ga. 870\\n, 873 (2) (\\n860 SE2d 709\\n) (2021) (noting that\\n\\na sentence imposed on “a conviction that merges with another\\n\\nconviction is void” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n    To authorize separate convictions for aggravated assault and\\n\\nmalice murder of a single victim, or for aggravated battery and\\n\\nmalice murder of a single victim, the trial evidence must show “that\\n\\nthe defendant committed an aggravated assault [or aggravated\\n\\nbattery] independent of the act that caused the victim’s death.”\\n\\nEdwards v. State, \\n301 Ga. 822\\n, 828-829 (4) (a), (b) (\\n804 SE2d 404\\n)\\n\\n(2017). This requires evidence not only that there was a “deliberate\\n\\ninterval” between the infliction of two separate wounds but also\\n\\nthat one of the wounds was “fatal” while the other was “non-fatal.”\\n\\nWillis v. State, \\n304 Ga. 686\\n, 692 (2) (\\n820 SE2d 640\\n) (2018) (citation,\\n\\npunctuation, and emphasis omitted).\\n\\n    The record reflects that Appellant was charged with\\n\\ncommitting malice murder “by shooting [Bender] and by stabbing\\n\\n[Bender]” (Count 1), committing aggravated assault “by shooting\\n\\n                                  34\\n [Bender] and by stabbing [Bender]” (Count 7), and committing\\n\\naggravated battery “by seriously disfiguring [Bender’s] body by\\n\\nstabbing [Bender]” (Count 9). The trial court did not merge for\\n\\nsentencing purposes Counts 7 and 9 with Count 1 but rather\\n\\nimposed a 20-year concurrent sentence for Count 7 and a 20-year\\n\\nconsecutive sentence for Count 9. This was error.\\n\\n    Although the trial evidence showed that there was a\\n\\n“deliberate interval” between Appellant shooting Bender and\\n\\nAppellant subsequently stabbing her, the evidence did not support\\n\\na finding that any shooting or stabbing wounds inflicted on Bender\\n\\nbefore she died were “non-fatal.” Willis, \\n304 Ga. at 692\\n (2) (citation,\\n\\npunctuation, and emphasis omitted). To the contrary, the evidence\\n\\nshowed that any shooting or stabbing wounds Bender sustained\\n\\nbefore she died were fatal. Specifically, the medical examiner\\n\\ntestified that the “cause of death” was the “gunshot wound to the\\n\\nhead and stab wounds,” as Bender had died from “either the\\n\\ngunshot wound or the stab wounds or some combination of those.”\\n\\nBecause the trial evidence failed to show “that the defendant\\n\\n                                  35\\n committed    an   aggravated   assault   [or   aggravated   battery]\\n\\nindependent of the act that caused the victim’s death,” the trial\\n\\ncourt erred in failing to merge for sentencing purposes Counts 7 and\\n\\n9 with Count 1.

See Willis,\\n\\n304 Ga. at 692\\n (2) (holding that, where the medical examiner\\n\\ntestified that “any one of the wounds would have caused [the\\n\\nvictim’s] death,” separate convictions for aggravated assault and\\n\\nmalice murder were not authorized); Alvelo v.

IN THE MATTER OF PAUL JASON YORK.\\n\\n        PER CURIAM.\\n\\n        This disciplinary matter is before the Court on the report and\\n\\nrecommendation of Special Master Michael J. Blakely, who\\n\\nrecommends that the Court accept the petition for voluntary\\n\\ndiscipline filed by Respondent Paul Jason York (State Bar No.\\n\\n929158) after the filing of a formal complaint, see Bar Rule 4-227 (c),\\n\\nand impose a three-year suspension with conditions, nunc pro tunc\\n\\nto May 1, 2020. In his petition, York, a member of the State Bar of\\n\\nGeorgia since 2014, admitted to violating Rules 1.7 (a), 3.3 (a), 4.1,\\n\\nand 8.4 (a) (4) of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct\\n\\n(“GRPC”), found in Bar Rule 4-102 (d). The maximum sanction for a\\n\\nsingle violation of any of these Rules is disbarment. Neither York\\n\\nnor the Bar filed exceptions in this Court to the Special Master’s\\n report and recommendation. For the reasons discussed below, we\\n\\nreject York’s petition for voluntary discipline.\\n\\n     After the Bar filed a formal complaint, York filed a petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline admitting the allegations against him. A\\n\\ndisciplinary hearing was held on June 16, 2023. In his report, the\\n\\nSpecial Master recounted that York admitted the following facts. In\\n\\nearly 2020, York represented a client who was arrested and charged\\n\\nwith misdemeanor family violence against her husband. She was\\n\\nreleased on bond on the condition that she not contact her husband,\\n\\nbut she was arrested a second time based on an allegation that she\\n\\nhad violated the no-contact condition. Thereafter, she was again\\n\\nreleased on bond with the added conditions that she wear an\\n\\nelectronic monitoring device on her ankle and pay a monthly\\n\\nmonitoring fee of $347.52.\\n\\n     York forged the signatures of a judge and an assistant district\\n\\nattorney on a court order dated March 4, 2020 that purportedly\\n\\nauthorized the removal of the monitoring device from the client’s\\n\\nankle. As a result, he was charged with felony forgery, and he\\n\\n                                   2\\n entered into a 36-month Pretrial Diversion Agreement (“PDA”) with\\n\\nthe district attorney’s office pursuant to OCGA § 15-18-80,1\\n\\nrequiring him, for the duration of the PDA, to (1) refrain from drug\\n\\nand alcohol use; (2) submit to random drug tests; (3) continue\\n\\ncounseling with a psychologist until released; (4) continue\\n\\ncounseling with a substance abuse counselor until released; (5)\\n\\nattend at least one weekly drug/alcohol support group meeting; (6)\\n\\nattend monthly legal mentoring sessions; (7) follow the Bar’s\\n\\nrecommendations; and (8) “not practice law until reinstated by the\\n\\nState Bar of Georgia.”2 The district attorney agreed to dismiss the\\n\\ncriminal charges upon York’s completion of the conditions, but if\\n\\nYork failed to meet those conditions, he could face prosecution.3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     1 A PDA provides “an alternative to prosecuting offenders in the criminal\\n\\njustice system.” OCGA §15-18-80 (b). The Special Master observed that, as a\\nresult of the PDA, the trial court has not entered judgment against or imposed\\na criminal sentence on York.\\n     2 The Special Master found that York voluntarily stopped practicing law\\n\\nin May 2020, about two months after he committed the forgery.\\n     3 The transcript of the disciplinary hearing before the Special Master\\n\\nreflects that York testified that he entered into the PDA on August 8, 2022,\\nand he believes that it will remain in effect until at least August 8, 2025.\\n\\n                                      3\\n      The Special Master observed that York committed the\\n\\nmisconduct at issue here in response to pressure from the client, her\\n\\nfamily and friends, and members of her church to procure the\\n\\nremoval of the monitoring device because the monthly fee caused the\\n\\nclient financial hardship. Moreover, York suffered from serious\\n\\nsubstance abuse and psychological problems at the time he\\n\\ncommitted the misconduct. However, York presented evidence that\\n\\nhe sought and received care from a psychologist, who evaluated him\\n\\nin December 2020 and conducted a follow-up evaluation in\\n\\nSeptember 2021; successfully completed an intensive outpatient\\n\\nprogram; and began to attend weekly counseling sessions with a\\n\\nsubstance abuse counselor. The psychologist opined at the\\n\\ndisciplinary hearing that York’s judgment and mental and\\n\\nemotional functioning had been impaired by his drug addiction,\\n\\nclinical depression, and anxiety, which caused or contributed to his\\n\\nacts of forgery, but as a result of treatment, York was in a state of\\n\\nrecovery and could safely practice law. The Special Master also\\n\\nobserved that evidence was presented that York is mentored by a\\n\\n                                 4\\n state court judge, who believes that York is ready to resume his legal\\n\\ncareer.\\n\\n      The Special Master concluded that York’s admissions in his\\n\\npetition were sufficient to establish violations of Rules 1.7 (a),4 3.3\\n\\n(a),5 4.1,6 and 8.4 (a) (4).7 The Special Master then considered the\\n\\nABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (“ABA Standards”),\\n\\nwhich include (1) the duty violated; (2) the lawyer’s mental state; (3)\\n\\nthe actual or potential injury caused by the misconduct; and (4)\\n\\naggravating or mitigating factors. See In the Matter of Morse, \\n266\\n\\nGa. 652\\n, 653 (\\n470 SE2d 232\\n) (1996). The Special Master observed\\n\\nthat York violated his duty to the legal system by engaging in\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Rule 1.7 (a) provides that “[a] lawyer shall not represent or continue to\\n\\nrepresent a client if there is a significant risk that the lawyer’s own interests\\nor the lawyer’s duties to another client, a former client, or a third person will\\nmaterially and adversely affect the representation of the client[.]”\\n      5Rule 3.3 (a) provides in relevant part that “[a] lawyer shall not\\nknowingly: (1) make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal[.]”\\n      6 Rule 4.1 (a) provides that “[i]n the course of representing a client a\\n\\nlawyer shall not knowingly: make a false statement of material fact or law to\\na third person[.]”\\n      7 Rule 8.4 (a) (4) provides that it is a violation of the GRPC for a lawyer\\n\\nto “engage in professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\\nmisrepresentation.”\\n\\n                                       5\\n deceptive conduct (i.e., forgery) during legal proceedings, see ABA\\n\\nStandard 6.0; that he did so intentionally; and that his misconduct\\n\\ncaused actual injury to the legal system, the judge, and the assistant\\n\\ndistrict attorney, and potential harm to the client’s criminal case,\\n\\nthough it did not appear that the unapproved removal of the\\n\\nmonitoring device caused the client’s case any actual harm. The\\n\\npresumptive sanction for this type of misconduct is disbarment. See\\n\\nABA Standard 6.11 (disbarment appropriate when lawyer, with\\n\\nintent to deceive a court, makes false statements or submits false\\n\\ndocument and causes serious injury).\\n\\n     In aggravation, the Special Master found that the forgery was\\n\\ndishonest, but noted that York sought no economic benefit for\\n\\nhimself, see ABA Standard 9.22 (b); that he admitted to multiple\\n\\nviolations of the Rules, see ABA Standard 9.22 (d); that he had\\n\\nsubstantial experience in the practice of law, see ABA Standard 9.22\\n\\n(i), because he had been practicing for six years at the time of the\\n\\nmisconduct; and that he had committed illegal conduct, see ABA\\n\\nStandard 9.22 (k).\\n\\n                                  6\\n       In mitigation, the Special Master found the absence of a prior\\n\\ndisciplinary record, see ABA Standard 9.32 (a); full and free\\n\\ndisclosure to the disciplinary board or a cooperative attitude toward\\n\\nproceedings, see ABA Standard 9.32 (e); evidence of good character\\n\\nand reputation in the form of letters attesting to York’s provision of\\n\\npro bono legal assistance in his community, see ABA Standard 9.32\\n\\n(g); imposition of other penalties or sanctions due to York’s criminal\\n\\ncharges, see ABA Standard 9.32 (k)8; and remorse, see ABA\\n\\nStandard 9.32 (l). The Special Master also gave significant\\n\\nmitigating weight to York’s personal or emotional problems, see\\n\\nABA Standard 9.32 (c), because a psychologist had diagnosed him\\n\\nwith ADHD and observed that “cognitive impairment (related to\\n\\ndrug use, depression, anxiety, and burn out) played a major part in\\n\\nhis poor judgment” leading to his misconduct. Finally, the Special\\n\\n\\n\\n      8 We disagree with the Special Master’s application of ABA Standard\\n\\n9.32 (k) because we have held that the imposition of a criminal penalty relating\\nto the same conduct at issue in a disciplinary matter should not be viewed as\\na mitigating factor. See In the Matter of Levin, \\n289 Ga. 170\\n, 175 (\\n709 SE2d 808\\n)\\n(2011), citing In the Matter of Ortman, \\n289 Ga. 130\\n, 131-132 (\\n709 SE2d 784\\n)\\n(2011) (Nahmias, J., concurring).\\n\\n                                       7\\n Master gave significant weight to the mitigating factor of “mental\\n\\ndisability or substance abuse problem,” see ABA Standard 9.32 (i),9\\n\\nbecause although York suffered from drug abuse and psychological\\n\\nproblems at the time of his misconduct, he had shown significant\\n\\nevidence of recovery. Specifically, the Special Master recited that in\\n\\nhis 2020 evaluation, the psychologist found that at the time of his\\n\\nmisconduct, York was abusing his ADHD medications and\\n\\nmethamphetamine, which “likely caused him to be adept at\\n\\ndishonesty, shading the truth and covering up mistakes and\\n\\nwrongdoing.” However, in his 2021 evaluation, the psychologist\\n\\nnoted that York “has been very involved in a milieu of treatments to\\n\\n\\n\\n     9 ABA Standard 9.32 (i) provides that an attorney’s “mental disability or\\n\\nchemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse” can be considered\\nmitigating when\\n     (1) there is medical evidence that the respondent is affected by a\\n     chemical dependency or mental disability;\\n     (2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the\\n     misconduct;\\n     (3) the respondent’s recovery from the chemical dependency or\\n     mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained\\n     period of successful rehabilitation; and\\n     (4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of that\\n     misconduct is unlikely.\\n\\n                                     8\\n improve his health and functioning”; that his mood and cognitive\\n\\nfunctioning had improved; that he had not relapsed; and that his\\n\\n“drug/alcohol problems are in remission.”\\n\\n     The Special Master observed that in Georgia, an attorney’s\\n\\nsubmission of fabricated documents is a serious offense that may\\n\\njustify disbarment. Cf. In the Matter of Manning-Wallace, \\n287 Ga.\\n\\n223\\n, 224 (\\n695 SE2d 237\\n) (2010) (Nahmias, J. concurring). However,\\n\\nmitigating factors may support a suspension even where the offense\\n\\nwould justify disbarment, such as an attorney’s demonstration of a\\n\\nsustained recovery from the substance abuse that led to his\\n\\nmisconduct. See In the Matter of Adams, \\n291 Ga. 173\\n (\\n729 SE2d 313\\n)\\n\\n(2012) (accepting petition for voluntary discipline and imposing\\n\\npublic reprimand, on special master’s recommendation, for attorney\\n\\nwho violated numerous provisions of the GRPC, but showed that his\\n\\nmisconduct was caused in part by substance abuse, from which he\\n\\nhad undergone significant rehabilitation and was maintaining his\\n\\nrecovery); In the Matter of Jaconetti, \\n291 Ga. 772\\n (\\n732 SE2d 447\\n)\\n\\n(2012) (attorney’s misconduct was mitigated by the fact that it was\\n\\n                                 9\\n likely attributable to his mental illness and severe emotional\\n\\ndistress; three-year suspension for multiple violations, including\\n\\nRule 8.4 (a) (4)). The Special Master noted that York had\\n\\ndemonstrated significant mitigating factors, and he had taken\\n\\nconcrete steps to overcome his substance abuse problem and address\\n\\nhis psychological issues, resulting in improved cognitive functioning\\n\\nand a “remission” of his addiction.\\n\\n     To be sure, the Special Master acknowledged that in Manning-\\n\\nWallace, this Court rejected an attorney’s petition for voluntary\\n\\ndiscipline requesting a Review Panel reprimand when the attorney\\n\\noffered fabricated insurance documents into evidence in a case on\\n\\nher own behalf, rather than on behalf of a client; moreover, she\\n\\ninitially denied that the documents had been fabricated or that she\\n\\nhad offered them into evidence. Id. at 224. See also In the Matter of\\n\\nDogan, \\n282 Ga. 783\\n (\\n653 SE2d 690\\n) (2007) (disbarring attorney who\\n\\nproduced fabricated pay stubs in child support case against him,\\n\\nwith the intent to deceive the other party; no mitigating factors). But\\n\\nthe Special Master attempted to distinguish the facts of this case by\\n\\n                                  10\\n noting that York submitted the forged order on behalf of his client,\\n\\nnot himself; he did not attempt to mislead the Bar or the Special\\n\\nMaster; he admitted to the factual allegations and Rule violations;\\n\\nand there were significant mitigating factors. The Special Master\\n\\nopined that although York forged the signatures with the intent to\\n\\ndeceive, his only possible selfish motivation would have been to\\n\\nrelieve himself of the pressure from his client and her supporters.\\n\\nThe Special Master stated that in forging the signatures, York was\\n\\nnot seeking financial gain; he was not consciously seeking to harm\\n\\nanyone; and he acknowledged the harmful nature of his conduct.\\n\\n     The Special Master thus recommended that the Court accept\\n\\nYork’s petition and impose a three-year suspension with the\\n\\nfollowing conditions during the suspension: (1) compliance with the\\n\\nterms of the PDA; (2) attending counseling with the psychologist and\\n\\nwith the substance abuse counselor, weekly support group meetings,\\n\\nand monthly legal mentoring meetings; and (3) as preconditions to\\n\\nreinstatement, (a) obtaining a certification from a medical doctor or\\n\\npsychologist that he is fit to practice law and that his emotional and\\n\\n                                 11\\n substance abuse problems have been addressed, (b) providing proof\\n\\nthat he is in compliance with the PDA, and (c) providing proof that\\n\\nhe complied with his obligations to attend counseling and support\\n\\nmeetings pursuant to the second condition. Moreover, the Special\\n\\nMaster noted that if York is convicted of a crime arising from the\\n\\nsame facts as this disciplinary matter, the Bar may seek all\\n\\ndisciplinary sanctions authorized by the Bar Rules, including\\n\\ndisbarment. The Special Master concluded that, subject to York’s\\n\\ncompliance with the conditions for reinstatement, it would be\\n\\nappropriate for the suspension to be imposed nunc pro tunc to May\\n\\n1, 2020, the date York stopped practicing law, because York provided\\n\\na letter from his former law partner (who is also his father)\\n\\nregarding his efforts to withdraw from all of his cases by May 2020,\\n\\nand a letter from the clerk of court in the county where he primarily\\n\\npracticed indicating that he had not filed any court documents since\\n\\nMay 2020. See In the Matter of Onipede, \\n288 Ga. 156\\n, 157 (\\n702 SE2d\\n\\n136\\n) (2010) (“[W]hen an attorney requests [discipline] nunc pro tunc,\\n\\nit is the lawyer’s responsibility to demonstrate that [he] voluntarily\\n\\n                                 12\\n stopped practicing law, the date on which [his] law practice ended,\\n\\nand that [he] complied with all the ethical obligations implicated in\\n\\nsuch a decision, such as assisting clients in securing new counsel\\n\\nand facilitating the transfer of client files and critical information\\n\\nabout ongoing cases to new counsel.”).\\n\\n     We commend the Special Master for his thorough analysis of\\n\\nthe facts and issues in this case. We disagree, however, with the\\n\\nrecommendation to accept York’s petition while his criminal forgery\\n\\ncharges remain pending. Although we recognize that a pretrial\\n\\ndiversion agreement is considered an “alternative to prosecution,”\\n\\nsee OCGA § 15-18-80 (b), the prosecution remains open during the\\n\\npendency of the PDA, and York has admitted that his PDA will not\\n\\nexpire until at least August 8, 2025, see n.3, supra. If we were to\\n\\naccept York’s petition, he would be eligible to have his three-year\\n\\nsuspension imposed nunc pro tunc to May 1, 2020, the date on which\\n\\nhe offered evidence that he stopped practicing law, and he would be\\n\\neligible for reinstatement because more than three years have\\n\\npassed since that date. But if he were permitted to resume practicing\\n\\n                                 13\\n law before the PDA expires, “the public is likely to lose respect for\\n\\nthe legal system,” just as it would if an attorney were permitted to\\n\\nresume the practice of law while serving criminal probation. In the\\n\\nMatter of Paine, \\n280 Ga. 208\\n, 210 (\\n625 SE2d 768\\n) (2006). The same\\n\\nreasoning applies when felony charges remain pending, albeit under\\n\\na pretrial diversion agreement.\\n\\n     Moreover, we have previously found it appropriate to impose\\n\\nan interim or emergency suspension on an attorney pending the\\n\\nresolution of his or her felony charges. See, e.g., In the Matter of\\n\\nMorris, \\n298 Ga. 864\\n, 864-865 (\\n785 SE2d 4087\\n) (2016) (granting\\n\\nattorney’s voluntary petition for emergency suspension pending the\\n\\nresolution of his disciplinary and criminal matters); In the Matter of\\n\\nSmith, \\n297 Ga. 46\\n, 46 (\\n771 SE2d 901\\n) (2015) (granting attorney’s\\n\\npetition for indefinite suspension pending the outcome of felony\\n\\ntheft by conversion and forgery charges arising from attorney’s\\n\\nrepresentation of civil clients; State Bar observed that attorney’s\\n\\nrequest “strikes a reasonable balance between the need for public\\n\\nprotection and [attorney’s] right to defend against the criminal\\n\\n                                  14\\n charges”); In the Matter of Galette, \\n292 Ga. 341\\n (\\n737 SE2d 691\\n)\\n\\n(2013) (granting attorney’s request for suspension of license pending\\n\\nthe resolution of criminal charges, the underlying facts of which\\n\\nwere related to a grievance filed with the State Bar by the attorney’s\\n\\nclient); In the Matter of Swank, \\n288 Ga. 479\\n (\\n704 SE2d 807\\n) (2011)\\n\\n(granting lawyer’s voluntary petition for a suspension pending the\\n\\nresolution of his felony criminal charges). Although York voluntarily\\n\\nceased practicing law, thereby obviating a need for the Bar to seek\\n\\nan emergency suspension, a similar rationale in protecting the\\n\\npublic applies to not permitting York to resume practicing law while\\n\\nthe charges remain unresolved.\\n\\n     For these reasons, we conclude that York’s proposed discipline\\n\\nis insufficient because it would be inappropriate to impose his\\n\\nrequested three-year suspension nunc pro tunc under the\\n\\ncircumstances of this case. Accordingly, we reject York’s petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline. See generally In the Matter of Veach, \\n310 Ga.\\n\\n470\\n, 472 (\\n851 SE2d 590\\n) (2020) (noting Court’s practice, when\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 15\\n finding proposed discipline insufficient, of rejecting a petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline rather than imposing a greater sanction).\\n\\n     Petition for voluntary discipline rejected.

SCHMITT v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n        Bryan Keith Schmitt challenges his malice murder conviction\\n\\nfor the death of Hamid Jahangard, who died after being hit by\\n\\nSchmitt’s car. 1 On appeal, Schmitt argues that the trial court\\n\\ncommitted reversible error by denying his request to instruct the\\n\\njury on the defense of accident as to all counts. We conclude that the\\n\\ntrial court erred because at least slight evidence supported that\\n\\n\\n        1 The collision in question occurred on July 30, 2019. A Fulton County\\n\\ngrand jury indicted Schmitt on August 23, 2019, and reindicted him on October\\n8, 2021, charging him with malice murder (Count 1), two counts of felony\\nmurder (Counts 2-3), and two counts of aggravated assault (Counts 4-5). At\\ntrial in September 2022, the jury found Schmitt guilty of all five counts. The\\ntrial court sentenced Schmitt to serve life in prison with the possibility of\\nparole for malice murder and merged the aggravated assault counts with the\\nmalice murder count, and the felony murder counts were vacated by operation\\nof law. Schmitt timely moved for a new trial. On May 16, 2023, the trial court\\nentered an order denying that motion. Schmitt filed a timely notice of appeal,\\nand the case was docketed to the December 2023 term of this Court and orally\\nargued on January 9, 2024.\\n charge. Because the State has not carried its burden to show that it\\n\\nis highly probable that this error did not contribute to the verdict,\\n\\nwe reverse Schmitt’s conviction. And because the trial court also\\n\\nerred in declining the accident instruction as to the related counts\\n\\nof felony murder and aggravated assault, the verdicts on those\\n\\ncounts cannot stand. But the evidence was legally sufficient to\\n\\nsustain Schmitt’s conviction, and so the State may retry him.2\\n\\n      The evidence at trial, including video recordings played for the\\n\\njury, showed the following. 3 On July 30, 2019, Schmitt was driving\\n\\nhis regular commute home from work through a residential area\\n\\nwhen he saw Jahangard standing by the road. Jahangard made a\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Schmitt also asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by\\ndenying his motion to exclude State expert testimony that the evidence was\\ninconsistent with an accidental motor vehicle collision, erred by denying his\\nrequest to charge either of the lesser offenses of “unlawful act” and “unlawful\\nmanner” involuntary manslaughter, and erred by overruling his motion under\\nNapue v. Illinois, \\n360 U.S. 264\\n (79 SCt 1173) (1959). Because we reverse and\\nthese alleged errors are unlikely to occur again if the State retries him, we do\\nnot address them. See Heard v. State, \\n309 Ga. 76\\n, 83 (2) n.10 (\\n884 SE2d 791\\n)\\n(2020).\\n      3 Because this case calls us to consider whether the trial court’s error was\\n\\nharmless, we recount the evidence reasonably and in detail and weigh the\\nevidence as we would expect reasonable jurors to have done, as opposed to\\nviewing it solely in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdicts. See Moore v.\\nState, \\n315 Ga. 263\\n, 264 n.2 (1) (\\n882 SE2d 227\\n) (2022).\\n                                        2\\n bouncing or throwing motion with his arm. Schmitt heard a “very\\n\\nloud noise” and felt something slam into the front of his car, “hit [his]\\n\\nbrakes,” continued driving, turned around, and returned to where\\n\\nhe saw Jahangard standing near trashcans in a driveway. Schmitt\\n\\nstopped his car in the right lane, with a lane separating him from\\n\\nJahangard on the left, and rolled his window down. They argued\\n\\nacross traffic as cars passed Schmitt’s stopped car.\\n\\n      The nature of the argument is unclear. At trial, Schmitt\\n\\ntestified that he was leery about pulling into the driveway\\n\\nimmediately, as he “didn’t know who this was or what the situation\\n\\nmight have been.” He testified that he asked whether Jahangard\\n\\n“thr[e]w a golf ball or what happened[,]” and Jahangard yelled in\\n\\nresponse — in a dismissive and loud voice — for him to “get the f**k\\n\\nout of here.” In contrast, Jahangard’s brother, Manoucher\\n\\nJahangard, testified that he and Jahangard were talking on the\\n\\nphone 4 when someone talking in a “very loud and fast and angry”\\n\\n\\n      4  Manoucher testified that his phone showed that he or Jahangard\\ninitiated the call at 5:37 p.m. The State played for the jury a time-stamped\\nvideo of the collision that appears to show Jahangard on the phone at this time.\\n                                       3\\n manner 5    interrupted      their   conversation.      Manoucher       heard\\n\\nJahangard sound “very surprised” and repeat three times, “I didn’t\\n\\nthrow anything to you, sir[,]” but the yelling continued. After\\n\\nJahangard repeated for the third time, “I didn’t throw anything to\\n\\nyou, sir[,]” Manoucher heard “a bunch of noise” and Jahangard say\\n\\n“[g]et away from my face,” but then the phone disconnected. 6\\n\\n      During this argument, Schmitt decided to turn left into the\\n\\ndriveway and accelerated his car to between fifteen and sixteen\\n\\nmiles per hour. During that turn, Schmitt’s brake light came on at\\n\\nleast once, 7 and he began to veer his car away from Jahangard to the\\n\\nright. Schmitt’s car struck Jahangard.8\\n\\n\\n\\n      5   On cross-examination, Schmitt’s counsel attempted to elicit\\nManoucher’s agreement that the words “angry” and “aggressive” did not\\nappear in the transcript of his initial interview, and he ultimately responded,\\n“[m]aybe not.”\\n       6 Manoucher testified that, at the time, Jahangard was waiting in the\\n\\ndriveway to direct painters to his rental property. Manoucher was “very\\nworried because of the conversation,” so he left immediately to check on\\nJahangard.\\n       7 Despite using the same video surveillance footage, the State’s expert\\n\\nand Schmitt’s expert disputed the exact moment that Schmitt hit his brakes.\\nThis video surveillance footage was played several times for the jury. Schmitt\\nalso testified that he hit the brakes before colliding with Jahangard.\\n       8 Hours later, after Jahangard’s family realized that Jahangard’s cell\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      4\\n      Jahangard immediately fell to the driveway, hit his head, and\\n\\nbegan bleeding. Schmitt put his car in park and, without turning it\\n\\noff, exited to render aid. Schmitt kneeled next to Jahangard and\\n\\nstabilized his head while awaiting paramedics. Jahangard died days\\n\\nlater, and the autopsy revealed the cause of death as “blunt force\\n\\ninjuries of the head due to a motor vehicle collision, car versus\\n\\npedestrian.”\\n\\n     At trial, Schmitt testified in his own defense, denied using the\\n\\ncar as a weapon, and denied intentionally striking Jahangard.\\n\\nSchmitt testified that he turned into the driveway “to try to sort out\\n\\nwhat happened and to see if there was any damage to [his] car.” He\\n\\nknew that he was too far up the road to turn left, and he thought he\\n\\ncould make a U-turn to turn right into the driveway without\\n\\nimpacting Jahangard, but he misjudged the turning radius of his\\n\\ncar.9 As he turned, Schmitt checked oncoming traffic, his rearview\\n\\n\\n\\nphone was missing, Jahangard’s phone was tracked to Schmitt’s home address.\\nAn officer found the phone, after having someone call it, stuck under the\\nwindshield wiper of Schmitt’s car with a “completely shattered” front screen.\\n     9 During cross-examination, the State elicited that at the time of the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     5\\n mirror, and his side mirror, losing his focus on Jahangard. When he\\n\\nrealized the trashcans were directly in front of him, he instinctively\\n\\ncut his wheel to the right and hit the brakes to miss them. Schmitt\\n\\ntestified that, upon hitting Jahangard, his military medical training\\n\\ntook over and he immediately began to render aid.10 Throughout his\\n\\ntestimony, he referred to the collision as an accident, and he insisted\\n\\nthat he did not intend to harm, hurt, scare, intimidate, or kill\\n\\nJahangard. He testified that he “was trying to avoid an accident”\\n\\nand “was trying to de-escalate the situation.”\\n\\n      Both parties’ experts acknowledged that the steering wheel\\n\\nwas turned to the right before the collision, which kept the center of\\n\\nthe car from striking Jahangard, 11 Schmitt’s expert specifically\\n\\ntestified that the front left corner of Schmitt’s car struck Jahangard,\\n\\nand the State’s expert conceded that only a few inches — “the very\\n\\n\\n\\ncollision Schmitt had been driving for about thirty years and had driven the\\ncar that hit Jahangard for six years.\\n       10 Schmitt testified that medical training was a “critical part of military\\n\\ntraining” and was included as “part of the regular training” that he received\\nduring his years serving in the military.\\n       11 The State’s expert also testified that if the wheel had been turned more\\n\\nto the right, Schmitt may have altogether avoided contact with Jahangard.\\n                                        6\\n left edge” — of the car struck Jahangard. The experts also opined\\n\\nthat once Schmitt began his turn, a collision was inevitable. The\\n\\nState’s expert opined that a black stain on Jahangard’s pants, which\\n\\nwere in evidence, was caused by a tire transfer, meaning that the\\n\\ncar’s front tire rolled over Jahangard’s left foot and ankle, and that\\n\\nthe car’s rear tire rolled over his knee. Schmitt’s expert opined that\\n\\nthe car did not run over Jahangard’s leg, as the GBI investigative\\n\\nreport did not reveal automotive paint, plastic, or grease on\\n\\nJahangard’s clothes and based on the expert’s review of a video of\\n\\nthe collision.\\n\\n     Several witnesses also testified at trial. Donald Utroska, Jr.,\\n\\ntestified that he was driving when “all of a sudden” he saw “garbage\\n\\ncans and a car” move “swiftly” into the driveway. The car moved into\\n\\nthe driveway “awfully fast” and sent “very tall garbage cans in the\\n\\nair a good three to four feet.” Utroska pulled over when he saw\\n\\nJahangard on the driveway with pooling blood, and Schmitt asked\\n\\nhim to call 911. He also testified that Schmitt explained that\\n\\nJahangard threw a golf ball at his car, Schmitt and Jahangard\\n\\n                                  7\\n argued, and when Schmitt pulled over to discuss it, Jahangard\\n\\njumped in front of his car. After paramedics arrived, Utroska offered\\n\\nhis contact information to Schmitt and found it “a little strange” that\\n\\nSchmitt declined. Utroska described Schmitt’s demeanor as “very\\n\\nemotionless, very plain[,]” and “nonchalant.”\\n\\n     Jessica Woodsen testified that she lived across the street from\\n\\nwhere the collision occurred and her security camera recorded the\\n\\ncollision. Though she did not see the collision, she saw out of her\\n\\nwindow two men standing and one man lying on the driveway across\\n\\nthe street. She described the man in the driveway as “laid out,”\\n\\nunmoving, with his eyes open, with blood coming from his head, and\\n\\nwith his left leg hyperextended at the knee. When she arrived, the\\n\\ncar was still running and Schmitt was attempting to render aid to\\n\\nJahangard. She reprimanded Schmitt for attempting to move\\n\\nJahangard’s leg, which was under the back bumper and behind the\\n\\ndriver’s side back wheel. Woodsen testified that, when asked what\\n\\nhappened, Schmitt told her that Jahangard was walking, yelled\\n\\nsomething, and threw something at his car. When Schmitt turned in\\n\\n                                  8\\n the driveway to see what happened, Jahangard pushed a trashcan\\n\\nonto his car, and the trashcan bounced off of Schmitt’s car and\\n\\nknocked Jahangard over. Woodsen described Schmitt’s demeanor as\\n\\n“a little defensive” and as not giving the impression that he was\\n\\nconcerned about Jahangard.\\n\\n     Mokraine Lhocine testified that he was driving a company van\\n\\nthat contained a dashcam that recorded the collision. Lhocine saw a\\n\\nstopped car in the middle of the road with cars passing it, then the\\n\\ncar made a “quick” turn and hit trashcans. As Lhocine continued\\n\\ndown the road, he saw that the door of the car was open, the driver\\n\\nwas holding somebody on the ground, and “there was a lot of blood\\n\\naround him.”\\n\\n     Captain   Jeremiah    Green     of   the   Sandy   Springs   Fire\\n\\nDepartment testified that, when he arrived, Schmitt was kneeling\\n\\nbeside Jahangard and focused on holding Jahangard’s neck in a way\\n\\nthat protected the spine from further injury. Schmitt told Captain\\n\\nGreen that he did not know what happened or remember if\\n\\nJahangard was hit. Schmitt “mentioned something about a golf ball,\\n\\n                                 9\\n and he mentioned that the patient was yelling at him.”\\n\\n      James Durden, a paramedic, testified that when he arrived\\n\\nJahangard was unconscious but breathing spontaneously, lying on\\n\\nhis back with a significant amount of blood coming from the back of\\n\\nhis head and ears, with possible hyperextension to his left leg.\\n\\nSchmitt did not remember whether Jahangard “went up and over or\\n\\nunderneath” the car, and Durden was “a little struck that there\\n\\nwasn’t more emotion or concern[.]”\\n\\n      Police arrived around 40 minutes after the collision, and it had\\n\\nstarted raining. 12 By that point, firefighters had moved the trash\\n\\ncans, Schmitt had been permitted to move his vehicle, the rain\\n\\nwashed “[n]inety-nine percent of the blood away[,]” and a moving\\n\\nvan had driven through the driveway. Police officers nevertheless\\n\\nphotographed the scene, a golf ball found in a neighbor’s yard, and\\n\\nSchmitt’s car. Police permitted Schmitt to drive the car home. The\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      12 Schmitt’s counsel elicited law enforcement testimony that, despite this\\n\\ndelay, Schmitt remained voluntarily on the scene for an additional 30 to 40\\nminutes after police arrived while he was interviewed by police twice and wrote\\na statement, before being dismissed by police.\\n                                      10\\n lead detective testified that when police ultimately seized Schmitt’s\\n\\nvehicle pursuant to a warrant several days later, there was no fiber,\\n\\nhair, clothes, or anything of evidentiary value found.\\n\\n     Two video recordings of the collision were played for the jury:\\n\\nWoodsen’s security video and the company van’s dashcam video.\\n\\nThe State also played body camera footage from the police officer\\n\\nwho responded to the scene. As captured in that recording, Schmitt\\n\\ndescribed that Jahangard pushed a trash can in front of his car as\\n\\nhe began to make a U-turn, Schmitt swerved to miss it, and the\\n\\ntrash can hit the corner of his car and bumped Jahangard, who lost\\n\\nhis footing and fell. The State also presented Schmitt’s written\\n\\nstatement, which consisted of a similar narrative.\\n\\n     1. Schmitt argues that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\nrequest to instruct the jury on accident as a defense to malice\\n\\nmurder and that this error was not harmless. We agree.\\n\\n     Schmitt timely requested a jury instruction on the defense of\\n\\naccident and contended that the evidence supported that charge.\\n\\nAlthough the trial court indicated initially that it was proper to\\n\\n                                 11\\n instruct the jury on the defense of accident, it changed its position\\n\\nseveral times and ultimately rejected this instruction as to all\\n\\ncounts.13\\n\\n      Hours after the charge conference, in his closing argument,\\n\\nSchmitt presented a slide labeled “KEY LEGAL PRINCIPLES” that\\n\\nstated, “ACCIDENT: IF THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT, AND THERE\\n\\nWAS NO CRIMINAL INTENT, THIS WAS NOT A CRIME.” The\\n\\nState objected “based on the slide and that this is a legal principle.”\\n\\nThe State continued, “This is not a principle applicable to this case\\n\\nand not a charge of the Court.” The court sent the jury out to discuss\\n\\nwith the parties. The trial court directed Schmitt that, although the\\n\\ncourt rejected the accident charge, Schmitt could “argue that it was\\n\\nunintentional” — in other words, Schmitt could argue that he lacked\\n\\nthe necessary intent. The trial court eventually brought back the\\n\\n\\n\\n      13 The trial court opined, “[t]his is all going to turn on whether or not\\n\\naccident refers to . . . whether or not the movement of the car is intentional or\\nnot, notwithstanding the result of what happened and a suggestion that the\\nevidence — some parts of the evidence are that the result was unintended, but\\nthe turn and the movement of the vehicle clearly was intended, and so I think\\nit comes down to that.” The trial court distinguished between the “use of\\naccident as we use it as human beings” and the legal definition of accident.\\n                                       12\\n jury, sustained the State’s objection, and instructed the jury:\\n\\n     to disregard the statement offered by the defense counsel;\\n     in particular, that “accident” is a key legal principle that\\n     is a part of this case because it is not. It was therefore\\n     improper for defense counsel to display a slide designated\\n     Key Legal Principles with the word “accident” below it.\\n\\n     Schmitt continued his closing argument and insisted that\\n\\n“[t]his was an accident” and that, “[i]f this was an accident, if there\\n\\nwas no criminal intent, then it’s not a crime.” The trial court\\n\\ninstructed the jury on the presumption of innocence, the burden of\\n\\nproof, the definition of intent, the definition of malice, and that\\n\\nmalice could be express, implied, or both. During deliberations, the\\n\\njury requested a copy of Black’s Law Dictionary “for [a] definition of\\n\\nabandoned and malignant heart[,]” to view the PowerPoint\\n\\npresentations used by the parties in closing argument, and a\\n\\ntranscript of closing arguments. The trial court denied each of these\\n\\nrequests and instructed the jury to rely on the law as charged.\\n\\n     (a)   The trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on\\n           accident as a defense to malice murder.\\n\\n     “[The] accident defense applies where the evidence negates the\\n\\n\\n                                  13\\n defendant’s criminal intent, whatever that intent element is for the\\n\\ncrime at issue.” State v. Ogilvie, \\n292 Ga. 6\\n, 9 (2) (b) (\\n734 SE2d 50\\n)\\n\\n(2012). In the context of malice murder, that means that an accident\\n\\ndefense is available when there is evidence that the defendant\\n\\ncaused another’s death but acted without an express or implied\\n\\nintent to commit an unlawful homicide. See \\nid. at 10\\n (2) (c); OCGA §\\n\\n16-5-1; Taylor v. State, \\n303 Ga. 624\\n, 626 (1) (\\n814 SE2d 353\\n) (2018)\\n\\n(defining intent requirement for malice murder).\\n\\n     “[T]o authorize a requested jury instruction, there need only be\\n\\nslight evidence supporting the theory of the charge[.]” Wainwright\\n\\nv. State, \\n305 Ga. 63\\n, 70 (5) (a) (\\n823 SE2d 749\\n) (2019) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). The State contends that slight evidence did\\n\\nnot support the accident instruction because, in the context of the\\n\\naffirmative defense of accident, this Court has held that a\\n\\ndefendant’s conclusory claims that the defendant “didn’t mean to do\\n\\nit” or that a particular act “was an accident” “are insufficient without\\n\\nmore to authorize a charge on accident.” Mann v. State, \\n307 Ga. 696\\n,\\n\\n699 (2) (a) (\\n838 SE2d 305\\n) (2020) (citation and punctuation omitted)\\n\\n                                  14\\n (holding that any error in failing to give requested accident\\n\\ninstruction was harmless, although defendant indicated he intended\\n\\nto throw the seven-year old victim on a bed rather than on the\\n\\nground, because evidence — including that the victim’s “devastating\\n\\ninjuries, including bruising to his genitals, bruising to his body,\\n\\nretinal hemorrhaging in both eyes, bleeding and swelling in the\\n\\nbrain, and ultimately brain death” resulted from the defendant’s\\n\\n“intentional acts of beating, squeezing, and throwing” the victim —\\n\\noverwhelmingly supported the jury’s finding that the defendant\\n\\nacted with malice)); see also Mills v. State, \\n287 Ga. 828\\n, 832 (4) (\\n700\\n\\nSE2d 544\\n) (2010) (holding the misuse of a firearm described by the\\n\\ndefendant showed a degree of culpability which constituted criminal\\n\\nnegligence such that the trial court did not err in refusing the\\n\\naccident instruction); McDade v. State, \\n270 Ga. 654\\n, 657 (5) (\\n513\\n\\nSE2d 733\\n) (1999) (holding that the trial court properly rejected\\n\\nrequest for accident instruction when defendant’s statements and\\n\\nversions of events either could not have resulted in victim’s fatal\\n\\ngunshot wound or did not show the absence of a criminal scheme,\\n\\n                                  15\\n undertaking, intention, or criminal negligence), disapproved of on\\n\\nother grounds by Clark v. State, \\n315 Ga. 423\\n, 435 (3) (b) n.16 (\\n883\\n\\nSE2d 317\\n) (2023).\\n\\n     But those decisions do not apply here. In each of those cases,\\n\\nevidence of intentionality was strong and there was no theory of\\n\\naccident that would not have necessarily constituted criminal\\n\\nnegligence. See Browner v. State, \\n296 Ga. 138\\n, 144 (4) (\\n765 SE2d\\n\\n348\\n) (2014) (defining criminal negligence as a “reckless and wanton\\n\\nnegligence of such a character as to show an utter disregard for the\\n\\nsafety of others who might reasonably be expected to be injured\\n\\nthereby”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     In comparison, the evidence supporting Schmitt’s theory of\\n\\naccident did not require a finding of criminal negligence. Instead,\\n\\nthe undisputed evidence showed that Schmitt turned his car left,\\n\\naccelerated his car to between 15 and 16 miles per hour, veered his\\n\\ncar to the right and away from Jahangard, at some point tapped his\\n\\nbrakes, and that the left edge of Schmitt’s car struck Jahangard.\\n\\nNothing about this necessarily shows any criminal negligence\\n\\n                                16\\n because Schmitt’s theory of accident does not rest on conduct which\\n\\nis itself a criminal act and because a rational juror could find from\\n\\nthe evidence that this was an accident. And so in this context,\\n\\nSchmitt’s testimony that the collision was an accident presented at\\n\\nleast slight evidence necessary to warrant an instruction on the\\n\\ndefense of accident.\\n\\n     The State argues that Schmitt acted with an utter disregard\\n\\nfor Jahangard’s safety (and thus criminal negligence) when he\\n\\naccelerated into the driveway with knowledge of Jahangard’s\\n\\nlocation. But this is a disputed issue, and there was other evidence\\n\\nthat a juror could find showed a lack of such criminal negligence.\\n\\nSchmitt testified that he turned into the driveway “to try to sort out\\n\\nwhat happened and to see if there was any damage to [his] car.”\\n\\nSchmitt denied using the car as a weapon, denied intending to\\n\\nintimidate Jahangard, and denied intentionally striking Jahangard.\\n\\nRather, Schmitt testified that he misjudged the turning radius of his\\n\\ncar, he lost his focus on Jahangard as he checked for traffic as he\\n\\nturned, he turned his car to the right — away from Jahangard —\\n\\n                                 17\\n before the collision, and he slammed on brakes. Moreover, Schmitt\\n\\nand his expert testified that his brake lights came on, went off, and\\n\\ncame back on before the collision; witnesses testified that Schmitt\\n\\nrendered immediate aid; video footage corroborated that he\\n\\nrendered immediate aid; both experts testified that Schmitt turned\\n\\nhis car to the right, away from Jahangard, before the collision; both\\n\\nexperts described that the front left corner of Schmitt’s car (rather\\n\\nthan the center of the car) hit Jahangard; and Schmitt’s expert\\n\\ntestified that a GBI investigative report revealed that there was no\\n\\nautomotive paint, plastic, or grease on Jahangard’s clothes.\\n\\n     Therefore, at least slight evidence supported that “there was\\n\\nno criminal scheme or undertaking, intention, or criminal\\n\\nnegligence,” and the trial court erred in declining the accident\\n\\ninstruction. OCGA § 16-2-2.\\n\\n     (b)   The trial court’s error was not harmless.\\n\\n     The State has failed to carry its burden to show that this error\\n\\nwas harmless. Evidence of Schmitt’s criminal intent was conflicting\\n\\nand far from overwhelming, and the harm from the trial court’s\\n\\n                                 18\\n failure to instruct the jury on the defense of accident was\\n\\ncompounded by the trial court’s express instruction that the jury\\n\\nmust “disregard” that accident was a key legal principle.\\n\\n     As an initial matter, it is well settled that “[t]he test for\\n\\ndetermining nonconstitutional harmless error is whether it is highly\\n\\nprobable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.” Jivens v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 859\\n, 863 (2) (\\n896 SE2d 516\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). For this analysis, “we review the record de\\n\\nnovo and weigh the evidence as we would expect reasonable jurors\\n\\nwould have done instead of viewing it in the light most favorable to\\n\\nthe jury’s verdict.” \\nId.\\n\\n\\n     The parties do not dispute that Schmitt caused Jahangard’s\\n\\ndeath when he turned his car into the driveway and his car collided\\n\\nwith Jahangard. Rather, the central question presented to the jury\\n\\nwas whether Schmitt acted with criminal intent. 14 And evidence as\\n\\n\\n     14 In his opening statement, Schmitt condensed the crux of his argument:\\n\\n     The one real dispute in this case, the one question that really\\n     matters, the key question that you, the jury, will have to answer\\n     when deciding the fate of Mr. Schmitt is this. What was Mr.\\n\\n                                    19\\n to this point was far from overwhelming.\\n\\n      The State contends that evidence of Schmitt’s conduct and\\n\\ndemeanor before, during, and after the collision presented evidence\\n\\nof his criminal intent — that he intended to kill Jahangard. See\\n\\nGuzman-Perez v. State, \\n310 Ga. 573\\n, 576-577 (1) (\\n853 SE2d 76\\n)\\n\\n(2020) (“[C]riminal intent is a question for the factfinder, and can be\\n\\ninferred from the defendant’s conduct before, during, and after the\\n\\ncommission of the crimes[.]”). Among other things, the State points\\n\\nto the argument before the collision, which was corroborated with\\n\\ntime-stamped video footage showing Jahangard on the phone at this\\n\\ntime and the fact that Jahangard’s phone was found hours later,\\n\\n“completely shattered,” under the car’s windshield wiper. The State\\n\\nelicited that Schmitt intended to return to where he saw Jahangard\\n\\nstanding, to turn left despite knowing Jahangard’s proximity to his\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Schmitt intending to do when he pulled in that driveway and made\\n      that turn?\\nSimilarly, in closing argument, the State explained to the jury that “[t]he\\nquestion is whether or not the defendant’s intentional actions, as demonstrated\\nby the evidence that’s been introduced here and by his own admissions, were\\ncriminal. Were they criminal? That is the dispute at issue. That’s it.”\\n                                      20\\n car, and to accelerate his car. The State pointed to expert testimony\\n\\nthat, once the turn began, the collision was inevitable. The State’s\\n\\nexpert further opined that the stain on Jahangard’s pants must have\\n\\ncome from tire transfer, the car’s front tire rolled over his knee and\\n\\nankle, the car’s rear tire rolled over his knee, and that evidence of\\n\\nthe injuries was inconsistent with an accidental collision. Witnesses\\n\\ndescribed how “awfully fast,” “all of a sudden,” and “quick” the car\\n\\nturned and sent “very tall garbage cans in the air a good three to\\n\\nfour feet.” These witnesses were “a little struck that there wasn’t\\n\\nmore emotion or concern” and described Schmitt’s demeanor as\\n\\n“very emotionless, very plain[,]” and “nonchalant[,]” “a little\\n\\ndefensive[,]” and seemingly not concerned about Jahangard. These\\n\\nwitnesses also testified as to differing accounts Schmitt provided\\n\\nabout what happened: (1) Jahangard pushed a trashcan on\\n\\nSchmitt’s car, which bounced off and knocked Jahangard over; (2)\\n\\nSchmitt could not remember what happened, or (3) Jahangard\\n\\njumped in front of his car. The State contended the fact that in each\\n\\naccount Schmitt mentioned the argument, mentioned the golf ball,\\n\\n                                 21\\n and downplayed Jahangard’s injuries further evidenced Schmitt’s\\n\\ncriminal intent.\\n\\n     On the other hand, Schmitt asserts that evidence from before,\\n\\nduring, and after the collision shows an absence of criminal intent.\\n\\nAmong other things, Schmitt points to his testimony that he\\n\\nintended to de-escalate the situation and talk it over, he misjudged\\n\\nthe turning radius of his car, he lost his focus on Jahangard while\\n\\nmaking the turn, he instinctively cut his wheel to the right and hit\\n\\nthe brakes, and he exited the car and, without turning it off,\\n\\nrendered immediate aid. Schmitt corroborated his testimony about\\n\\nrendering aid with witness testimony and video footage. Schmitt\\n\\nalso denied using the car as a weapon or to strike Jahangard.\\n\\nMoreover, Schmitt presented expert testimony opining that\\n\\nSchmitt’s brake lights came on twice and that Schmitt veered away\\n\\nfrom Jahangard, thus indicating his efforts to slow down and avoid\\n\\nhitting Jahangard, Schmitt moved between fifteen and sixteen miles\\n\\nper hour during the turn, and that the car did not run over\\n\\nJahangard’s leg. Further, expert testimony highlighted that the\\n\\n                                22\\n GBI’s investigative report did not reveal the presence of automotive\\n\\npaint, plastic, or grease on Jahangard’s clothes.\\n\\n     Although there was certainly evidence supporting the State’s\\n\\ntheory that Schmitt acted with malice, that evidence was disputed\\n\\nand not overwhelming. This is especially so when undisputed\\n\\nevidence showed that Schmitt turned his car away from Jahangard\\n\\nsuch that only the edge of his car struck Jahangard, Schmitt\\n\\nimmediately rendered aid, and Schmitt did not leave or try to leave\\n\\nuntil police officers dismissed him. See Rush v. State, \\n294 Ga. 388\\n,\\n\\n390 (2) (a) (\\n754 SE2d 63\\n) (2014) (evidence of a defendant’s attempt\\n\\nto flee or evade arrest can be circumstantial evidence of guilt).\\n\\n     The State contends that any error was harmless because the\\n\\ntrial court did not foreclose Schmitt’s accident defense and because,\\n\\nin finding Schmitt guilty of malice murder, the jury necessarily\\n\\nrejected this defense. We disagree.\\n\\n     One way that the failure to give an accident instruction can be\\n\\nharmless is if the jury finds the defendant guilty of malice murder\\n\\nafter “the trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements of\\n\\n                                  23\\n murder and the requisite malicious intent[,]” because the jury’s\\n\\nconclusion that the defendant acted with malice necessarily means\\n\\nthat the jury would have discredited the accident defense. McClain\\n\\nv. State, \\n303 Ga. 6\\n, 9-10 (2) (\\n810 SE2d 77\\n) (2018); see also Sears v.\\n\\nState, \\n290 Ga. 1\\n, 4 (3) (\\n717 SE2d 453\\n) (2011); Hannah v. State, \\n278\\n\\nGa. 195\\n, 197 (2) (\\n599 SE2d 177\\n) (2004). But that conclusion does not\\n\\nfollow here where, in addition to failing to instruct the jury on the\\n\\ndefense of accident, the trial court instructed the jury to disregard\\n\\nthat accident was a key legal principle — even though Schmitt\\n\\ntestified that the collision was an accident, and during Schmitt’s\\n\\nclosing argument in response to a demonstrative slide defining\\n\\naccident as the lack of criminal intent. 15\\n\\n      Qualified jurors are presumed to follow jury instructions. See\\n\\nRobinson v. State, \\n308 Ga. 543\\n, 552 (2) (b) (ii) (\\n842 SE2d 54\\n) (2020).\\n\\n\\n\\n      15 Although the trial court directed that Schmitt could “argue that it was\\n\\nunintentional” such that he lacked the requisite criminal intent, this\\nclarification was outside the presence of the jury. Schmitt explained to the jury\\nthat “the principle [was] correct” that “[i]f this was an accident, if there was no\\ncriminal intent, then it’s not a crime.” But by then, the trial court had already\\ninstructed the jury to “disregard” that accident was a key legal principle in this\\ncase.\\n                                        24\\n Because the trial court instructed the jury to disregard accident as\\n\\na key legal principle, we assume that the jury followed this\\n\\ninstruction and so disregarded accident as a key legal principle in\\n\\nreaching the verdicts.\\n\\n     Moreover, the trial court’s failure to instruct the jury on the\\n\\ndefense of accident taken together with the trial court’s direction\\n\\nthat the jury “disregard” accident as a “key legal principle” meant\\n\\nthat the jury was not authorized to find that the collision was an\\n\\naccident. Although Schmitt presented evidence supporting his\\n\\naccident theory and advanced this theory in his opening statements,\\n\\nthroughout trial, and in his closing argument, the trial court refused\\n\\nthe instruction and so “deprived the jury of the necessary tools to\\n\\nevaluate the charges against [Schmitt] and to reach a verdict[.]”\\n\\nHenry v. State, \\n307 Ga. 140\\n, 146 (2) (c) (\\n834 SE2d 861\\n) (2019) (“[J]ury\\n\\ninstructions are the lamp to guide the jury’s feet in journeying\\n\\nthrough the testimony in search of a legal verdict.” (punctuation and\\n\\ncitation omitted)).\\n\\n     Under these circumstances, we cannot say that it is highly\\n\\n                                  25\\n probable that the trial court’s error in declining the accident\\n\\ninstruction did not contribute to the verdict for malice murder. We\\n\\ntherefore reverse Schmitt’s conviction as to this count.\\n\\n     (c) Schmitt also contends that the trial court erred in declining\\n\\nthe accident instruction as to the remaining counts, and that this\\n\\nerror was not harmless. We agree and accordingly reverse those\\n\\ncounts as well.\\n\\n     Because we reverse the malice murder conviction, the felony\\n\\nmurder counts predicated on aggravated assault are no longer\\n\\nvacated as a matter of law. See Clough v. State, \\n298 Ga. 594\\n, 597-\\n\\n598 (2) (\\n783 SE2d 637\\n) (2016) (considering impact of trial court’s\\n\\nfailure to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter as to vacated\\n\\nfelony murder counts, after concluding the malice murder conviction\\n\\nwas due to be reversed). Thus, we address whether the trial court\\n\\nerred in omitting the accident instruction as to those counts.\\n\\n     The indictment charged Schmitt with a total of five counts.\\n\\nCount 1 charged him with malice murder. Count 2 charged him with\\n\\nfelony murder predicated on aggravated assault as alleged in Count\\n\\n                                 26\\n 4, which alleged that he committed an assault on Jahangard’s\\n\\nperson with a motor vehicle by striking him with such vehicle.16\\n\\nCount 3 charged him with felony murder predicated on aggravated\\n\\nassault as alleged in Count 5, which alleged that he committed an\\n\\nassault on Jahangard’s person with a motor vehicle and by driving\\n\\ntowards     Jahangard,       thereby        placing   him     in   reasonable\\n\\napprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury. 17\\n\\n      In contrast to malice murder, “[p]roof of felony murder does not\\n\\nrequire proving malice or the intent to kill, but only that the\\n\\ndefendant had the requisite criminal intent to commit the\\n\\nunderlying felony.” Tessmer v. State, \\n273 Ga. 220\\n, 222 (2) (\\n539 SE2d\\n\\n816\\n) (2000) (citations and punctuation omitted); see also OCGA § 16-\\n\\n5-1 (c) (“A person commits the offense of murder when, in the\\n\\n\\n      16 Count 4 charged that Schmitt “did unlawfully commit an assault upon\\n\\nthe person of Hamid Jahangard with a motor vehicle, an object which when\\nused offensively against another is likely to result in serious bodily injury, by\\nstriking him with said motor vehicle[.]”\\n      17 Count 5 charged that Schmitt “did unlawfully commit an assault upon\\n\\nthe person of Hamid Jahangard with a motor vehicle, an object which when\\nused offensively against another is likely to result in serious bodily injury, by\\ndriving at toward and in the direction of the said Hamid Jahangard, said act\\nplacing him in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent\\ninjury[.]”\\n                                       27\\n commission of a felony, he or she causes the death of another human\\n\\nbeing irrespective of malice.” (emphasis added)). It follows, then, that\\n\\nalthough felony murder has no specific mens rea that accident can\\n\\ndefeat, accident can effectively act as a defense to felony murder\\n\\nwhen it is a defense to the predicate offense. See Tessmer, \\n273 Ga.\\n\\nat 222-223\\n (2) (identifying no error in charging the jury that accident\\n\\nwas not a defense to felony murder, given that the jury also was\\n\\ncharged that accident was a defense to the underlying felony of\\n\\naggravated assault and that it could not convict for felony murder\\n\\nunless defendant was found guilty of the underlying felony of\\n\\naggravated assault; noting that “mens rea is a necessary element of\\n\\naggravated assault”); see also Scott v. State, \\n306 Ga. 417\\n, 422-423\\n\\n(3) (\\n831 SE2d 813\\n) (2019) (holding trial court did not plainly err in\\n\\ninstructing the jury that “the defense of accident did not apply to\\n\\nfelony murder based on aggravated assault if the jury found that the\\n\\naggravated assault was intentional” (emphasis added)). And here,\\n\\nthe indictment predicated the two felony murder counts on the\\n\\noffense of aggravated assault.\\n\\n                                  28\\n      Aggravated assault has two elements: (1) the commission of a\\n\\nsimple assault under OCGA § 16-5-20 and (2) the presence of a\\n\\nstatutory aggravator. See OCGA § 16-5-21 (a). “[T]he simple assault\\n\\nencompassed within aggravated assault may be committed in two\\n\\nways: when a person ‘[a]ttempts to commit a violent injury to the\\n\\nperson of another,’ OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (1), or when a person\\n\\n‘[c]ommits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension\\n\\nof immediately receiving a violent injury. [OCGA § 16-5-20] (a) (2).’”\\n\\nKipp v. State, \\n294 Ga. 55\\n, 59 (2) (a) (\\n751 SE2d 83\\n) (2013).\\n\\n     The substance of Count 4 alleged that Schmitt committed a\\n\\nsimple assault under OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (1), and the substance of\\n\\nCount 5 alleged that Schmitt committed a simple assault under\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (2). In both counts, the statutory aggravator\\n\\nalleged is that Schmitt committed assault “with a motor vehicle, an\\n\\nobject which when used offensively against another is likely to result\\n\\nin serious bodily injury[.]” See OCGA § 16-5-21 (a) (2). Against this\\n\\nbackdrop, and considering that “[the] accident defense applies where\\n\\nthe evidence negates the defendant’s criminal intent, whatever that\\n\\n                                 29\\n intent element is for the crime at issue,” Ogilvie, \\n292 Ga. at 9\\n (2) (b),\\n\\nwe address separately the aggravated assault allegations in Counts\\n\\n4 and 5.\\n\\n     (i) Aggravated Assault as Alleged in Count 4\\n\\n     The crime of simple assault as set forth in OCGA § 16-5-20 (a)\\n\\n(1) requires “the presence of criminal intent[.]” Kipp, \\n294 Ga. at 59\\n\\n\\n(2) (a). There must be an “intent to cause harm[,]” which refers “to\\n\\nthe requisite mens rea of intent” and also “to a defendant’s\\n\\ndeliberate purpose to accomplish an injurious result.” State v.\\n\\nSpringer, \\n297 Ga. 376\\n, 381 (1) (\\n774 SE2d 106\\n) (2015).\\n\\n     Here, as set forth above, more than slight evidence negated\\n\\nthat Schmitt acted with the intent to cause harm or with the\\n\\ndeliberate purpose of harming Jahangard. Because more than slight\\n\\nevidence negated that Schmitt acted with the requisite criminal\\n\\nintent, the trial court erred in declining the accident instruction as\\n\\nto Counts 2 and 4.\\n\\n     (ii) Aggravated Assault as Alleged in Count 5\\n\\n     The crime of simple assault as set forth in OCGA § 16-5-20 (a)\\n\\n                                   30\\n (2) requires the State to prove that the defendant acted with\\n\\ncriminal intent to commit the act which caused the victim to be\\n\\nreasonably apprehensive of receiving a violent injury. See Patterson\\n\\nv. State, \\n299 Ga. 491\\n, 493 (\\n789 SE2d 175\\n) (2016) (holding that the\\n\\nState need not prove the defendant driver acted with a specific\\n\\nintent to place the victim in such apprehension when “evidence of\\n\\n[the defendant’s] intent to drive the vehicle as he did [was]\\n\\nundisputed”); see also Stobbart v. State, \\n272 Ga. 608\\n, 611 (3) (\\n533\\n\\nSE2d 379\\n) (2000) (“There is an intent of the accused that must be\\n\\nshown, but it is only the criminal intent to commit the acts which\\n\\ncaused the victim to be reasonably apprehensive of receiving a\\n\\nviolent injury[.]” (emphasis added; citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)).\\n\\n     The State contends, and Schmitt concedes, that Patterson\\n\\nprecluded the accident instruction as to Counts 3 and 5, because\\n\\nSchmitt intended to do the act which placed Jahangard in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                31\\n reasonable apprehension of immediate violent injury. 18 Both parties\\n\\nappear to interpret Patterson to mean that because Schmitt\\n\\nintended to turn his car, an accident instruction was improper as to\\n\\nthese counts because the State did not have to prove that Schmitt\\n\\nacted with the specific intent to place Jahangard in reasonable\\n\\napprehension of immediate violent injury. But that construction\\n\\nomits altogether the requirement that a defendant act with criminal\\n\\nintent in committing the act which places another in such\\n\\napprehension.\\n\\n      In Patterson, during an argument in which the victim asked\\n\\nPatterson to leave, “Patterson went to his vehicle, put it into gear,\\n\\nrevved the engine, and rapidly drove directly toward the end of the\\n\\nhome, near [the victim], who became pinned against the side of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      18 In his brief and at oral argument, Schmitt conceded that Patterson was\\n\\nbinding as to Counts 3 and 5, such that the trial court did not err in declining\\nthe accident instruction as to those counts. Instead of arguing that Patterson\\ndoes not preclude the accident defense as to these counts, Schmitt asked that\\nwe overrule Patterson. But we are not required to accept a party’s concession\\non a matter of law. And because Patterson as we explain it today did not\\npreclude the accident defense as to these counts, we do not reach the question\\nof reconsidering it.\\n                                      32\\n home by the vehicle[.]” \\n299 Ga. at 491\\n. Patterson’s criminal intent\\n\\nin performing these acts was clear: “evidence of Patterson’s intent to\\n\\ndrive the vehicle as he did [was] undisputed.” \\nId. at 493\\n (emphasis\\n\\nadded). Thus, the requirement that Patterson act with criminal\\n\\nintent as he did the act which placed the victim in such\\n\\napprehension was satisfied.\\n\\n     In contrast, at least some evidence supports Schmitt’s claim\\n\\nthat, although he intended to turn his car, he did not intend to turn\\n\\nit in the way that he did, so he did not have criminal intent. Because\\n\\nat least slight evidence created such a question as to whether\\n\\nSchmitt acted with the requisite intent, the trial court erred in\\n\\ndeclining the accident instruction as to Counts 3 and 5.\\n\\n     Finally, for the same reasons as above, the trial court’s error in\\n\\ndeclining the accident instruction as to Counts 2, 3, 4, and 5 was not\\n\\nharmless, and so we reverse those counts.\\n\\n     Judgment reversed.

Gen., for appellee.\\nHINES, Justice.\\nA jury found Carl Mickens guilty of two counts of felony murder, arson in the first degree, burglary, and terroristic threats in connection with the deaths of Roderick Green and his young son, Roderick Green, Jr. Mickens was sentenced for the felony murders and for terroristic threats. He appeals his convictions solely on the basis of the sufficiency of the evidence. Finding the evidence of Mickens\\'s guilt sufficient to sustain the convictions, we affirm.[1]\\nWhen evaluating the sufficiency of evidence, the proper standard for review is whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). This Court does not reweigh evidence or resolve conflicts in testimony; instead, evidence is reviewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, with deference to the jury\\'s assessment of the weight and credibility of the evidence. Cimildoro v. State, 259 Ga. 788, 387 S.E.2d 335 (1990).\\nDean v. State, 273 Ga. 806-807, 546 S.E.2d 499 (2001).\\nThe evidence construed in favor of the verdicts showed that Carl Mickens met Vickie Green in the fall of 1997, while they were both employed at a grocery store. Soon after beginning an intimate relationship, Mickens became violent toward Green. He would shove, pull, and bite her, and he also stole money from her. On more than one occasion, Mickens threatened to burn down Green\\'s mobile home.\\n*352 Green became pregnant with Mickens\\'s child. She decided to terminate the pregnancy, and when she informed Mickens of her plans to do so, he threatened that he would \"hurt [her] without touching [her].\" After Green ended the pregnancy, Mickens continued to telephone her and to try to see her.\\nOn January 4, 1998, Mickens went to Green\\'s mobile home and took her glasses, identification card, and keys, and ran out the door. Mickens\\'s cousin, Tommy Baisden, drove him to a store, where Mickens made a duplicate of Green\\'s house key and purchased lighter fluid. When Baisden asked Mickens what he intended to do, Mickens responded that he \"was going to burn Vickie up,\" and \"That b____ must don\\'t know who she f _____ with. I will f____ her up.\" Baisden was able to dissuade Mickens from burning down the mobile home that day.\\nGreen notified police of the theft but she did not pursue the prosecution of Mickens because she was afraid of him. Eventually, Green\\'s mother persuaded Mickens to return the taken items; however, Mickens still had the duplicate house key.\\nDuring most of December, 1997, and January, 1998, Green did not stay in her mobile home because she was afraid of Mickens. However, Green\\'s brother, Roderick Green, and his young son, Roderick Green, Jr., were sharing the mobile home with Green and still resided there. On January 31, 1998, Green was at her mobile home and around midnight she left to go to a club. She arrived at the club at approximately 1:30 a.m. and immediately saw her brother Roderick. Roderick left the club between 1:45 a.m. and 2:00 a.m., picked up his son from the babysitter, and returned to his sister\\'s mobile home. At approximately 2:30 a.m., Green left the club with a cousin and traveled back to the mobile home park, where both women had homes. While dropping her cousin off at home, Green noticed that her own mobile home was on fire. Firefighters discovered the bodies of Green\\'s brother and nephew inside Green\\'s mobile home. They had died from heat and smoke inhalation.\\nInitially, investigators believed that the fire had occurred accidentally. Approximately a year later, authorities received information that the fire had been intentionally set, and further investigation revealed evidence of arson. Baisden made a statement to police about the fire. Baisden explained that he had not previously come forward to the police because he feared he would be accused of setting the fire. He stated that he drove Mickens to the home of Marie Dowell, a cousin of both Mickens and Baisden, on January 31, 1998. After staying at Dowell\\'s house for some time that evening, Mickens asked Baisden to drive him to Green\\'s house. Once there, Mickens entered the mobile home with the key he had previously copied, while Baisden fell asleep in the car. Baisden was awakened by the heat and noise coming from the mobile home, which was ablaze. He then picked up Mickens, who was standing near some mailboxes, and the two left the area.\\nDowell confirmed that both men were at her house the evening before the fire occurred.\\nMickens\\'s longtime friend, Henry Arnold, Jr., also came forward with information about the fire. While Arnold was in police custody in early February, 1998, Mickens came to visit him. During the visit, Mickens confided in Arnold that he had set the fatal fire by putting lighter fluid on the stove.\\nMickens contends that the State\\'s evidence was legally insufficient because the State\\'s key witnesses Baisden and Arnold testified against him as a result of receiving benefits from the State for doing so; their testimony contained omissions and inconsistencies; testimony from the defense expert about the cause of the fire completely contradicted such testimony by the State\\'s expert and there was no physical evidence linking him to the crimes; and the defense presented an alibi witness. But the contentions are unavailing.\\nThe issue of any possible bias or motivation for Baisden and Arnold\\'s testimony was fully explored before the jury. It was for the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses and to resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies in the evidence. Dean v. State, supra; Hampton v. State, 272 Ga. 284, *353 285(1), 527 S.E.2d 872 (2000). Even in the face of experts offering conflicting evidence regarding the cause of the fire, it is the province of the jury to decide which testimony is most believable. Brooks v. Cellin Mfg. Co., 251 Ga. 395, 398(4), 306 S.E.2d 657 (1983). Likewise, the jury was authorized to disbelieve the alibi testimony and credit the testimony of the State\\'s witnesses. Woods v. State, 275 Ga. 844(1), 573 S.E.2d 394 (2002). The evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find Mickens guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes for which he was convicted. Jackson v. Virginia, supra.\\nJudgments affirmed.\\nAll the Justices concur.\\nNOTES\\n[1] The terroristic threats occurred on January 4, 1998; the remaining crimes occurred on February 1, 1998. On September 27, 2001, a Dougherty County grand jury indicted Carl Mickens for the felony murder of Roderick Green while in the commission of arson in the first degree and/or burglary; the felony murder of Roderick Green, Jr. while in the commission of arson in the first degree and/or burglary; arson in the first degree; burglary; and terroristic threats. Mickens was tried before a jury July 8-12, 2002, and was found guilty of all charges. He was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment for the felony murders and a term of five years in prison, consecutive to the second life sentence, for terroristic threats. The arson and burglary counts merged for the purpose of sentencing. A notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals was filed August 5, 2002. On August 15, 2003, Mickens filed an amended notice of appeal to this Court. The appeal was docketed in this Court on October 17, 2003, and the case was submitted for decision on December 8, 2003.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1351880/mickens-v-state/'}),\n",

FREY et al. v. NATIONWIDE MUTUAL\\n     INSURANCE COMPANY.\\n\\n      BARNES, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      William Michael Frey was fatally injured in an automobile accident when his\\n\\nmotorcycle was struck by another vehicle. His widow, Irish Angela Frey, individually\\n\\nand as executrix of his estate, sued Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company,\\n\\ncontending that a commercial general liability insurance policy that Nationwide issued\\n\\nto the other driver provided coverage for the accident.1 Nationwide moved for\\n\\njudgment on the pleadings, contending that the insurance policy clearly and\\n\\nunambiguously excluded coverage for the automobile accident. The trial court agreed\\n\\nwith Nationwide and entered a final order granting the motion. Irish now appeals,\\n\\n\\n      1\\n          For clarity, we will refer to the Freys by their first names.\\n asserting that the trial court misconstrued the insurance policy’s automobile\\n\\nexclusion. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\\n\\n             On appeal from a grant of judgment on the pleadings, we conduct\\n      a de novo review of the trial court’s order to determine whether the\\n      undisputed facts appearing from the pleadings entitle the movant to\\n      judgment as a matter of law. The grant of a motion for judgment on the\\n      pleadings under OCGA § 9-11-12 (c) is proper only where there is a\\n      complete failure to state a cause of action or defense. For purposes of the\\n      motion, all well-pleaded material allegations by the nonmovant are taken\\n      as true, and all denials by the movant are taken as false. But the trial\\n      court need not adopt a party’s legal conclusions based on these facts.\\n      Moreover, in considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, a trial\\n      court may consider exhibits attached to and incorporated into the\\n      pleadings, including exhibits attached to the complaint or the answer.\\n\\n\\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Schumacher v. City of Roswell, \\n344 Ga. App. 135\\n,\\n\\n138 (\\n809 SE2d 262\\n) (2017).\\n\\n      Guided by the aforementioned principles, we turn to the facts alleged in Irish’s\\n\\ncomplaint as amended and in the exhibits attached thereto and to the answer. On the\\n\\nevening of June 4, 2017, Michael C. Jesperson, who allegedly had been drinking, was\\n\\ndriving his pickup truck down a state highway when he attempted to make a left turn\\n\\ninto the path of a funeral procession. While attempting the left turn, Jesperson struck\\n\\n                                          2\\n a motorcycle driven by William, who died as a result of the injuries he sustained.\\n\\nFollowing the accident, Irish, individually and as executrix of William’s estate,\\n\\nbrought a personal injury and wrongful death action against Jesperson. After a trial,\\n\\nthe jury returned a verdict finding Jesperson liable for the accident and awarding\\n\\n$1,655,647 in damages to Irish. Based on a limited liability release agreement, the\\n\\njudgment entered on the verdict specified that it was “only enforceable against any\\n\\nremaining liability insurance and/or underinsured motorist insurance coverage which\\n\\nprovide[d] coverage for the claims contained within [the] case.”\\n\\n      At the time of the accident, Jesperson had an automobile insurance policy with\\n\\nState Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, and he had a commercial general liability\\n\\ninsurance policy with Nationwide (the “CGL Policy”). William had insurance\\n\\npolicies with Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company and Progressive Insurance\\n\\nCompany that provided uninsured motorist (“UM”) coverage. Irish received\\n\\ninsurance proceeds from William’s two UM carriers2 and from Jesperson’s\\n\\nautomobile insurance carrier, State Farm. However, Nationwide disputed whether\\n\\n      2\\n        A dispute between Irish and Liberty Mutual over the amount of UM coverage\\nwas the subject of this Court’s opinion in Frey v. Jesperson, \\n366 Ga. App. 488\\n (\\n883\\nSE2d 419\\n) (2023). The issues addressed in that opinion are not pertinent to this\\nappeal.\\n                                          3\\n there was coverage for the automobile accident under Jesperson’s CGL Policy and\\n\\ndeclined to pay out any insurance proceeds.\\n\\n      Jesperson assigned any rights he might have under his CGL Policy to Irish.\\n\\nBased on that assignment, Irish commenced the present suit against Nationwide,\\n\\nseeking a declaratory judgment that the CGL Policy covered the automobile accident\\n\\nand that no policy exclusions applied. Irish also sought to recover damages from\\n\\nNationwide for the remaining unpaid amount of the judgment entered against\\n\\nJesperson in the wrongful death suit, plus interest. Nationwide answered, denying that\\n\\nthere was insurance coverage for the automobile accident, and attached a copy of the\\n\\nCGL Policy as an exhibit.\\n\\n      Nationwide subsequently moved for judgment on the pleadings, contending\\n\\nthat the CGL Policy excluded coverage for any bodily injury that arose out of use of\\n\\nthe insured’s (i.e., Jesperson’s) automobile, such that all of Irish’s claims failed as a\\n\\nmatter of law. In response to the motion, Irish argued that the automobile exclusion\\n\\nreasonably could be construed more narrowly as only applying when the insured’s\\n\\nautomobile was used by or entrusted to a third party, and that any ambiguity in the\\n\\ncontractual language should be construed in her favor. The trial court rejected Irish’s\\n\\n\\n                                           4\\n argument, concluding that the CGL Policy unambiguously excluded coverage under\\n\\nthe facts as alleged in this case. As a result, the trial court granted Nationwide’s\\n\\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings, and this appeal followed in which Irish\\n\\ncontends that the court misconstrued the automobile exclusion.\\n\\n      “Under Georgia law, insurance companies are generally free to set the terms\\n\\nof their policies as they see fit so long as they do not violate the law or judicially\\n\\ncognizable public policy,” and “a carrier may agree to insure against certain risks\\n\\nwhile declining to insure against others.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) H. J.\\n\\nRussell & Co. v. Landmark American Ins. Co., \\n369 Ga. App. 6\\n, 7 (\\n891 SE2d 531\\n) (2023).\\n\\nIt is well-established that\\n\\n      insurance is a matter of contract, and the parties to an insurance policy\\n      are bound by its plain and unambiguous terms. Thus, when faced with\\n      a conflict over coverage, a trial court must first determine, as a matter of\\n      law, whether the relevant policy language is ambiguous. As this Court\\n      has explained, an ambiguity is duplicity, indistinctness, or an uncertainty\\n      of meaning or expression, and a word or phrase is ambiguous when it is\\n      of uncertain meaning and may be fairly understood in more ways than\\n      one. Where a term of a policy of insurance is susceptible to two or more\\n      reasonable constructions, and the resulting ambiguity cannot be resolved,\\n      the term will be strictly construed against the insurer as the drafter and\\n      in favor of the insured. If a policy exclusion is unambiguous, however, it\\n\\n                                           5\\n       must be given effect even if beneficial to the insurer and detrimental to\\n      the insured. We will not strain to extend coverage where none was\\n      contracted or intended. Whether ambiguity exists in a contract is a\\n      question of law for a trial court.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Sharma v. City of Alpharetta, \\n361 Ga. App. 692\\n,\\n\\n695 (\\n865 SE2d 287\\n) (2021). Guided by these principles, we turn to the CGL Policy.\\n\\n       The CGL Policy attached to Nationwide’s answer identifies the named insured\\n\\nas Jesperson “dba Mike the Glass Guy,” lists his business as “custom glass work,”\\n\\nand provides $1,000,000 in insurance coverage per occurrence. The CGL Policy\\n\\nspecifies that Nationwide “will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally\\n\\nobligated to pay as damages because of ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ to which\\n\\nthis insurance applies,” but it includes an exclusion for “Aircraft, Auto or\\n\\nWatercraft” that provides in part:\\n\\n      This insurance does not apply to: . . . “Bodily injury” or “property\\n      damage” arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment\\n      to others of any aircraft, “auto” or watercraft owned or operated by or\\n      rented or loaned to any insured. Use includes operation[.]\\n\\n\\n(the “Automobile Exclusion”). “Auto” is defined in part as “[a] land motor vehicle\\n\\n. . . designed for travel on public roads.”\\n\\n                                              6\\n        The parties’ interpretive dispute centers on the circumstances under which use\\n\\nof the insured’s automobile excludes coverage under the CGL Policy. Nationwide\\n\\nargues that the Automobile Exclusion unambiguously excludes coverage for bodily\\n\\ninjury arising out of the use of the insured’s automobile, irrespective of whether the\\n\\nautomobile is used by the insured or someone else. In contrast, Irish argues that the\\n\\nAutomobile Exclusion is ambiguous and reasonably can be construed in her favor as\\n\\nexcluding coverage only when the insured’s automobile is used by or entrusted to\\n\\nsomeone other than the insured.\\n\\n       We conclude that the Automobile Exclusion is susceptible of only one\\n\\nreasonable construction, and it is the one advanced by Nationwide. By its plain\\n\\nlanguage, the Automobile Exclusion excludes coverage under the CGL Policy for\\n\\nbodily injury “arising out of the . . . use . . . of any . . . auto . . . owned . . . by . . . any\\n\\ninsured.” (Internal punctuation omitted.) And the Automobile Exclusion does not\\n\\ncontain any language limiting or qualifying who must be using the insured’s automobile\\n\\nwhen the bodily injury occurs. “Because the words in this contract are plain and\\n\\nobvious, they must be given their literal meaning and no new terms can be inserted.”\\n\\nWilbanks v. Mai, \\n232 Ga. App. 198\\n, 199 (\\n501 SE2d 513\\n) (1998). “Where the\\n\\n\\n                                                7\\n contractual language is explicit and unambiguous, the court’s job is simply to apply\\n\\nthe terms of the contract as written[.]” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Ga. Farm\\n\\nBureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Smith, \\n298 Ga. 716\\n, 719 (\\n784 SE2d 422\\n) (2016). Accordingly,\\n\\nbased on the unambiguous language of the Automobile Exclusion, the CGL Policy\\n\\ndoes not provide coverage where the bodily injury arose out of use of the insured’s\\n\\nautomobile, regardless of whether the automobile was used by the insured or someone\\n\\nelse. See Strickland v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., \\n273 Ga. App. 662\\n, 666 (2) (\\n615 SE2d 808\\n)\\n\\n(2005) (concluding, in case involving the identical automobile exclusion, that the\\n\\nlanguage of the exclusion was “clear” and applied broadly to automobile accidents\\n\\ninvolving the insured’s equipment or drivers); Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pat’s\\n\\nRentals, \\n228 Ga. App. 854\\n, 855-856 (a) (\\n492 SE2d 702\\n) (1997) (concluding that the\\n\\nidentical automobile exclusion was “clear and unambiguous” and applied to the\\n\\n“negligent operation and use of the motor vehicle of the insured by its employee for\\n\\ngeneral and special damages”), rev’d in part on other grounds by \\n269 Ga. 691\\n (\\n505\\n\\nSE2d 729\\n) (1998). See also McKeel v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., No. CV413-211, \\n2015 U.S.\\n\\nDist. LEXIS 36924\\n, at *7, \\n2015 WL 1333998\\n, at *3 (S.D. Ga. Mar. 24, 2015)\\n\\n(determining in case involving the identical automobile exclusion that “[b]ased on\\n\\n\\n                                          8\\n [its] clear and unambiguous language, the policy does not provide coverage for any\\n\\nbodily injury that is based on the use of a vehicle operated by an insured”).3\\n\\n      Irish, however, argues that the absence of a serial comma4 in the series “the\\n\\nownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others” creates an ambiguity in the\\n\\nAutomobile Exclusion that should be construed in her favor. See Sharma, 361 Ga.\\n\\nApp. at 695 (reciting that when an ambiguity in an insurance contract cannot be\\n\\n\\n      3\\n         As reflected in the cases cited above, the language of the Automobile\\nExclusion is not unique to the CGL Policy. According to one pertinent treatise,\\nlanguage identical to that found in the Automobile Exclusion is “often included in a\\n[commercial general liability] policy to avoid overlapping coverage with an automobile\\ninsurance policy.” J. Stephen Berry, Georgia Property & Liability Insurance Law §\\n5:17 (August 2023 update). See generally 9A Couch on Insurance § 129:32 (November\\n2023 update) (noting that “commercial general liability policies typically exclude auto\\ncoverage”); Crider v. Zurich Ins. Co., \\n222 Ga. App. 177\\n, 179 (2) (\\n474 SE2d 89\\n) (1996)\\n(explaining that “[g]eneral liability policies are purchased primarily to provide\\ncoverage for incidents other than those covered under automobile liability policies”).\\nAccord Strickland, \\n273 Ga. App. at 664\\n (1) (noting that under the standard practice\\nof the trucking industry, where the insured trucking company purchases separate\\ncommercial general liability insurance and automobile insurance policies, the general\\nexpectation of the insured and insureds is “that there would be two policies of\\ninsurance without overlapping coverage”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n      4\\n         “[T]he serial comma is the comma used before the conjunction joining the\\nfinal term in a series.” (Citation omitted.) Christian v. Christian, \\n300 Ga. 263\\n, 265 (2),\\nn. 2 (\\n794 SE2d 51\\n) (2016). See Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The\\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 165 (2012) (explaining that the “serial comma” is “the\\ncomma after the penultimate item in a series just before the conjunction (a, b, and\\nc)”).\\n                                            9\\n resolved, the contract “will be strictly construed against the insurer as the drafter and\\n\\nin favor of the insured”) (citation and punctuation omitted). Specifically, she asserts\\n\\nthat, without a comma between “use” and “or entrustment,” the Automobile\\n\\nExclusion lacks clarity, and one reasonable construction of the Exclusion is that it\\n\\nexcludes coverage only when the insured’s automobile is used by or entrusted to\\n\\nsomeone else. Put another way, Irish maintains that in the absence of a comma\\n\\nbetween “use” and “or entrustment,” the prepositional phrase “to others” that\\n\\nfollows “entrustment” reasonably can be construed as modifying both “use” and\\n\\n“entrustment.” Irish therefore asserts that the Automobile Exclusion reasonably can\\n\\nbe interpreted as not applying where the insured’s automobile is used by the insured.\\n\\n      Irish’s argument is unpersuasive. The absence of a serial comma in a series\\n\\ncarries little weight where, as here, the interpretation that is advanced otherwise\\n\\nconflicts with well-recognized rules of grammar and with standard English usage. See\\n\\nChristian v. Christian, \\n300 Ga. 263\\n, 265-266 (2) (\\n794 SE2d 51\\n) (2016) (rejecting\\n\\ninterpretation of contract that emphasized the lack of a serial comma, where the\\n\\ninterpretation otherwise was implausible and not supported by the English language).\\n\\nSee Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal\\n\\n\\n                                           10\\n Texts 166 (2012) (noting that “although the better practice is to use the serial comma,\\n\\ncourts should not rely much if any on its omission”). As our Supreme Court has\\n\\nemphasized, “contractual terms are construed according to their usual and common\\n\\nsignification, and in construing contracts, the rules of grammatical construction\\n\\nusually govern.” (Citations, punctuation, and footnote omitted.)

OB-GYN Assocs. v. Brown, \\n357 Ga.

See Ga. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Smith, \\n298 Ga. 716\\n, 719, 721 (\\n784\\n\\nSE2d 422\\n) (2016) (noting that courts should avoid a “strained construction” of an\\n\\ninsurance policy, that “[w]ords used in [a] policy are given their usual and common\\n\\nmeaning,” and that “the policy should be read as a layman would read it”) (citations\\n\\nand punctuation omitted); Kushner v.

Moreover, given that the\\n\\nword “to” immediately follows the word “entrustment” in the Automobile\\n\\n\\n                                         12\\n Exclusion, “to” can only be reasonably construed as a “function word . . . to indicate\\n\\nthe receiver of an action or the one for which something is done,”5 and thus its pairing\\n\\nwith the word “use” would be nonsensical in this context. Instead, for Irish’s\\n\\nproposed construction to make grammatical sense and comport with standard English\\n\\nusage, the word “by” would need to be inserted after the word “use,” so that the\\n\\npertinent phrase would read “arising out of the . . . use by or entrustment to others,”\\n\\nbut that would require us “to rewrite or revise the contract under the guise of\\n\\nconstruing it, which, of course, we are not at liberty to do.” (Citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted.) Brazeal v. Newpoint Media Group, \\n331 Ga. App. 49\\n, 56-57 (\\n769 SE2d 763\\n)\\n\\n(2015). See OCGA § 13-2-2 (6) (specifying that “words may be supplied” to a\\n\\ncontract “[i]n extreme cases of ambiguity, where the instrument as it stands is without\\n\\nmeaning”); Carrier Corp. v.

Hence, contrary to Irish’s assertion, the limiting\\n\\nphrase “to others” can only be reasonably and naturally read as modifying\\n\\n“entrustment.” Cf. Cajun Contractors v. Peachtree Property Sub, LLC, \\n360 Ga. App.\\n\\n5\\n\\n       Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/\\ndictionary/to (website last visited April 18, 2024).\\n                                           13\\n 390, 414 (3) (a) (\\n861 SE2d 222\\n) (2021) (concluding that limiting phrase applied to\\n\\nboth antecedents “based on the separation of the [limiting phrase] from both\\n\\nantecedents by a comma”).\\n\\n      Lastly, Irish emphasizes that the CGL Policy contains an excess insurance\\n\\nprovision that states in part:\\n\\n      This insurance is excess over[ ] . . . [a]ny of the other insurance, whether\\n      primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis[ ] . . . [i]f the loss arises\\n      out of the maintenance or use of aircraft, “autos” or watercraft to the\\n      extent not subject to [the Automobile Exclusion].”\\n\\n\\n(the “Excess Insurance Provision”). Irish asserts that inclusion of the Excess\\n\\nInsurance Provision in the CGL Policy demonstrates that there must be some\\n\\nautomobile-related claims that are not subject to the Automobile Exclusion and that\\n\\nare covered by the CGL Policy, and she maintains that the Excess Insurance Provision\\n\\ntherefore supports her narrow construction of the “use” language in the Automobile\\n\\nExclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            14\\n       Irish’s reliance on the Excess Insurance Provision is misplaced. Notably, the\\n\\nAutomobile Exclusion expressly sets out several exceptions to its application,6 and the\\n\\nExcess Insurance Provision is most reasonably and naturally construed as referring to\\n\\nthose enumerated circumstances. See American Strategic Ins. Corp. v. Helm, \\n327 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 482\\n, 487 (\\n759 SE2d 563\\n) (2014) (noting that under the rules of construction,\\n\\n“each provision [of an insurance policy] is to be . . . interpreted so as to harmonize\\n\\n\\n      6\\n        The Automobile Exclusion provides in relevant part:\\n      [The Automobile Exclusion] does not apply to:\\n      (1) A watercraft while ashore on premises you own or rent;\\n      (2) A watercraft you do not own that is:\\n             (a) Less than 26 feet long; and\\n             (b) Not being used to carry persons or property for a charge;\\n      (3) Parking an “auto” on, or on the ways next to, premises you own or\\n      rent, provided the “auto” is not owned by or rented or loaned to you or\\n      the insured;\\n      (4) Liability assumed under any “insured contract” for the ownership,\\n      maintenance or use of aircraft or watercraft; or\\n      (5) “Bodily injury” or “property damage” arising out of:\\n             (a) The operation of machinery or equipment that is attached to,\\n      or part of, a land vehicle that would qualify under the definition of\\n      “mobile equipment” if it were not subject to a compulsory or financial\\n      responsibility law or other motor vehicle insurance law where it is\\n      licensed or principally garaged; or\\n             (b) The operation of any of the machinery or equipment listed in\\n      Paragraph f.(2) or f.(3) of the definition of “mobile equipment”.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          15\\n with the others”). Thus, the Excess Insurance Provision offers no support for Irish’s\\n\\nnarrow reading of the Automobile Exclusion as applying only when the insured’s\\n\\nautomobile is used by someone else.\\n\\n      For all of the preceding reasons, we conclude that because William’s bodily\\n\\ninjuries arose out of the use of the insured’s (i.e., Jesperson’s) automobile, the\\n\\nAutomobile Exclusion excluded coverage under the CGL Policy for the automobile\\n\\naccident. Therefore, Irish’s claims failed as a matter of law, and the trial court\\n\\ncommitted no error in granting Nationwide’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed.

ANDERSON v. KAYE et al.\\n\\n      WATKINS, Judge.\\n\\n      Precious Anderson appeals from the final judgment entered against her\\n\\nfollowing a bench trial awarding money damages to her former attorneys Scott Kaye\\n\\nand Holly Hughes on a theory of quantum meruit. Kaye and Hughes (collectively\\n\\n“Counsel”) sued Anderson alleging she owed them unpaid attorney fees from\\n\\nrepresentation in multiple domestic litigation matters. On appeal, Anderson argues\\n\\nthat the trial court erred in finding the statute of limitation had not run on Counsel’s\\n\\nclaims and in ruling that Counsel were not judicially estopped from seeking more fees\\n\\nthan had previously been awarded in the underlying domestic litigation. For the\\n\\nreasons set forth below, we vacate the trial court’s order and remand with instruction.\\n\\n      Georgia law provides that\\n       [o]n an appeal from an entry of judgment following a bench trial, we apply\\n      a de novo standard of review to any questions of law decided by the trial\\n      court, but will defer to any factual findings made by that court if there is\\n      any evidence to sustain them. Nevertheless, if the trial court makes a\\n      finding of fact which is unsupported by the record, that finding cannot be\\n      upheld, and any judgment based upon such a finding must be reversed.1\\n\\n\\n      So viewed, the record shows that in July 2016, Anderson first retained Counsel\\n\\nto represent her in obtaining a temporary protective order against her ex-husband\\n\\n(“TPO Litigation”). Subsequently in 2016, Counsel served as her attorneys in\\n\\nlitigation against her ex-husband in which both parties sought to modify issues from\\n\\ntheir prior divorce as well as seek contempt against each other (“Modification\\n\\nLitigation”). The record does not contain an executed retainer agreement between\\n\\nAnderson and Counsel.2\\n\\n      After obtaining favorable results for Anderson in the Modification Litigation,\\n\\nCounsel moved for attorney fees on Anderson’s behalf against the ex-husband. While\\n\\n\\n      1\\n       (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Sanders v. TD Auto Finance, LLC, \\n366 Ga.\\nApp. 376\\n, 378 (\\n883 SE2d 53\\n) (2023).\\n      2\\n         Counsel contends that there was an executed agreement but that they\\ninadvertently failed to maintain a copy. Anderson testified that she executed an\\nagreement for the representation in the TPO Litigation, but not the Modification\\nLitigation.\\n                                           2\\n that motion was pending, Anderson’s ex-husband appealed the trial court’s order in\\n\\nthe Modification Litigation, and Counsel represented Anderson throughout the appeal.\\n\\nThis Court affirmed the trial court; the Supreme Court of Georgia denied the ex-\\n\\nhusband’s petition for certiorari; and the case was remanded to the trial court. In 2018,\\n\\nonce back before the trial court, Anderson — who is an attorney — proceeded pro se\\n\\nseeking to recover fees she incurred through Counsel’s representation of her prior to\\n\\nCounsel’s appellate work in the amount of $79,837.50 as well as $4,221.11 in expenses.\\n\\nIn 2020, in the Modification Litigation, the trial court awarded $42,000 in attorney\\n\\nfees to be paid by the ex-husband to Anderson directly, not to Counsel. After receiving\\n\\nthe award, Anderson only made a few small payments to Counsel.\\n\\n      In August 2021, Counsel sued Anderson for unpaid attorney fees by bringing a\\n\\nsuit on an open account, alleging a breach of contract, and alternatively seeking to\\n\\nrecover the fees on a theory of quantum meruit.3 Anderson answered and asserted\\n\\nexpiration of the statute of limitation as an affirmative defense. Counsel served\\n\\ndiscovery requests on Anderson, but not all of her responses are in the record. During\\n\\n\\n\\n      3\\n        Counsel also sought through this litigation to foreclose on an attorney-fee lien\\nthey had filed. The trial court denied that relief, and Counsel have not appealed that\\nruling.\\n                                           3\\n a bench trial, however, Anderson admitted that she had served a verified interrogatory\\n\\nresponse which stated that she was withdrawing her statute of limitation defense.\\n\\nAnderson never amended her answer to withdraw this defense. Despite the discovery\\n\\nresponse she served, Anderson testified at trial that she intended to assert the\\n\\nexpiration of the statute of limitation as a defense. The trial court found Anderson\\n\\nliable for a total of $116,942.68 in attorney fees on a theory of quantum meruit.\\n\\nAnderson then appealed.\\n\\n      1. Anderson argues that the trial court erred in finding that the statute of\\n\\nlimitation did not preclude Counsel’s claim. We agree that at least some of Counsel’s\\n\\nclaims are time-barred.\\n\\n      Here, Counsel sought recovery of unpaid fees through claims of open account,\\n\\nbreach of contract, and quantum meruit. The trial court heard conflicting evidence\\n\\nabout whether a signed agreement existed between the parties but found that “[t]here\\n\\nis not a signed contract here.” As there is some evidence to support this factual finding\\n\\nby the trial court following a bench trial, we will not disturb it.4 Accordingly, Counsel\\n\\n      4\\n        “If there is any evidence to support the findings of fact by a trial court sitting\\nwithout a jury, then the appellate court affirms without interference with or disturbing\\nsuch factfindings.” Agricommodities, Inc. v. Moore, \\n359 Ga. App. 1\\n, 2 (\\n854 SE2d 781\\n)\\n(2021) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n                                            4\\n cannot avail themselves of the six-year statute of limitation for breach of written\\n\\ncontract claims.5\\n\\n      As to the remaining claims, the statutes of limitation for a suit on open account,\\n\\nbreach of an oral contract, and quantum meruit are all four years.6 “The true test to\\n\\ndetermine when a cause of action accrues is to ascertain the time when the plaintiff[s]\\n\\ncould first have maintained [their] action to a successful result.”7 Here, the trial court\\n\\ngranted Counsel their fees under a quantum meruit theory. Upon proceeding solely\\n\\npursuant to quantum meruit, the trial court erroneously found that “[n]o amount owed\\n\\nto [Counsel] is barred by any statute of limitation. . . . This case was brought well\\n\\nwithin the applicable statute of limitation.” Here, Counsel’s work for Anderson for\\n\\nwhich it seeks compensation began in 2016, and their lawsuit was filed in 2021 and\\n\\nserved in 2022. Some of the charges sought to be recovered were not pursued within\\n\\nfour years of accrual of the claim and thus, are time-barred.8\\n\\n      5\\n          See OCGA § 9-3-24.\\n      6\\n          See OCGA §§ 9-3-25; 9-3-26.\\n      7\\n        Travis Pruitt & Assocs., P.C. v.

First, Counsel contends that Anderson withdrew her statute-of-limitation\\n\\ndefense. We disagree. In her Answer, Anderson asserted the affirmative defense of the\\n\\nexpiration of the statute of limitation. Although her verified interrogatory responses\\n\\nare not in the record, Anderson does not dispute that in such responses she stated that\\n\\nshe was withdrawing this defense. She testified that even though she is a lawyer and\\n\\neven though she reviewed the responses before verifying them that she “did not catch\\n\\nthat.” Anderson does not claim that she ever amended these responses, however,\\n\\nduring trial, Anderson testified that she was not withdrawing this defense.\\n\\n      While we do not countenance this sort of “sandbagging,” Anderson’s discovery\\n\\nresponse did not operate as a formal withdrawal of her defense. Counsel is correct that\\n\\nGeorgia law provides that “[w]ithout offering the same in evidence, either party may\\n\\navail himself or herself of allegations or admissions made in the pleadings of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHughes were provided no later than April 2017 and, therefore, are time barred. We\\nexpress no opinion on the accuracy of this concession.\\n                                          6\\n other.”9 Interrogatory responses, however, are not a pleading as defined by Georgia\\n\\nlaw.10\\n\\n         Counsel are also correct that Georgia law holds that “[f]actual assertions in\\n\\npleadings and pretrial orders, unless amended, are considered judicial admissions\\n\\nconclusively binding on the party who made them.”11 But as stated previously,\\n\\ninterrogatory responses are not a pleading, and there was no pre-trial order with\\n\\nrepresentations made by the parties in this case.\\n\\n         Further, contrary to Counsel’s contention, Anderson was not legally estopped\\n\\nfrom asserting the affirmative defense pursuant to OCGA § 24-14-26. That statute\\n\\nprovides that “[c]onclusive presumptions of law are termed estoppels; averments to\\n\\nthe contrary of such presumptions shall not be allowed. Estoppels are not generally\\n\\n\\n         9\\n              OCGA § 24-8-821.\\n         10\\n         See OCGA § 9-11-7 (a) (“Pleadings.

Georgia law\\n\\nprovides that\\n\\n      each new promise to pay constitutes a new point from which the statute\\n      of limitation[ ] begins to run, provided two conditions are met.\\n      Specifically, the acknowledgment of the debt must be communicated to\\n      the creditor and it must sufficiently identify the debt or afford the means\\n      by which the debt might be identified with reasonable certainty.19\\n\\n\\n      In the case of SKC, Inc. v. eMAG Solutions,20 this Court detailed the evidence\\n\\nwhich has previously been deemed adequate to trigger the statute of limitations revival\\n\\npermitted by OCGA § 9-3-112 and its predecessors.\\n\\n      In Middlebrooks [v. Cabaniss],21 a debtor had made payments on a\\n      promissory note by checks made payable to the creditor and bearing the\\n      notation, “payment on my note” or expressions of the same import.\\n\\n\\n      19\\n       (Citation and punctuation omitted.) SKC, Inc. v. eMAG Solutions, LLC, \\n326\\nGa. App. 798\\n, 801 (1) (\\n755 SE2d 298\\n) (2014).\\n      20\\n           326 Ga.

Similarly, in Garrett [v. Lincoln\\nCemetary],22 an accountant sued to recover for amounts owed on an audit\\nthe accountant had performed for the defendant. The trial court granted\\njudgment in favor of the defendant, finding that because the debt had\\naccrued more than four years earlier the action was barred by the statute\\nof limitation. We reversed, noting that in the four years before suit was\\nfiled the defendant had made payments on the debt by check. On one\\ncheck the defendant had written “Legal & Audit on Acct.,” and on the\\nother it had written “Defendant’s Bal. $6,500.” Because the defendant\\nonly had one account with the plaintiff, we found that the checks\\nrepresented a new promise to pay and renewed the running of the\\nlimitation period.\\n\\n\\nIn [the SKC case], [the creditor] presented evidence showing that [the\\ndebtor] had accrued a debt in excess of $300,000 to [the creditor], had\\nacknowledged that debt in writing, and had agreed in writing to make\\nmonthly payments on the debt. [The creditor] also presented additional\\ndocumentary evidence demonstrating the debt and [the debtor’s]\\nacknowledgment of the same, including [the creditor’s] business records\\nof [the debtor’s] account and printouts from [the creditor’s] bank\\nevidencing the monthly wire transfer payments made by [the debtor] over\\nan approximately six-year period. Additionally, each of the printouts\\nevidencing [the debtor’s] wire transfer payments contain[ed] a notation\\n\\n22\\n     148 Ga.

The evidence further show[ed] that [the debtor] had\\n      only one account with [the creditor].23\\n\\n\\n      The above recited facts are markedly different than the ones present here.\\n\\nCounsel has pointed us to nowhere in the record, and we have found nothing ourselves,\\n\\ndemonstrating an acknowledgment by Anderson of her debt coupled with the de\\n\\nminimus partial payments she made. Accordingly, Counsel has not established that\\n\\nAnderson’s partial payments acted to revive the statute of limitation.\\n\\n      2. Anderson contends that Counsel are judicially estopped from seeking fees\\n\\ngreater than those awarded against her husband to her in the Modification Litigation.\\n\\nAnderson misstates how judicial estoppel functions, but nonetheless, this argument\\n\\nwas waived.\\n\\n      Anderson requested more than $79,000 of fees she incurred through Counsel’s\\n\\nrepresentation of her in the Modification Litigation prior to the appeal, but the trial\\n\\ncourt ordered her ex-husband to pay her, not Counsel, $42,000. Anderson now argues\\n\\nthat Counsel is judicially estopped from recovering fees in an amount greater than\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      23\\n           (Citations and punctuation omitted.)

We need not reach the merits of this claim because Anderson waived this\\n\\naffirmative defense by failing to assert it in her Answer.24\\n\\n      Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding that none of Counsel’s claims for\\n\\nattorney fees are time-barred. The record does appear to reflect that some work was\\n\\nperformed on Anderson’s behalf within the four-year statute of limitation.

GRAY v. STATE\\n\\n\\n        MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n        LaVante Pierre Gray appeals from his convictions for felony\\n\\nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony in connection with the death of James Jones.1 As his sole\\n\\nenumeration on appeal, Gray asserts that the trial court erred by\\n\\nrefusing to give his request for jury charges supporting the defense\\n\\nof justification. Even assuming that the trial court erred, we\\n\\n\\n        1 Jones died on September 1, 2017, and Gray was indicted by a DeKalb\\n\\nCounty grand jury on January 4, 2018, on charges of malice murder (Count 1),\\nfelony murder (Count 2), aggravated assault (Count 3), and possession of a\\nfirearm during commission of a felony (Count 4). Gray was tried before a jury\\nin July 2021 and acquitted of Count 1 but found guilty of Counts 2, 3, and 4.\\nThe trial court sentenced Gray to serve life in prison on Count 2 and to serve\\nfive years in prison on Count 4, to run consecutively to Count 2. Count 3 was\\nmerged into Count 2 for sentencing. Gray filed a motion for new trial on July\\n30, 2021, which was amended by new counsel on March 15, 2023. The trial\\ncourt denied Gray’s motion as amended on June 29, 2023, and Gray timely filed\\na notice of appeal. This appeal was docketed to the April 2024 term of this\\nCourt and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n conclude that any error was harmless, so we affirm.\\n\\n      1. The evidence at trial showed the following. 2 On September\\n\\n1, 2017, Jones and Gray were sitting in Gray’s car in Jones’s uncle’s\\n\\ndriveway when Jones realized his wallet was missing. Jones began\\n\\nsearching Gray’s car for his wallet, and at least one witness testified\\n\\nthat Gray assisted in the search. When the wallet could not be\\n\\nlocated, Jones asked if Gray had taken the wallet and then\\n\\nrequested that Gray empty his pockets. Gray denied taking the\\n\\nwallet but refused to empty his pockets. The two men began\\n\\ndiscussing the matter, which turned into an argument.\\n\\n      During the argument, Gray tried to drive away, but Jones got\\n\\ninto the car to stop Gray from leaving. As one witness described it,\\n\\nGray “tried to pull off, but [Jones] wouldn’t allow him,” and another\\n\\ntestified that Gray was “trying to back out to leave” when Jones\\n\\n\\n      2 Because this case considers whether an error in instructing the jury\\n\\nwas harmless, see Division 2 below, “we review the record de novo, and we\\nweigh the evidence as we would expect reasonable jurors to have done so as\\nopposed to viewing it all in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict.” Jones\\nv. State, 317 Ga. 853, 856-57 (2) (896 SE2d 493) (2023) (citation and\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n\\n                                        2\\n jumped into the car. The two men “tussled” over the car key, which\\n\\nwas in the ignition, when Jones grabbed the key and it broke in half.\\n\\nJones retained the electronic key fob that allowed the car to function,\\n\\nwhile the remainder of the key remained stuck in the ignition.\\n\\n     The car’s engine cut off at that point, and the car rolled into the\\n\\nstreet. The two men continued to argue. Jones told Gray that he was\\n\\nnot going anywhere until Jones got his wallet. While both men were\\n\\nstill in the car, Gray pulled a gun out of the driver’s side door pocket\\n\\nand ordered Jones out of the car while demanding his key fob. Jones\\n\\nexited the vehicle in response but did not give up the key fob. Gray’s\\n\\ncar would not restart after Jones got out of the car because Jones\\n\\nhad the key fob.\\n\\n     At some point, as the two men kept arguing, the matter turned\\n\\ninto a physical fight in the street, which did not last long and did not\\n\\nresult in any serious injuries, although Gray had a bloody lip and a\\n\\nblack eye. One witness testified that it was a “fair draw,” and\\n\\nanother witness testified that Jones got the better of Gray but he\\n\\nsaid no one was really hurt, just Gray’s pride. While the evidence is\\n\\n                                   3\\n somewhat conflicting as to when this fight occurred, most of the\\n\\nwitnesses testified that the fight happened after Jones took the key\\n\\nfob and was out of the car.\\n\\n     At some point after the car rolled into the street, Gray, along\\n\\nwith others, including Jones, pushed his vehicle out of the way of\\n\\nother traffic and positioned the car to allow someone to give his car’s\\n\\nbattery a charge. Jones stood in the street by the passenger side of\\n\\nGray’s car, complaining about Gray’s actions in a cell phone call to\\n\\nJones’s cousin, and continued arguing with Gray, who stood by the\\n\\ndriver’s side door demanding his key fob.\\n\\n     Then Gray walked around the front of the car, still demanding\\n\\nhis key fob, and shot Jones approximately six times. Gray continued\\n\\nshooting Jones even after Jones was on the ground. One witness said\\n\\nthat after the first two shots, Jones appeared to go toward Gray\\n\\nbefore he “buckle[d] down to the ground,” and another witness heard\\n\\nJones say, as he lay on the ground, “Don’t kill me.” That witness\\n\\nfurther testified that Gray continued firing even after he grabbed\\n\\nhis key fob from Jones. After getting the key fob, Gray drove away.\\n\\n                                  4\\n The witnesses to the shooting all testified that Jones was unarmed\\n\\nand that only Gray had a weapon. The witnesses denied having seen\\n\\nanyone remove a weapon from Jones after the shooting.\\n\\n     Jones was taken to the hospital by ambulance, but he was\\n\\ndeceased by the time police arrived there to question him.\\n\\nInvestigators did not locate a weapon at the crime scene, nor did\\n\\nthey ever locate the weapon used to shoot Jones. Jones’s wallet was\\n\\nfound five days later in a shopping center parking lot, where he had\\n\\napparently dropped it. Gray was arrested over a month later in\\n\\nOhio.\\n\\n     The medical examiner testified that Jones was shot six times.\\n\\nOne of the wounds was “definitely fatal” and several others were\\n\\n“very serious but potentially not life-threatening.” He said that the\\n\\nwounds reflected that Jones may have been shot while standing,\\n\\nalthough “an equally likely scenario” was that he was shot several\\n\\ntimes after he fell to the ground. The medical examiner did not see\\n\\nany soot or stippling around any of the wounds, so it was more likely\\n\\nthan not that Jones was shot from more than three feet away. Gray\\n\\n                                 5\\n did not testify at trial.\\n\\n     2. Gray argues on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing\\n\\nto give the jury charges he requested on self-defense because slight\\n\\nevidence was presented that he acted to prevent a forcible felony. At\\n\\ntrial, Gray sought a jury charge under OCGA § 16-3-21 (a), which\\n\\nprovides that\\n\\n     a person is justified in using force which is intended or\\n     likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if he or she\\n     reasonably believes that such force is necessary to\\n     prevent death or great bodily injury to himself or herself\\n     or a third person or to prevent the commission of a forcible\\n     felony.\\n\\nOCGA § 16-3-21 (a) (emphasis supplied). A “forcible felony” is\\n\\ndefined as “any felony which involves the use or threat of physical\\n\\nforce or violence against any person.” OCGA § 16-1-3 (6).\\n\\n     “Whether the evidence presented is sufficient to authorize the\\n\\ngiving of a [jury] charge is a question of law,” McClure v. State, 306\\n\\nGa. 856, 863 (1) (834 SE2d 96) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted), which this Court reviews de novo. See Reese v. State, 314\\n\\nGa. 871, 880 (2) (880 SE2d 117) (2022). “[T]o authorize a jury\\n\\n\\n                                  6\\n instruction, there need only be produced at trial slight evidence\\n\\nsupporting the theory of the charge.” State v. Newman, 305 Ga. 792,\\n\\n796-97 (2) (a) (827 SE2d 678) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). But “[e]ven when we find error in a jury charge, we will\\n\\nnot reverse when the error is harmless.” Jones v. State, 302 Ga. 892,\\n\\n897 (3) (810 SE2d 140) (2018). See also Hodges v. State, 302 Ga. 564,\\n\\n567 (3) (807 SE2d 856) (2017). “The test for determining whether a\\n\\nnonconstitutional instructional error was harmless is whether it is\\n\\nhighly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.”\\n\\nJones v. State, 310 Ga. 886, 889 (2) (855 SE2d 573) (2021) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Prior to trial, Gray submitted written requests for jury charges\\n\\non self-defense under OCGA § 16-3-21 (a), false imprisonment, and\\n\\nrobbery. During the charge conference, his counsel asserted that the\\n\\ncharges were authorized because at the time Jones was shot, he was\\n\\nengaged in committing two “ongoing” forcible felonies—robbery and\\n\\nfalse imprisonment—and that Gray shot Jones to stop the felonies\\n\\nfrom continuing. As for robbery, defense counsel argued that when\\n\\n                                 7\\n Jones suddenly snatched Gray’s key fob from his immediate\\n\\npresence, a robbery occurred and continued “as long as the parties\\n\\n[were] out there, and [Gray was] trying to reclaim the key.” Gray\\n\\nalso asserted that Jones was committing false imprisonment when\\n\\nJones told Gray that he could not leave until the wallet was\\n\\nreturned, then “beat” Gray, and stopped him from leaving in his car.\\n\\nDefense counsel asserted that this evidence showed that Gray was\\n\\nbeing detained against his will and that false imprisonment under\\n\\nthese circumstances constituted a forcible felony.\\n\\n     After hearing argument, the trial court denied Gray’s request\\n\\nfor a jury charge on self-defense based on the forcible felonies of\\n\\nrobbery or false imprisonment. The trial court later denied Gray’s\\n\\nmotion for new trial on this ground.\\n\\n     Assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in failing\\n\\nto provide a charge on self-defense to prevent a forcible felony, we\\n\\nconclude that it is highly probable that any error did not contribute\\n\\nto the verdict. The evidence against Gray was strong. Multiple\\n\\nwitnesses saw Gray argue with Jones over whether Gray had taken\\n\\n                                 8\\n Jones’s wallet. These witnesses also saw Gray fight with Jones and,\\n\\nafter the passage of some time, shoot Jones outside the car while\\n\\ndemanding the key fob; Gray then took the key fob and drove away.\\n\\nOne witness testified that Gray shot Jones twice, then stood over\\n\\nJones saying “give me my key,” while Jones said only, “Don’t kill\\n\\nme.” This witness said that Gray then grabbed the key fob and shot\\n\\nJones “like four or more times.” None of the witnesses saw Jones\\n\\nwith a gun, nor does Gray claim that Jones had a gun.\\n\\n     Instead, Gray claims that he was justified in shooting Jones to\\n\\nprevent Jones from committing two forcible felonies—robbery by\\n\\nsudden snatching and false imprisonment. But the evidence\\n\\nsupporting this defense was weak because any robbery had been\\n\\ncompleted at the time of the shooting 3 and the evidence did not\\n\\nsupport that deadly force was reasonably necessary to prevent the\\n\\nalleged false imprisonment. Under Georgia law, “[a] person commits\\n\\nthe offense of robbery when, with intent to commit theft, he takes\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 Gray does not contend that Jones took the key fob to steal his car, but\\n\\nrather to prevent Gray him from leaving until the wallet was returned.\\n                                     9\\n property of another from the person or the immediate presence of\\n\\nanother . . . [b]y sudden snatching.” OCGA § 16-8-40 (a) (3). Gray\\n\\nasserts that Jones committed this crime by snatching his key fob\\n\\nfrom his immediate presence, and further argued that the robbery\\n\\nwas continuing “as long as the parties [were] out there and [Gray\\n\\nwas] trying to reclaim the key.” However, this Court has held that\\n\\nthe “taking” element of robbery “is not a continuing transaction\\n\\nwhich ends only when the defendant leaves the presence of the\\n\\nvictim. Instead, the taking is complete once control of the property\\n\\nis transferred involuntarily from the victim to the defendant, even\\n\\nif only briefly.” Harrington v. State, 300 Ga. 574, 577 (2) (a) (797\\n\\nSE2d 107) (2017) (citation and punctuation omitted). See also Fox v.\\n\\nState, 289 Ga. 34, 36 (1) (b) (709 SE2d 202) (2011); James v. State,\\n\\n232 Ga. 834, 835 (209 SE2d 176) (1974) (“It is not required that the\\n\\nproperty taken be permanently appropriated.”).\\n\\n     Therefore, even assuming, without deciding, that Jones’s act of\\n\\nsnatching the electronic portion of Gray’s key out of the car’s ignition\\n\\nconstituted the felony of robbery by sudden snatching and that such\\n\\n                                  10\\n a crime is a forcible felony, that crime was complete once Jones took\\n\\ncontrol of the key fob such that a reasonable jury would likely\\n\\nconclude that the subsequent shooting (which took place after a later\\n\\nfight between Gray and Jones and after Gray moved and attempted\\n\\nto re-start his car) was not done to prevent the robbery. See OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-3-21 (a) (justification if defendant reasonably believes that force\\n\\nrequired “to prevent the commission of a forcible felony”). Cf.\\n\\nRobinson v. State, 298 Ga. 455, 462 (5) (782 SE2d 657) (2016) (jury\\n\\ncharge on self-defense in prevention of forcible felony addressing\\n\\nshooting death of defendant’s partner in crime by a third party was\\n\\nappropriate because the attempted robbery of third party was an\\n\\nongoing event at the time of the shooting).\\n\\n     Gray also asserts that Jones was engaged in the ongoing crime\\n\\nof false imprisonment at the time of the shooting. Under OCGA § 16-\\n\\n5-41 (a), “[a] person commits the offense of false imprisonment when,\\n\\nin violation of the personal liberty of another, he arrests, confines,\\n\\nor detains such person without legal authority.” Gray argues that\\n\\nthe crime of false imprisonment was a continuing forcible felony in\\n\\n                                  11\\n this case because Jones broke and took Gray’s key fob “for the\\n\\nspecific purpose of preventing him from leaving, thereafter\\n\\nthreatened repeatedly that [Gray] was not going anywhere, and\\n\\nfinally engaged in a fistfight with [Gray] causing violent injury.”\\n\\nEven if false imprisonment under these circumstances could be\\n\\nconsidered a forcible felony, 4 Gray was permitted to use deadly force\\n\\n“only if he . . . reasonably believe[d] that such force [was] necessary\\n\\n. . . to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.” OCGA § 16-3-21\\n\\n(a). The evidence that the shooting was necessary was weak. There\\n\\nwas no evidence that Gray was in any physical danger from being\\n\\nunable to leave the scene in his car, and the evidence supported that\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Although false imprisonment is a felony, OCGA § 16-5-41 (b), nothing\\n\\nin the text of the false imprisonment statute expressly requires the use or\\nthreat of physical force or violence against someone to commit the offense.\\nThus, it is not clear that false imprisonment meets the statutory definition of\\na forcible felony even if the false imprisonment is accompanied by threats. And\\nGray has not pointed us to, nor have we found, any authority where false\\nimprisonment has been defined, or treated based on the evidence presented, as\\na forcible felony under Georgia law. Cf. Patel v. State, 278 Ga. 403, 407-08 (6)\\n(603 SE2d 237) (2004) (no error in limiting the jury’s consideration of the\\njustification defense to the situation in which an attack was directed at the\\nperson of defendant and excluding a charge of self-defense based on burglary\\nas a forcible felony because “burglary is not ipso facto a forcible felony” as it\\ndoes not require the use or threat of physical force or violence against any\\nperson).\\n                                       12\\n Gray shot Jones, not because he reasonably believed that the\\n\\nshooting was necessary to free himself, but because he was angry\\n\\nthat Jones did not give up the key fob. Jones was unarmed, yet Gray\\n\\nshot him at least six times, and he kept shooting even after Jones\\n\\nwas on the ground. Gray then left the scene and was later found in\\n\\nanother state. See State v. Orr, 305 Ga. 729, 741 (4) (b) (827 SE2d\\n\\n892) (2019) (“[i]t is universally conceded that the fact of an accused’s\\n\\nflight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment,\\n\\nassumption of a false name, and related conduct [is] admissible as\\n\\nevidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.”) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     In other cases where the evidence of guilt was strong and the\\n\\nevidence supporting a justification defense was weak, we have\\n\\nconcluded that it was highly probable that the failure to give a jury\\n\\ninstruction on justification did not affect the verdict and thus\\n\\nconstituted harmless error. See Jones, 310 Ga. at 889 (2) (harmless\\n\\nerror to fail to charge on defense of self or third person because\\n\\n“evidence supporting a charge on defense of self or a third person”\\n\\n                                   13\\n “was meager at best”). See also Reese v. State, 317 Ga. 189, 197 (2)\\n\\n(891 SE2d 835) (2023) (where evidence supporting self-defense\\n\\ntheory was weak, failure to give justification instruction likely did\\n\\nnot affect the outcome of the trial); Munn v. State, 313 Ga. 716, 723\\n\\n(3) (873 SE2d 166) (2022) (defendant’s substantial rights were not\\n\\naffected by not instructing the jury on justification when evidence in\\n\\nsupport of the defense was weak). Just so here. Accordingly, Gray is\\n\\nnot entitled to a new trial on this ground.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

MONTE DAVIS v. LAND-RON, INC. et al.\\n\\n      In 2018, Monte Davis filed this negligence action naming multiple entities as\\ndefendants, including Land-Ron, Inc. and Intercontinental Hotels Group Resources,\\nInc. (“IHG”). Davis subsequently filed a motion seeking to substitute HH TRS FP\\nPortfolio, LLC as a defendant in place of IHG. On October 10, 2019, the trial court\\nentered an order dropping IHG from the case, but denying the addition of HH TRS\\nFP Portfolio, LLC as a party defendant. Davis then filed a “motion to add HHC TRS\\nFP Portfolio, LLC” as a party-defendant. The trial court entered an order denying\\nthat motion on December 10, 2019. To contest those adverse rulings, Davis filed a\\nnotice of appeal on July 6, 2023.1 As explained below, because Davis’s notice of appeal\\nwas not filed within 30 days of any appealable decision or judgment, this Court lacks\\njurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n      1\\n       In his notice of appeal, Davis states that “[he] files his Notice of Appeal from\\nthe Order Denying Motion To Substitute Parties, which was entered on October 10,\\n2019 and the Order Denying Motion To Add a Party Defendant, which was entered\\non December 10, 2019.” Similarly, in his appellate brief, Davis contends in the\\n“ENUMERATION OF ERRORS” section:\\n      1. The Trial Court erred in entering the Order, which erroneously denied\\n      the . . . Motion to Substitute Proper Party Defendant; and\\n      2. The Trial Court erred in entering the . . . Order, which erroneously\\n      denied the Appellant’s . . . Motion to Add HHC TRS FP Portfolio, LLC\\n      (“HHC”) as a Party Defendant.\\n                                           1\\n        “The proper and timely filing of a notice of appeal is an absolute requirement\\nto confer appellate jurisdiction on an appellate court.” (Citation and punctuation\\nomitted.) Perlman v. Perlman, \\n318 Ga. App. 731\\n, 739 (4) (\\n734 SE2d 560\\n) (2012). As\\na general rule, to obtain a direct appeal, “[a] notice of appeal shall be filed within 30\\ndays after entry of the appealable decision or judgment complained of[.]” OCGA §\\n5-6-38 (a). Here, the notice of appeal was filed more than three years after the\\ncomplained of orders were entered.\\n\\n\\n       Davis nevertheless posits that “this Court has appellate jurisdiction over this\\nmatter pursuant to OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1).” He cites that (defendant) Land-Ron, Inc.\\nmeanwhile moved for summary judgment; that the trial court denied that motion; and\\nthat this Court concluded in an unpublished decision that Land-Ron, Inc. was entitled\\nto summary judgment and thus reversed the trial court’s judgment. See Land-Ron,\\nInc. v. Davis, ___ Ga. App. __ (Case No. A23A0319) (June 9, 2023) (hereinafter\\n“Land-Ron I”). Davis asserts that, after this Court issued the remittitur,2 the\\nremittitur was filed in the trial court’s clerk’s office on July 3, 2023, and that he filed\\nhis notice of appeal on July 6, 2023.\\n\\n\\n       Even accepting, for the sake of argument, Davis’s assertion that his notice of\\nappeal was filed three days after the filing of the remittitur in the trial court, the notice\\nof appeal failed to perfect jurisdiction of this appeal. The statutory provision upon\\nwhich Davis relies authorizes direct appeals only from “final judgments, that is to say,\\n\\n\\n       2\\n        This Court’s records in Land-Ron I confirm that the remittitur was issued on\\nJune 27, 2023. See generally Young v. Jones, \\n140 Ga. App. 66\\n, 68 (\\n230 SE2d 32\\n)\\n(1976) (on motion for rehearing) (reciting that “this court will take judicial notice of\\nits own records, and will of its own motion, or at the suggestion of counsel, inspect the\\nrecords of this court in a former appeal of the same case”) (citation and punctuation\\nomitted).\\n                                             2\\n where the case is no longer pending in the court below[.]” (Emphasis supplied)\\nOCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1). Thus, even presuming that Land-Ron, Inc. was the sole\\nremaining defendant when this Court was deciding Land-Ron I, Davis has cited no\\nauthority supporting his premise that, after an appellate court reverses a trial court’s\\njudgment, a direct appeal may lie from the mere filing of the remittitur by the trial\\ncourt’s clerk’s office. And we find none.\\n\\n\\n      Rather, we are bound by Supreme Court of Georgia’s precedent explaining that\\n\\n\\n      [t]he trial court . . . was re-invested with jurisdiction when the Court of\\n      Appeals reversed [the denial of the motion for summary] judgment and\\n      caused its remittitur to be transmitted to and filed in the clerk’s office of\\n      the trial court. . . . The filing of a remittitur . . . served no function except\\n      to notify officially the trial court that its judgment[ ] had been reversed\\n      and that the case[ ] [was] being sent back to that court for further action.\\n\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) Hagan v. Robert & Co. Assoc., \\n222 Ga. 469\\n, 471 (1) (\\n150 SE2d\\n663\\n) (1966); see Holton v. Lankford, \\n189 Ga. 506\\n, 512 (1) (\\n6 SE2d 304\\n) (1939) (“The\\njudgment of reversal, without more, operated only to vacate the orders and the decree\\nas therein stated, and to reinvest the trial court with jurisdiction, on the filing of the\\nremittitur in the office of the clerk of the trial court. It did just this, and nothing\\nmore.”).\\n\\n\\n      As the Supreme Court of Georgia has explained further,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             3\\n       [OCGA § 5-6-103] declares that a decision of this court shall be certified\\n      under the seal of this court to the court below and shall be respected, and\\n      in good faith carried into full effect, by the court below. When the\\n      remittitur from this [C]ourt on the case’s former appearance here\\n      reached the trial court, the only action under our decision and judgment\\n      that the court below could take was to make the judgment of this court\\n      the judgment of the trial court and to enter an order [in accordance\\n      therewith].\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Summer-Minter & Assocs. v. Giordano, \\n231 Ga.\\n601\\n, 607 (\\n203 SE2d 173\\n) (1973) (citing former Code § 6-1804, which contained the\\nmaterial language of OCGA § 5-6-10).4 See generally Shepherd v. Shepherd, \\n243 Ga.\\n\\n3\\n\\n         See generally OCGA § 5-6-10 (“The decision of the appellate court and any\\ndirection awarded in the case shall be certified by the clerk to the court below, under\\nthe seal of the court. The decision and direction shall be respected and carried into full\\neffect in good faith by the court below. The remittitur shall contain nothing more,\\nexcept the costs paid in the appellate court.”).\\n      4\\n        Such principles are also set out in Giordano v. Stubbs, \\n356 F. Supp. 1041\\n, 1044\\n(N.D. Ga. 1973) (“Under Georgia law the decision of an appellate court must be\\nrespected and in good faith carried into full effect by the court from which the appeal\\nwas taken, \\nGa. Code Ann. § 6-1804\\n (1964), and generally the lower court fulfills this\\nobligation by promptly entering an order making the judgment of the appellate court\\nits judgment upon receipt of the remittitur. Such an order is known as a judgment on\\nthe remittitur. If the appellate court has reversed a lower court’s denial of a motion\\ndispositive of a case – such as a motion to dismiss (demurrer) or a motion for summary\\njudgment – the entry by the lower court of a judgment on the remittitur constitutes a\\nfinal judgment and terminates the case, whereas generally in all other situations the\\ncase continues in the lower court until final judgment.”) (citations omitted). And a\\n“judgment on [the] remittitur” is expressly recognized by Georgia’s cases such as\\nNance v. State, \\n274 Ga. 311\\n, 311 (\\n553 SE2d 794\\n) (2001), Yeomans v. Galbreath, \\n259 Ga.\\n261\\n, 261 (\\n378 SE2d 864\\n) (1989), United Cerebral Palsy v.

Ketcham, \\n259 Ga. 3\\n, 4 (6) (a) (\\n375 SE2d 848\\n) (1989).\\nHere, Davis has failed to cite – or even assert – that after the (presumed) filing of the\\nremittitur in the trial court, the trial court entered a final judgment in the case.5 See\\nOCGA § 5-6-31 (“The filing with the clerk of a judgment, signed by the judge,\\nconstitutes the entry of a judgment within the meaning of this article.”).\\n\\n\\n       Given the lack of any appealable judgment having been entered within the\\npertinent 30 day period before Davis filed his notice of appeal,6 jurisdiction of this case\\n\\n\\n353 Ga. App. 387\\n, 393 (\\n837 SE2d 533\\n) (2020), and Wilann Properties I, LLC v. Ga.\\nPower Co., \\n330 Ga. App. 311\\n, 311 (\\n765 SE2d 463\\n) (2014).\\n       5\\n        See generally Massey v. Massey, \\n294 Ga. 163\\n, 166 (3) (\\n751 SE2d 330\\n) (2013)\\n(“[A]n appellate court maintains jurisdiction over a case until it has issued the\\nremittitur and the remittitur has been received and filed in the clerk’s office of the\\ncourt below. Only then does the trial court regain jurisdiction to take further action\\nwith respect to the judgment appealed.”) (citations and punctuation omitted);\\nChambers v. State, \\n262 Ga. 200\\n, 201-202 (2) (\\n415 SE2d 643\\n) (1992) (“[W]here the\\nappellate court has issued the remittitur and it has been received and filed in the\\nclerk’s office of the court below, the trial court then has jurisdiction to take further\\naction in the case.”).\\n       6\\n         Our conclusion accords with other precedents requiring that a notice of appeal\\nbe filed during the 30 day period following a written final judgment. See, e.g., Seals v.\\nState, \\n311 Ga. 739\\n, 739 (\\n860 SE2d 419\\n) (2021) (“[D]ead-docketing a count leaves that\\n                                             5\\n in this Court did not vest.7\\n\\n\\ncount undecided and, thus, leaves the entire case pending in the court below. Such a\\ncase cannot be appealed as a final judgment under OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1)[.]”)\\n(punctuation omitted); Curry v. State, \\n248 Ga. 183\\n, 185 (4) (\\n281 SE2d 604\\n) (1981)\\n(“An oral declaration as to what the sentence shall be is not the sentence of the court;\\nthe sentence signed by the judge is.”); Bass v. State, \\n284 Ga. App. 331\\n, 332 (\\n643 SE2d\\n851\\n) (2007) (although the trial court announced at the sentencing hearing that certain\\ncounts would be merged with others, as to each guilty verdict, “the trial court did not\\neither (a) enter a written sentence, or (b) enter a written notation that the count\\nmerged into another”; the “case thus was not ripe for appeal at that time even though\\nthe trial court did enter a written judgment of conviction and sentence on other\\ncounts”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n      7\\n        There is no merit in Davis’s argument that the jurisdictional issue is controlled\\nby cases such as Gillen v. Bostick, \\n234 Ga. 308\\n, 310-311 (1) (\\n215 SE2d 676\\n) (1975),\\nColeman v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N. A., \\n347 Ga. App. 118\\n, 118, n. 1 (\\n817 SE2d 567\\n)\\n(2018), and Mitchell v. Cancer CarePoint, \\n299 Ga. App. 881\\n, 882, n. 1 (\\n683 SE2d 923\\n)\\n(2009). Those cases recognize that a prematurely filed notice of appeal may ripen\\nupon the subsequent filing of an appealable judgment; they do not provide further that\\nan interlocutory order “ripens” into a final judgment, upon the filing of a remittitur,\\nfollowed by a notice of appeal. Indeed, as noted above, this Court reversed the trial\\ncourt’s judgment in Land-Ron I, rendering the legal effect of “nullif[ing] the judgment\\nbelow and plac[ing] the parties in the same position in which they were before\\njudgment.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Franklyn Gesner Fine Paintings, \\n259\\nGa. at 4\\n (6) (a).\\n       What is more, it is pursuant to OCGA § 5-6-34 (d) that “all judgments, rulings,\\nor orders rendered in the case which are raised on appeal and which may affect the\\nproceedings below shall be reviewed and determined by the appellate court, without\\nregard to the appealability of the judgment, ruling, or order standing alone and without\\nregard to whether the judgment, ruling, or order appealed from was final or was\\nappealable by some other express provision of law contained in this Code section, or\\nelsewhere[.]” (Emphasis supplied.) But that provision may be invoked only where an\\n“appeal is taken from an order or judgment pursuant to OCGA § 5-6-34 (a), (b), or (c).”\\n(Emphasis supplied). At this juncture, Davis has not satisfied that predicate; nor has\\nhe made any claim that OCGA § 5-6-34 (d) provides a jurisdictional basis for this\\n                                           6\\n    Consequently, this appeal is hereby DISMISSED.8\\n\\n                                          Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\n                                            Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\\n                                                                        05/22/2024\\n                                                     I certify that the above is a true extract from\\n                                          the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\n                                                    Witness my signature and the seal of said court\\n                                          hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                            , Clerk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCourt to reach the complained of orders.\\n       8\\n         The appellate record does not contain a copy of the remittitur as filed in the\\ncourt below.

PITTMAN v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        BOGGS, Chief Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Randy Leon Pittman, Jr., challenges his convictions\\n\\nfor malice murder and arson in connection with the shooting and\\n\\nburning death of Natoshia Smith. Appellant contends that the\\n\\nevidence was legally insufficient to support his convictions because\\n\\nthe evidence failed to sufficiently identify Smith’s skeletal remains;\\n\\nthat the trial court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the\\n\\nDistrict Attorney; that the trial court abused its discretion in\\n\\nprohibiting him from asking witnesses about other fires that\\n\\noccurred while he was incarcerated; and that the trial court erred in\\n\\ndenying a motion for mistrial. We conclude that the forensic\\n\\nevidence and eyewitness testimony was sufficient to identify Smith\\n\\nas the victim and that there was no error in refusing to disqualify\\n the District Attorney based on the District Attorney’s prior\\n\\nrepresentation of Appellant, where it was undisputed that the prior\\n\\nrepresentation ended several years before, and was completely\\n\\nunrelated to, the murder prosecution. We also conclude that the trial\\n\\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of other fires\\n\\nbecause the evidence was not relevant. Finally, we conclude that\\n\\nAppellant did not preserve for appeal his claim related to the denial\\n\\nof his motion for mistrial. Accordingly, we affirm. 1\\n\\n      1.   Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdicts, the\\n\\n\\n      1 The crimes occurred on July 24, 2015. On November 14, 2016, a\\nHaralson County grand jury indicted Appellant for malice murder, felony\\nmurder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, arson in the first degree,\\nand possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The felon-in-possession count\\nwas bifurcated for trial and nolle prossed after trial. The indictment also\\ncharged Marie Southers with malice and felony murder and aggravated\\nbattery in connection with Smith’s death. Southers pled guilty to aggravated\\nbattery and testified against Appellant. At a trial from October 23 to November\\n1, 2017, the jury found Appellant guilty of the remaining charges. The trial\\ncourt sentenced Appellant to serve life in prison without the possibility of\\nparole for malice murder and a consecutive term of 20 years for arson. The\\nfelony murder verdict was vacated by operation of law, and the aggravated\\nassault count merged into the malice murder conviction. On November 10,\\n2017, Appellant filed a motion for new trial, which he amended with new\\ncounsel on January 29, 2021. After an evidentiary hearing before a successor\\njudge on February 22, 2023, the trial court entered an order denying the motion\\nfor new trial on March 17, 2023. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal, and\\nthe case was docketed in this Court to the term beginning in December 2023\\nand submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                      2\\n evidence presented at trial showed the following. Appellant and\\n\\nSmith were dating prior to her death. On the afternoon of July 23,\\n\\n2015, Appellant was at the home of his co-indictee Marie Southers\\n\\nwhen he learned from other friends that Smith had stolen items\\n\\nfrom the friends’ home. Appellant told Southers that he could not\\n\\ntake Smith anywhere without her “stealing, lying, or just\\n\\nintentionally making him look bad.” At Appellant’s request,\\n\\nSouthers telephoned Smith to ask her to come over, and then\\n\\nAppellant picked Smith up and brought her to Southers’s home at\\n\\nabout 3:30 p.m. When Smith arrived, she appeared to be high on\\n\\nmethamphetamine, and Southers asked Smith to go into a bedroom.\\n\\nAs Smith did so, she dropped a syringe full of methamphetamine on\\n\\nthe floor, which angered Southers because Southers’s children were\\n\\npresent. Southers told her children to go next door to their\\n\\ngrandparents’ home and then followed Smith into the bedroom, and\\n\\nAppellant walked outside to take a phone call. Smith told Southers\\n\\nthat Appellant had “forced himself on her” and forced her to do\\n\\ndrugs. When Appellant returned to the bedroom, Southers told him\\n\\n                                3\\n about Smith’s accusations. Smith accused Southers of lying, and the\\n\\ntwo women got into a fist fight, with Southers punching Smith three\\n\\ntimes in the face and then telling Smith to leave. As Appellant and\\n\\nSmith left in Appellant’s car, Appellant told Smith to lie down in the\\n\\nback seat so no one would see her with him.\\n\\n     Sometime after midnight, Appellant called Southers and said\\n\\nhe was at his father’s house and needed gas. Southers and her\\n\\nhusband took a one-gallon can of gas to Appellant’s father’s house,\\n\\nsaw Appellant and Smith in Appellant’s car, left the gas can by the\\n\\ncar, and then returned home. Several hours later, Appellant called\\n\\nSouthers and said there was an issue that they needed to discuss,\\n\\nbut he did not say what it was. Appellant asked her to come to a\\n\\nlocation on Coppermine Road and provided directions. Southers\\n\\narrived at that location about 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. and saw Appellant’s\\n\\ncar parked in front of an unoccupied and dilapidated house.\\n\\nAppellant was standing by the open front passenger door; he was\\n\\nholding a gun and trying to force Smith out of the car. The gun was\\n\\na “little 22” with a pearl-colored handle that Southers had seen\\n\\n                                  4\\n Appellant carry before. Appellant appeared angry and told Smith\\n\\nthat he did not know why she had to make him look bad all the time,\\n\\nthat he had done nothing but try to be good to her, and that he could\\n\\nnot take her anywhere. While pointing the gun at Smith, Appellant\\n\\nforced her to remove her belongings from the car and to walk into\\n\\nthe house. Southers followed and remained in the doorway of the\\n\\nhouse. Appellant was carrying a gas can that appeared to be the one\\n\\nSouthers and her husband had taken to Appellant. Smith pleaded,\\n\\n“Please don’t do this. You don’t have to do this,” and Appellant\\n\\nresponded that he had made her a promise, she knew what the\\n\\npromise was, and she knew that he was a man of his word. Appellant\\n\\nput the gun in his boot, grabbed Smith’s arm when she tried to walk\\n\\nout of the house, taped her arms behind her, put her on the floor,\\n\\ntaped her legs, dragged her across the floor, and yanked her to her\\n\\nknees. Smith again pleaded, “Please don’t do this.” Appellant then\\n\\nwalked behind Smith, and Southers heard the gun cock, saw\\n\\nAppellant point the gun at the back of Smith’s head, and heard the\\n\\ngun fire. Smith fell face first onto the floor. Appellant told Southers\\n\\n                                  5\\n to leave, and Southers drove home. About three hours later,\\n\\nAppellant called Southers, said “she’s dead,” and then hung up.\\n\\n     A few days later, Appellant came to Southers’s home and told\\n\\nSouthers that he had put Smith’s belongings on top of her and set\\n\\nSmith and her possessions on fire; that Smith was alive when he set\\n\\nher on fire; and that he threw the gun into Morgan Lake. He also\\n\\ntold Southers, “The more you kill the easier it gets.” In a later\\n\\nconversation, Appellant told Southers that he returned to the\\n\\nabandoned house two times; that a pill bottle that he had placed in\\n\\nthe fire had not burned; that the bottle contained a prescription label\\n\\nfor Smith’s former boyfriend, Matthew Hurston, and could point\\n\\npolice toward Hurston instead of him as a suspect; and that he put\\n\\nSmith’s phone in Hurston’s house. Appellant also said that he was\\n\\nworried the police would find his DNA in Smith’s body.\\n\\n     The crime scene was not discovered until August 29, 2015,\\n\\nwhen a man who had been looking for scrap wood found a skull and\\n\\nother bones in front of the home; he called 911. During the ensuing\\n\\ninvestigation, law enforcement officers collected multiple human\\n\\n                                  6\\n bones spread on the ground outside of the house, including a\\n\\njawbone with a metal plate in it and a skull with what appeared to\\n\\nbe a bullet hole in it. Several of the bones had charring on them. The\\n\\nofficers also discovered evidence of a fire that had burned through\\n\\nthe floor in one room of the house. Officers collected a partially\\n\\nburned medicine bottle for a prescription for Matthew Hurston from\\n\\nthat room. An investigator with the Haralson County fire\\n\\ndepartment concluded that the fire was intentionally set using a\\n\\nflammable liquid that had been poured between the entryway of the\\n\\nroom and the interior of the room. During his investigation, he\\n\\nsearched the ground under the hole in the floor and recovered\\n\\nhuman bones and hair, a necklace, and a piece of wire that appeared\\n\\nto come from an underwire bra. A forensic chemist testified that\\n\\ntesting completed on wood and carpet samples taken from the scene\\n\\nof the fire indicated the presence of gasoline.\\n\\n     Smith’s remains were initially identified by a dentist who\\n\\ntreated Smith in 2012 after her jaw had been surgically repaired\\n\\nafter Hurston had hit her and broke her jaw. At trial, the dentist\\n\\n                                   7\\n testified that the jawbone with the metal plate found on August 29\\n\\nwas Smith’s. The medical examiner testified that she compared\\n\\nante-mortem dental x-rays of Smith with post-mortem x-rays of the\\n\\njawbone found at the scene and concluded that the jawbone found at\\n\\nthe scene was Smith’s. The medical examiner also testified that the\\n\\nskull had a hole in it that was consistent with a gunshot wound, and\\n\\nshe recovered a bullet from the right side of the skull. The medical\\n\\nexaminer determined that the cause of death was a gunshot to the\\n\\nskull “with burning.” A firearms expert testified that the bullet\\n\\nrecovered from the skull was a .22 caliber. The gun that fired the\\n\\nbullet was never found.\\n\\n     In addition to Southers’s testimony, the State presented\\n\\nseveral witnesses who testified to inculpatory statements made by\\n\\nAppellant before the details of the crime scene were made public.\\n\\nOne of those witnesses was Adrian Williamson, who was\\n\\nincarcerated with Appellant in the Carroll County Jail before\\n\\nAppellant was arrested for Smith’s murder and who testified about\\n\\nstatements Appellant made to him in December 2015 or January\\n\\n                                 8\\n 2016. According to Williamson, Appellant related a story about a\\n\\nmurder in which an unnamed man shot a woman in the back of the\\n\\nhead with a pearl-handled .22 caliber gun and burned her. Appellant\\n\\nsaid that the woman had an ex-boyfriend who had broken her jaw\\n\\npreviously, but the ex-boyfriend had been in jail at the time of the\\n\\nmurder, and police cleared him. In connection with telling this story,\\n\\nAppellant asked Williamson how long DNA would stay in a body if\\n\\nthe body had been scattered by animals. He also said that “a guy”\\n\\nhad thrown a pearl-handled .22-caliber gun into a lake and that if\\n\\nthe gun was ever found, “I’m “f**ked.”\\n\\n     Investigator Bernie Reece, III, of the Haralson County Sheriff’s\\n\\noffice interviewed Appellant at the Carroll County jail. He testified\\n\\nthat Appellant said that he and Smith had dated until the end of\\n\\nJune 2015 and that the last time Appellant saw her was July 4 when\\n\\nshe and a friend dropped him off at his father’s house. Appellant also\\n\\nsaid that Hurston had told him that the police had cleared Hurston\\n\\nas a possible suspect.\\n\\n     2. Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to\\n\\n                                  9\\n support his convictions because the skeletal remains found on\\n\\nAugust 29, 2015, were not sufficiently identified as Smith’s\\n\\nremains.2 His argument implicates an essential element the State\\n\\nmust prove in a murder prosecution — “that the person alleged to\\n\\nhave been killed is actually dead.” Gude v. State, \\n313 Ga. 859\\n, 865\\n\\n(\\n874 SE2d 84\\n) (2022) (cleaned up); Reddick v. State, \\n202 Ga. 209\\n, 209\\n\\n(\\n42 SE2d 742\\n) (1947) (discussing element of “corpus delicti”). See\\n\\nalso OCGA § 16-5-1 (a) (“A person commits the offense of murder\\n\\nwhen he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or\\n\\nimplied, causes the death of another human being.”). Here, the State\\n\\npresented forensic identification testimony by two experts, as well\\n\\nas Southers’s testimony about Appellant’s actions on July 24 and\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Appellant summarily states that the evidence was insufficient to prove\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that “he was involved in any of the charged crimes.”\\nHowever, the only substantive argument he makes relates to the identification\\nof the victim. Because we no longer automatically review sua sponte the\\nsufficiency of the evidence, except that of murder convictions resulting in the\\ndeath penalty, see Davenport v. State, \\n309 Ga. 385\\n, 398-399 (\\n846 SE2d 83\\n)\\n(2020), we limit our consideration to the one argument that Appellant makes\\nin challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. See Scoggins v. State, \\n317 Ga.\\n832\\n, 837 n.6 (\\n896 SE2d 476\\n) (2023). See also former Supreme Court Rule 22\\n(2023) (“Any enumerated error not supported by argument or citation of\\nauthority in the brief shall be deemed abandoned.”).\\n                                      10\\n July 25. This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the\\n\\nverdicts, was clearly sufficient to authorize a rational jury to\\n\\nconclude that the skeletal remains found at the vacant house on\\n\\nCoppermine Road on August 29, 2015, were Smith’s. See Jackson v.\\n\\nVirginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n, 319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). See\\n\\nalso Lowe v. State, \\n288 Ga. 662\\n, 662-663 (\\n706 SE2d 449\\n) (2011)\\n\\n(evidence constitutionally sufficient to find appellant guilty of\\n\\nmalice murder in the death of her housemate where identity of\\n\\nhousemate, whose badly decomposed body was discovered in the\\n\\nwoods by hunters, was established by dental records and where\\n\\nappellant told a friend that she had fought with housemate, hit her\\n\\nwith truck, and watched her body fly into the brush on the side of\\n\\nthe road).\\n\\n     3.      Appellant contends that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in denying his motion to disqualify the Haralson County\\n\\nDistrict     Attorney   because   the   District   Attorney   previously\\n\\nrepresented Appellant in several cases when the District Attorney\\n\\nhad been a public defender. Appellant acknowledges that at a\\n\\n                                   11\\n pretrial hearing the District Attorney testified without contradiction\\n\\nthat the prior representations ended before 2013 and were\\n\\ncompletely unrelated to the murder prosecution, 3 but Appellant\\n\\nnevertheless argues that he need not show that an actual conflict of\\n\\ninterest existed under these circumstances. We disagree.\\n\\n     Appellant has cited no authority, and we have found none,\\n\\nsupporting the argument that a prosecutor’s prior representation of\\n\\na criminal defendant in a completely unrelated matter requires his\\n\\ndisqualification. Instead, in such cases, our precedent requires more\\n\\nthan the fact of a prior representation to mandate the\\n\\ndisqualification of a prosecutor. See Lyons v. State, \\n271 Ga. 639\\n, 640\\n\\n(\\n522 SE2d 225\\n) (1999) (conflict sufficient to require disqualification\\n\\nof district attorney’s office after defendant’s former lawyers were\\n\\nhired by district attorney must be more than “theoretical or\\n\\nspeculative” (cleaned up)). Such a conflict exists when “the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     3  One of the matters in which the District Attorney represented\\nAppellant resulted in Appellant’s conviction for theft by receiving. The State\\nagreed that this conviction would not be used against Appellant for any\\npurpose in this case.\\n                                     12\\n prosecutor previously has represented the defendant with respect to\\n\\nthe offense charged, or has consulted with the defendant in a\\n\\nprofessional capacity with regard thereto.” Reed v. State, \\n314 Ga.\\n\\n534\\n, 545 (\\n878 SE2d 217\\n) (2022) (cleaned up). See also Rules 1.9\\n\\n(“Conflict of Interest: Former Client”) and 1.11 (“Successive\\n\\nGovernment and Private Employment”) of the Georgia Rules of\\n\\nProfessional Conduct (“GRPC”) found in Bar Rule 4-102 (d). 4\\n\\nAlthough Appellant relies on Lemming v. State, \\n292 Ga. App. 138\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Rule 1.9 (c) provides:\\n\\n      A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or\\n      whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in\\n      a matter shall not thereafter:\\n              (1) use information relating to the representation to the\\n      disadvantage of the former client except as Rule 1.6 or Rule 3.3\\n      would permit or require with respect to a client, or when the\\n      information has become generally known; or\\n              (2) reveal information relating to the representation except\\n      as Rule 1.6 [Confidentiality of Information] or Rule 3.3 [Candor\\n      Toward The Tribunal] would permit or require with respect to a\\n      client.\\nRule 1.11 (c) provides, in part:\\n      Except as law may otherwise expressly permit, a lawyer serving\\n      as a public officer or employee shall not:\\n              (1) participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated\\n      personally and substantially while in private practice or\\n      nongovernmental employment, unless under applicable law no one\\n      is, or by lawful delegation may be, authorized to act in the lawyer’s\\n      stead in the matter[.]\\n                                       13\\n (\\n663 SE2d 375\\n) (2008), nothing in Lemming suggests that\\n\\ndisqualification   is   mandated        where   a   prosecutor’s   prior\\n\\nrepresentation of a defendant is completely unrelated to the charges\\n\\nat issue. Rather, in Lemming, the Court of Appeals rejected the\\n\\nargument that members of the district attorney’s office should have\\n\\nbeen disqualified from prosecuting the case after the district\\n\\nattorney, who had previously represented the defendant in\\n\\nunrelated matters, recused herself voluntarily. See \\nid. at 139-142\\n.\\n\\n     Here, the trial court found that the District Attorney’s prior\\n\\nrepresentations of Appellant were “indisputably unrelated” to the\\n\\nmurder prosecution and that Appellant failed to show that any\\n\\ninformation the District Attorney may have obtained during his\\n\\nprior representation “could be used in any manner to the\\n\\ndisadvantage of [Appellant] in the instant case.” Our review of the\\n\\nrecord shows that the trial court’s findings are amply supported by\\n\\nthe evidence presented at the pretrial hearing, and accordingly, we\\n\\nconclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\\n\\nthe motion to disqualify. See Neuman v. State, \\n311 Ga. 83\\n, 88 (856\\n\\n                                   14\\nSE2d 289\\n) (2021) (an appellate court reviews a ruling on a motion to\\n\\ndisqualify a prosecutor for an abuse of discretion, accepting the trial\\n\\ncourt’s factual findings if there is any evidence to support them).\\n\\n     4.   Appellant next contends that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in prohibiting him from questioning witnesses about\\n\\nother fires that occurred in 2017, arguing that such evidence would\\n\\nsuggest that another person killed Smith. This issue arose when\\n\\nAppellant was cross-examining the fire investigator, and Appellant\\n\\nstarted to ask about two fires that had occurred at the homes of\\n\\nSouthers and a defense witness after Appellant had been arrested\\n\\nfor Smith’s murder and remained incarcerated. Following the\\n\\nState’s objection and outside the presence of the jury, the fire\\n\\ninvestigator testified that the fires were still under investigation\\n\\nand that no cause had been ruled out. Following this proffer, the\\n\\ntrial court sustained the State’s objection that the evidence was not\\n\\nrelevant and ruled that Appellant could not question the fire\\n\\ninvestigator or other witnesses about these fires.\\n\\n     Appellant argues that the evidence was relevant because both\\n\\n                                  15\\n homes had a connection to Smith, with Smith having been present\\n\\nin Southers’s home the day before Smith died and Smith’s cell phone\\n\\nbeing found in the other home. Appellant asserts that because the\\n\\nState’s theory of the case was that Appellant set the fire to cover up\\n\\nthe murder of Smith, Appellant should have been able to ask about\\n\\nfires that occurred while he was incarcerated in order to suggest that\\n\\nanother person was the actual perpetrator of the crimes for which\\n\\nAppellant was on trial. For the reasons we explain below, this claim\\n\\nfails.\\n\\n         Evidence that a person other than the defendant committed\\n\\nthe crime is generally relevant under OCGA § 24-4-401 (“Rule 401”)\\n\\n(defining relevant evidence as evidence that has “any tendency to\\n\\nmake the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\\n\\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable than it\\n\\nwould be without the evidence.”). And relevant evidence is generally\\n\\nadmissible. See OCGA § 24-4-402. In cases decided under the former\\n\\nEvidence Code, we held that for such third-party guilt evidence to\\n\\nbe admissible, it “must raise a reasonable inference of the\\n\\n                                  16\\n defendant’s innocence, and must directly connect the other person\\n\\nwith the corpus delicti, or show that the other person has recently\\n\\ncommitted a crime of the same or similar nature.” Klinect v. State,\\n\\n269 Ga. 570\\n, 573 (\\n501 SE2d 810\\n) (1998) (addressing claim that\\n\\ncurtailment of cross-examination of witness about violent nature of\\n\\nco-defendant precluded defendant from showing that the co-\\n\\ndefendant committed the murder). Since the enactment of the\\n\\ncurrent Evidence Code, we have applied a reasonable-inference-of-\\n\\ninnocence standard of admissibility when considering the relevance\\n\\nof such evidence under Rule 401. For example, in Roberts v. State,\\n\\n305 Ga. 257\\n, 260 (\\n824 SE2d 326\\n) (2019), we explained that we have\\n\\n“followed the general rule that, before testimony can be introduced\\n\\nthat another person committed the charged crime, the proffered\\n\\nevidence must raise a reasonable inference of the defendant’s\\n\\ninnocence.” In Roberts, we held that the appellant failed to show that\\n\\nevidence he sought to admit to establish that a third person had a\\n\\nmotive to kill the victim was relevant under Rule 401 where the\\n\\nappellant did not identify the third person at trial and “offered\\n\\n                                 17\\n nothing more than speculation and conjecture” that a third person\\n\\ncould have been involved in the murder. \\nId. at 260-262\\n.5 See also\\n\\nPayne v. State, \\n314 Ga. 322\\n, 333-334 (\\n877 SE2d 202\\n) (2022) (rejecting\\n\\nclaim that trial counsel was deficient in failing to investigate and\\n\\npresent evidence that another person was the perpetrator, on the\\n\\nground that proffered evidence was not relevant because it did not\\n\\nraise reasonable inference of appellant’s innocence); Goins v. State,\\n\\n310 Ga. 199\\n, 207-209 (\\n850 SE2d 68\\n) (2020) (applying reasonable-\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 Neither Appellant nor the State asserts that Roberts and subsequent\\n\\ncase law improperly utilized the reasonable-inference-of-innocence standard as\\na specialized relevance test under Rule 401 in the context of third-party guilt.\\nNor has either party argued that OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) applies to third-party\\nguilt evidence, an issue we pretermitted in Roberts, \\n305 Ga. at 260\\n. We\\nrecognize that there is not a consensus view among federal courts about\\nwhether Federal Rule of Evidence 404 (b) is applicable to the consideration of\\nthe admissibility of third-party-guilt evidence. See Michael H. Graham, 3\\nHandbook of Federal Evidence § 404:5 (9th ed. Nov. 2023 update) (noting in\\ncontext of evidence of third party guilt that “the federal courts are in conflict\\nas to whether [Federal Rule of Evidence] 404 (b) applies to a ‘person’ who is not\\nalso the defendant” and describing the various approaches taken by federal\\ncourts). See also State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 556-559 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018)\\n(explaining circumstances in which Georgia courts consider federal case law\\nconstruing Federal Rules of Evidence in considering the meaning of our current\\nEvidence Code). Given that neither Appellant nor the State have argued that\\nwe should change course in addressing third-party guilt evidence or that such\\nevidence is governed by Rule 404 (b), we need not consider in this case whether\\nRule 404 (b) applies to third-party-guilt evidence or whether the reasonable-\\ninference-of-innocence standard for determining the relevance of such evidence\\nis an appropriate standard under the current Evidence Code.\\n                                       18\\n inference-of-innocence standard and laying out Rule-401 relevance\\n\\nstandard in addressing whether proffered third-party-guilt was\\n\\nadmissible).6\\n\\n     Here, the testimony that Appellant sought to elicit from the fire\\n\\ninvestigator and other witnesses does not raise a reasonable\\n\\ninference of Appellant’s innocence. Rather, the proffered evidence —\\n\\nthat two years after Smith’s murder, some unidentified person set\\n\\nfire to two occupied dwellings, which dwellings had a tangential\\n\\nconnection to Smith’s murder — offered nothing more than\\n\\n“speculation and conjecture” that this unidentified person may have\\n\\ndone so to hide evidence of that person’s involvement in Smith’s\\n\\nmurder and the arson committed at the scene of the murder.\\n\\n\\n\\n     6 In addressing the admissibility of evidence of third-party guilt, Goins\\n\\nand other cases have cited OCGA § 24-4-403 (“Rule 403”), which authorizes a\\ntrial court to exclude such evidence “if its probative value is substantially\\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\\nmisleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or\\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.” In those cases, however, we\\nwere not asked to review a trial court’s reliance on Rule 403 to exclude such\\nevidence. See Palmer v. State, ___ Ga. ___ (___ SE2d ___) (\\n2024 WL 923159\\n\\n*12; \\n2024 Ga. LEXIS 61\\n *36) (March 5, 2024); Goins, 310 Ga. at 207-208; Moss\\nv. State, \\n298 Ga. 613\\n, 616 (\\n783 SE2d 652\\n) (2016). We note here that the trial\\ncourt did not address Rule 403’s balancing test.\\n                                     19\\n Roberts, \\n305 Ga. at 261-262\\n. The proffered evidence did not establish\\n\\nthat arson was the cause of the 2017 fires, did not identify any\\n\\nperson who may have started the fires, and did not connect any\\n\\nspecific person to the murder or arson charged in this case. In the\\n\\nabsence of any nexus between the 2017 fires and a third party, the\\n\\nevidence does not raise a reasonable inference of Appellant’s\\n\\ninnocence. Thus, applying our precedent, the evidence was not\\n\\nadmissible under Rule 401 to show another person committed the\\n\\ncrimes for which Appellant was on trial. See Goins, 310 Ga. at 207-\\n\\n209 (no abuse of discretion in exclusion of evidence that appellant\\n\\nclaimed was relevant to show that other people could have had\\n\\nmotive to kill victim, where proffered evidence did not link any other\\n\\nperson to the murder or raise a reasonable inference of appellant’s\\n\\ninnocence and thus failed to meet basic requirements for\\n\\nadmissibility under current Evidence Code, including Rule 401);\\n\\nRoberts, \\n305 Ga. at 261-262\\n. Accordingly, the trial court did not\\n\\nabuse its discretion in precluding Appellant from questioning the\\n\\nfire investigator and other witnesses about fires that occurred while\\n\\n                                 20\\n Appellant was incarcerated.\\n\\n     5.    Appellant’s final enumeration of error states that the trial\\n\\ncourt abused its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial.\\n\\nHowever, Appellant failed to make his motion for mistrial\\n\\ncontemporaneously with the complained-of testimony, and thus, this\\n\\nclaim is not preserved for appeal.\\n\\n     Before trial, the State filed a notice of intent to present certain\\n\\n“bad-character” evidence, including evidence that Appellant boasted\\n\\nthat he had committed murder in 1994 and had been found not\\n\\nguilty of that murder. The admissibility of this evidence was\\n\\ndiscussed at two pretrial hearings. During the second hearing, the\\n\\ntrial court ruled, and Appellant agreed, that a witness’s testimony\\n\\nabout Appellant’s own statements would be admissible under Rule\\n\\n801 (d) (2) (A). See OCGA § 24-8-801 (d) (2) (A) (“Admissions by\\n\\nparty-opponent. Admissions shall not be excluded by the hearsay\\n\\nrule. An admission is a statement offered against a party which is .\\n\\n. . [t]he party’s own statement . . . [.]”) Appellant, however, indicated\\n\\nhe would object if a witness testified as to a belief that Appellant\\n\\n                                   21\\n previously “got away” with murder.\\n\\n     During the direct examination of Williamson, who had been\\n\\nincarcerated with Appellant, the prosecutor asked, “Did Mr.\\n\\nPittman ever brag about anything concerning the crime?” Appellant\\n\\ndid not object, and Williamson testified that Appellant had told him\\n\\nthat Appellant had committed a murder in 1994 and had been found\\n\\nnot guilty. According to Williamson, Appellant also said, “If you ever\\n\\nwant to kill somebody and get away with it, go to Haralson County.’”\\n\\nAppellant did not object to or move to strike the testimony; nor did\\n\\nhe move for a mistrial at that point. Instead, after the State\\n\\nconcluded the direct examination, Appellant stated he needed to\\n\\nmake a motion outside the presence of the jury. After the jury exited\\n\\nthe courtroom, Appellant moved for a mistrial, contending that\\n\\nWilliamson’s testimony that Appellant said he had committed\\n\\nmurder and been found not guilty violated the trial court’s pretrial\\n\\nruling and was “highly prejudicial.” The State argued that the\\n\\ntestimony was not in violation of the pretrial ruling, and the trial\\n\\ncourt denied the motion. The trial court later clarified that the basis\\n\\n                                  22\\n for its ruling was that Williamson’s testimony was admissible under\\n\\nRule 801 (d) (2) (A).\\n\\n     (a) It is well settled that a motion for mistrial must be made as\\n\\nsoon as the party is aware of the matter giving rise to the motion,\\n\\nand that the failure to promptly move for a mistrial fails to preserve\\n\\nthe issue for appellate review. See, e.g., Lee v. State, \\n317 Ga. 880\\n,\\n\\n884-885 (\\n896 SE2d 524\\n) (2023) (holding that “it is well established\\n\\nthat a motion for a mistrial must be promptly made as soon as the\\n\\nparty is aware of the matter giving rise to the motion” and\\n\\nconcluding that the denial of the mistrial motion was not preserved\\n\\nfor appeal where motion was not made until day after witness had\\n\\nfinished testifying (cleaned up)); Coley v. State, \\n305 Ga. 658\\n, 661-662\\n\\n(\\n827 SE2d 241\\n) (2019) (claim of error related to denial of mistrial\\n\\nfollowing admission of bad-character evidence was not preserved for\\n\\nappeal where the motion was not made contemporaneously with the\\n\\ntestimony at issue); Burrell v. State, \\n301 Ga. 21\\n, 26 (\\n799 SE2d 181\\n)\\n\\n(2017) (where State’s witness had emotional outburst on direct-\\n\\nexamination, defendant’s motion for mistrial made after the\\n\\n                                  23\\n defendant had completed the cross-examination failed to preserve\\n\\nthe issue for review). Because Appellant did not object to the State’s\\n\\nquestion, which clearly was intended to elicit the testimony\\n\\ndiscussed at the pretrial hearings, and did not move to strike\\n\\nWilliamson’s answer, and then waited until after the prosecutor\\n\\ncompleted the direct examination to make a motion for mistrial, the\\n\\nclaim that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a mistrial\\n\\npresents nothing for our review. See Coley, \\n305 Ga. at 662\\n.\\n\\n     (b) Appellant also asserts summarily that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion in admitting Appellant’s statement to\\n\\nWilliamson because his statement about the 1994 murder did not\\n\\nrelate to any of the charges in this case. However, Appellant failed\\n\\nto offer a contemporaneous objection to Williamson’s testimony. And\\n\\neven during argument regarding the motion for mistrial, Appellant\\n\\nasserted a different ground as the reason the testimony was\\n\\nimproper. At trial, Appellant argued that a mistrial should be\\n\\ngranted because Williamson’s testimony was “in direct contradiction\\n\\nwith what the Court ordered earlier.” However, as discussed above,\\n\\n                                 24\\n the trial court’s pretrial ruling was that any such statement made\\n\\nby Appellant to a witness was admissible.7 Under these\\n\\ncircumstances, where the basis for the objection at trial and\\n\\nargument on appeal are different, this evidentiary claim is not\\n\\npreserved for ordinary appellate review. See OCGA § 24-1-103 (a)\\n\\n(1) (a trial court’s ruling admitting evidence is ordinarily reviewable\\n\\nonly when “a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record,\\n\\nstating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not\\n\\napparent from the context”). Compare OCGA § 24-1-103 (a) (“Once\\n\\nthe court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or\\n\\nexcluding any evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not\\n\\nrenew an objection or offer of proof to preserve such claim of error\\n\\nfor appeal.”); Williams v. Harvey, \\n311 Ga. 439\\n, 447 (\\n858 SE2d 479\\n)\\n\\n(2021) (to preserve for appeal the violation of a definitive ruling on\\n\\na motion in limine, a party must make a contemporaneous objection\\n\\nat trial).\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 Because Appellant does not argue on appeal that the trial court erred\\n\\nin relying on Rule 801 (d) (2), we need not address this issue.\\n                                       25\\n      Even though Appellant does not argue that the admission of\\n\\nthis statement should be reviewed for plain error, we generally\\n\\nreview claims of evidentiary error under a plain error standard\\n\\nwhen a party raises an evidentiary error but fails to recognize that\\n\\nthe error was not preserved for ordinary appellate review. See, e.g.,\\n\\nState v. Kenney, \\n315 Ga. 408\\n, 413 n.10 (\\n883 SE2d 298\\n) (2023) (noting\\n\\nthat “we ordinarily review forfeited evidentiary arguments for plain\\n\\nerror”); Gates v. State, \\n298 Ga. 324\\n, 326-327 (\\n781 SE2d 772\\n) (2016)\\n\\n(adopting federal plain-error standard for reviewing claims of\\n\\nunpreserved evidentiary error under OCGA § 24-1-103 (d)).\\n\\nTherefore, we consider whether the trial court’s decision not to\\n\\nstrike   Williamson’s   testimony      about   Appellant’s   statement\\n\\nconstitutes plain error under the familiar standard set forth in\\n\\nGates, \\n298 Ga. at 327\\n (to show plain error, appellant bears burden\\n\\nof showing error that is clear or obvious; that was not intentionally\\n\\nwaived; that affected appellant’s substantial rights, which generally\\n\\nmeans it must have affected the outcome of the trial court\\n\\nproceedings; and that seriously affected fairness, integrity, or public\\n\\n                                  26\\n reputation of judicial proceedings). Appellant argues on appeal only\\n\\nthat the “statement about a murder in 1994 had nothing to do with\\n\\nthe facts of this case” and that “the trial court should have excluded\\n\\nthis testimony under a OCGA § 24-4-403 (b) balancing test.” His\\n\\nargument omits any substantive discussion about how the\\n\\nadmission of this snippet of testimony affected the outcome of the\\n\\ntrial. Given Appellant’s cursory treatment of the claim of error and\\n\\nthe overwhelming evidence of his guilt, including his own\\n\\nstatements, we conclude that he has failed to meet his burden of\\n\\nmaking “an affirmative showing that the error probably did affect\\n\\nthe outcome below.” Bozzie v. State, \\n302 Ga. 704\\n, 708 (\\n808 SE2d 671\\n)\\n\\n(2017) (cleaned up). Accordingly, there was no plain error. See\\n\\nWilliams v. State, \\n315 Ga. 490\\n, 496 (\\n883 SE2d 733\\n) (2023) (we need\\n\\nnot analyze all prongs of plain error review where appellant fails to\\n\\nestablish one of them).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 27\\n BOGGS, CHIEF JUSTICE, concurring.\\n\\n     I obviously agree with all that is said in the opinion. I write\\n\\nseparately to note a concern I have with the Court’s current practice\\n\\nof analyzing unpreserved evidentiary errors under the four-pronged\\n\\nplain error standard when the appellant does not assert plain error.\\n\\nWe have not addressed whether the current Evidence Code requires\\n\\nus to apply plain error review to unpreserved evidentiary errors, and\\n\\nI am skeptical that it does. The source of plain error review of\\n\\nevidentiary errors is OCGA § 24-1-103 (d), which contains no\\n\\ncommand — but rather gives courts permission — to review\\n\\nevidentiary errors for plain error, providing, “Nothing in this Code\\n\\nsection shall preclude a court from taking notice of plain errors\\n\\naffecting substantial rights although such errors were not brought\\n\\nto the attention of the court.” We have expressly concluded that\\n\\nplain error review is statutorily required in the context of jury\\n\\ninstructions. See State v. Kelly, \\n290 Ga. 29\\n, 32 (\\n718 SE2d 232\\n)\\n\\n(2011). See also OCGA § 17-8-58 (b) (“Failure to object [to a charge\\n\\nto the jury] in accordance with subsection (a) of this Code section\\n\\n                                 28\\n shall preclude appellate review of such portion of the jury charge,\\n\\nunless such portion of the jury charge constitutes plain error which\\n\\naffects substantial rights of the parties. Such plain error may be\\n\\nconsidered on appeal even if it was not brought to the court’s\\n\\nattention as provided in subsection (a) of this Code section.”); OCGA\\n\\n§ 5-5-24 (c) (“[T]he appellate courts shall consider and review\\n\\nerroneous charges where there has been a substantial error in the\\n\\ncharge which was harmful as a matter of law, regardless of whether\\n\\nobjection was made hereunder or not.”). I would welcome the\\n\\nopportunity to consider, with briefing by the parties in an\\n\\nappropriate case, whether our current practice of conducting plain\\n\\nerror review of unpreserved evidentiary issues when the appellant\\n\\ndoes not argue plain error is mandated by jurisprudential or\\n\\nstatutory concerns.\\n\\n     I am authorized to state that Justice LaGrua joins this\\n\\nconcurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 29\\n      PETERSON, Presiding Justice, concurring.\\n\\n     I join the Court’s opinion in full because it faithfully applies our\\n\\nprecedent regarding the admissibility of evidence that a third party\\n\\nmay have committed the crime with which the defendant is charged,\\n\\nand that precedent is not challenged here. I write separately to point\\n\\nout that at least some of that precedent may be wrong.\\n\\n     Division 4 of the Court’s opinion rejects Pittman’s claim that\\n\\nthe trial court erred by refusing to admit evidence that someone else\\n\\nset fires in the relevant area while Pittman was in prison. Pittman\\n\\nsought to use that evidence to argue that whoever set those fires\\n\\nmay have committed the arson-related crimes with which he was\\n\\ncharged here. In rejecting his argument, the Court applies a rule\\n\\ndeveloped under the old Evidence Code and that our precedent has\\n\\npreviously carried forward into the current Evidence Code. But I am\\n\\nuncertain that this rule was correct even under the old code, and am\\n\\neven more skeptical that we have properly imported it into our\\n\\ncurrent Evidence Code (and we have certainly never explained why\\n\\nthat old rule should still apply under the current code).\\n\\n                                   30\\n      Under the old code, we summarized this rule as follows:\\n\\n     Certainly a defendant is entitled to introduce relevant\\n     and admissible testimony tending to show that another\\n     person committed the crime for which the defendant is\\n     tried. However, the proffered evidence must raise a\\n     reasonable inference of the defendant’s innocence, and\\n     must directly connect the other person with the corpus\\n     delicti, or show that the other person has recently\\n     committed a crime of the same or similar nature.\\n\\nKlinect v. State, \\n269 Ga. 570\\n, 573 (3) (\\n501 SE2d 810\\n) (1998) (citations\\n\\nomitted). In setting out the test for admissibility, we cited only two\\n\\nCourt of Appeals decisions. See \\nid.\\n (citing Croom v. State, \\n217 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 596\\n, 599 (3) (\\n458 SE2d 679\\n) (1995); Bradford v. State, \\n204 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 568\\n (\\n420 SE2d 4\\n) (1992)). Croom, in turn, cited only Bradford\\n\\non this point. See Croom, \\n217 Ga. App. at 599\\n (3). Bradford cited a\\n\\ntreatise and three decisions of this Court. See Bradford, \\n204 Ga.\\n\\nApp. at 569-570\\n. But those decisions of this Court were all decisions\\n\\nreversing convictions on the ground that evidence of third-party\\n\\nguilt had been wrongfully excluded. See Walker v. State, \\n260 Ga.\\n\\n737\\n, 738-739 (1) (\\n399 SE2d 199\\n) (1991); Henderson v. State, \\n255 Ga.\\n\\n687\\n, 689 (1) (\\n341 SE2d 439\\n) (1986); Butler v. State, \\n254 Ga. 637\\n, 639-\\n\\n\\n                                  31\\n 640 (\\n332 SE2d 654\\n) (1985). And none of those cases articulated a\\n\\nrule like the one Bradford applied; rather, they appear to have\\n\\napplied a lower bar to admission. See, e.g., Walker, \\n260 Ga. at 739\\n\\n\\n(1) (mere “evidence enough to raise a reasonable doubt as to the\\n\\ndefendant’s guilt in the minds of the jury, not evidence sufficient to\\n\\nconvict someone else, would be enough to change the outcome of the\\n\\ncase and to warrant reversal”); Henderson, \\n255 Ga. at 689\\n (1) (same);\\n\\nButler, \\n254 Ga. at 640\\n (“the evidence as to [the third party] did tend\\n\\nto establish the possibility that [the third party] was responsible for\\n\\ncommitting the crimes[,]” and, therefore, “this evidence was relevant\\n\\nand admissible”) (emphasis added). 8\\n\\n      In any event, the language Bradford quoted from its chosen\\n\\ntreatise began with language that may at first blush seem similar to\\n\\n\\n\\n      8 Later in the opinion, Bradford also cited Stephens v. State, \\n261 Ga. 467\\n,\\n\\n468 (6) (\\n405 SE2d 483\\n) (1991), which held that the trial court erred by\\nadmitting a certified copy of the defendant’s prior conviction because the State\\nfailed to offer evidence that established similarity and a logical connection\\nbetween the independent crime and the crime for which the defendant was on\\ntrial. See Bradford, \\n204 Ga. App. at 570\\n. But a case about the admissibility of\\nevidence that the defendant had previously committed a different crime has no\\nobvious relevance to whether the defendant can admit evidence that someone\\nelse committed the crime for which the defendant is being prosecuted.\\n                                       32\\n our current OCGA § 24-4-403 (“Rule 403”): the “accused may\\n\\nintroduce evidence tending to show that another person committed\\n\\nthe crime with which he is charged . . . unless the probative value of\\n\\nthe evidence is substantially outweighed by actual risk of undue\\n\\ndelay, prejudice, or confusion.” Bradford, \\n204 Ga. App. at 569\\n\\n\\n(quoting 22A CJS Criminal Law, § 729). But our old code contained\\n\\nno provision identical to our current Rule 403, and a leading Georgia\\n\\ntreatise has observed that our Rule 403-equivalent approach under\\n\\nthe old code was materially different and led to excluding more\\n\\nevidence than the federal rule would. See Ronald L. Carlson &\\n\\nMichael Scott Carlson, Carlson on Evidence: Comparing Georgia\\n\\nand Federal Rules 121-22 (6th ed. 2018).9 In short, the only\\n\\nauthority that did any actual analysis and upon which we relied in\\n\\nKlinect did not apply a rule of evidence that the General Assembly\\n\\ncarried forward into our current code. See Bradford, 204 Ga. App. at\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      9That same treatise observed that Georgia cases decided under the\\ncurrent code regarding admissibility of third-party culpability have applied\\nGeorgia old code standards, and stated that “[f]uture decisions will determine\\nwhether Georgia will rely upon federal standards on this issue.” Id. at 118-119.\\n                                      33\\n 569-570.\\n\\n      Nevertheless, we uncritically adopted Klinect as applicable\\n\\nunder the current code. See Moss v. State, \\n298 Ga. 613\\n, 616-617 (4)\\n\\n(\\n783 SE2d 652\\n) (2016) (citing the test in Klinect). And since then, it’s\\n\\nbeen off to the races. See, e.g., Roberts v. State, \\n305 Ga. 257\\n, 260-261\\n\\n(3) (\\n824 SE2d 326\\n) (2019) (citing Moss and numerous old code cases\\n\\nto apply rule from Klinect under current code); Palmer v.

One case has at least suggested that the Klinect\\n\\nrule is consistent with Rule 403. See Roberts, \\n305 Ga. at 260-261\\n (3).\\n\\nBut the rule as we regularly apply it does not resemble the careful\\n\\nfact-specific, case-by-case determination that Rule 403 requires.\\n\\nInstead, it appears to approximate a categorical rule that evidence\\n\\nof third-party guilt must show a direct connection between the third\\n\\nparty and the crime in order to survive Rule 403, even if an indirect\\n\\nconnection could still show the possibility of third-party guilt.11\\n\\nCategorical rules of that sort did not survive the passage of the\\n\\ncurrent Evidence Code; it is “clear that Rule 403 provides no\\n\\nauthority for an appellate court to direct the exclusion of entire\\n\\ncategories of evidence.” State v.

In an\\n\\nappropriate case, we should consider whether our case law is correct.\\n\\nIn that event, we would also need to consider what, if any, approach\\n\\nfederal courts and especially the Eleventh Circuit had taken as of\\n\\n2011.12 See State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 555-557 (2) (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n)\\n\\n\\n      12 This question is beyond the scope of this concurrence, but I’ll offer a\\n\\ncouple of observations. First, it’s not clear that the Eleventh Circuit has a pre-\\n2011 holding directly on point. See David S. Schwartz & Chelsey B. Metcalf,\\nDisfavored Treatment of Third-Party Guilt Evidence, \\n2016 Wis. L. Rev. 337\\n,\\n409 (2016) (discussing approaches about third-party guilt evidence, citing for\\nEleventh Circuit approach only United States v. Johnson, 904 FSupp 1303,\\n1307 (M.D. Ala. 1995) (“Evidence that a person other than the defendant\\ncommitted the crime would certainly be admissible if it was exculpatory and if\\nit complied with the requirements of Rules 401 and 403.”)). Other district\\ncourts within the Eleventh Circuit continued to cite Johnson as authority on\\nthis point after 2011. See, e.g., Dorsey v. Hetzel, \\n2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154865\\n\\n\\n                                       36\\n (2018).\\n\\n      I am authorized to state that Chief Justice Boggs, Justice\\n\\nWarren, Justice Bethel, Justice McMillian, and Justice Pinson join\\n\\nin this concurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nat *33 (3) (a) (S.D. Ala. Sept. 6, 2013). Second, to the extent that our precedent\\nhas discussed Rule 404 (b) in the context of evidence of third-party guilt, the\\nEleventh Circuit has held that Rule 404 (b) does not apply to any person other\\nthan the defendant, such that evidence regarding the acts of other people are\\nexcludable only under Rule 403. See United States v. Morano, 697 F2d 923, 926\\n(11th Cir. 1983) (“Rule 404 (b) does not specifically apply to exclude this\\nevidence because it involves an extraneous offense committed by someone\\nother than the defendant.”); compare, e.g., Roberts, \\n305 Ga. 260\\n-261 (3)\\n(excluding the victim’s character evidence on relevance grounds without\\ndeciding whether Rule 404 (b) applied); Palmer, ___ Ga. at ___ (5) (to the extent\\nappellant attempted to show a third party’s “participation in the murders\\nbased solely on the fact that he had recently committed a crime of the same or\\nsimilar nature, the testimony that he sought to elicit was inadmissible\\ncharacter evidence” under Rule 404 (b) (cleaned up; citation omitted)); Goins,\\n310 Ga. at 207-208 (6) (discussing generally whether character evidence was\\nadmissible to support the defense theory that other people had a motive to kill\\nthe victim). Schwartz and Metcalf argue that the federal circuits are split on\\nwhat rule to apply to evidence of third-party guilt, with some following a rule\\nlike ours, while others simply apply Rule 403 as they would to any other\\nevidence. See Schwartz & Metcalf, supra, at 347-348, 358-359, 408-409. How\\nwe would go about deciding which conflicting line of caselaw to follow in the\\nabsence of Eleventh Circuit precedent is another open question on which I offer\\nno thoughts today.\\n                                       37\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9497886/pittman-v-state/'}),\n",

RAY TAYLOR v. KENNETH WILLIAMS.\\n\\n      Ray Taylor sued Kenneth Williams to recover for damages arising from a motor\\nvehicle collision. Williams did not file a timely answer or discovery responses. He later\\nmoved to open default and withdraw his admissions. The trial court denied the\\nmotion, ruling that Williams’s liability was established as a matter of law, but he was\\nentitled to a trial on damages. Taylor then filed a motion to enforce a settlement\\nagreement. The trial court denied that motion, as well as Taylor’s subsequent motion\\nto vacate the denial, and Taylor appeals. We lack jurisdiction.\\n      OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1) authorizes direct appeals only from “final judgments,\\nthat is to say, where the case is no longer pending in the court below[.]” Because the\\nissue of damages has not been resolved, Taylor was required to comply with the\\ninterlocutory appeal procedures of OCGA § 5-6-34 (b) in order to obtain appellate\\nreview at this juncture.1 See Underwood v. Dunn, \\n215 Ga. App. 252\\n, 252-253 (\\n451 SE2d\\n129\\n) (1994).\\n      In his notice of appeal, Taylor suggests that he may appeal directly under the\\ncollateral order doctrine, which “permits appeals from a small category of decisions\\nthat are (i) conclusive, (ii) that resolve important questions separate from the merits,\\nand (iii) that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the\\nunderlying action.”Expedia v.

CITY OF COLLEGE PARK et al. v. STEELE.\\n\\n      BROWN, Judge.\\n\\n      In this appeal arising from a granted application for interlocutory review, the\\n\\nCity of College Park (“the City”) appeals from the trial court’s order denying its\\n\\nmotion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to an insufficient ante\\n\\nlitem notice. For the reasons explained below, we reverse.\\n\\n      “We review the denial of a motion to dismiss de novo and, in so doing, construe\\n\\nthe pleadings in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, with any doubts resolved in the\\n\\nplaintiff’s favor.” City of Lafayette v. Chandler, \\n354 Ga. App. 259\\n, 260 (\\n840 SE2d 638\\n)\\n\\n(2020). Here, the pleadings show that in August 2021, a City garbage truck operated\\n\\nby a City employee backed into a vehicle occupied by Miriam Steele, injuring her.\\n Four months after the accident, Steele served an ante litem notice on the City,\\n\\nnotifying it of her intent to sue. The ante litem notice provided, in relevant part:\\n\\n      Amount of Loss Claimed: Miriam Steele has claims for her medical\\n      expenses of approximately $100,000.00 and a claim for her pain and\\n      suffering, mental and emotional suffering[,] and any other non-economic\\n      damages recoverable under all applicable laws in the amount of\\n      $20,000.00.\\n\\n\\nThe City filed a motion to dismiss Steele’s complaint, arguing that the ante litem\\n\\nnotice was deficient because it failed to include the specific amount of monetary\\n\\ndamages being sought. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the ante\\n\\nlitem notice stated Steele’s “willingness to accept $120,000 as compensation for her\\n\\nclaims.” In its view, Steele’s ante litem notice satisfied OCGA § 36-33-5 (e), which\\n\\nprovides: “The description of the extent of the injury required in subsection (b) of this\\n\\nCode section shall include the specific amount of monetary damages being sought\\n\\nfrom the municipal corporation. The amount of monetary damages set forth in such\\n\\nclaim shall constitute an offer of compromise. . . .”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n       The City asserts that the trial court erred in denying its motion to dismiss\\n\\nbecause Steele’s ante litem notice does not state “the specific amount of monetary\\n\\ndamages being sought” from the City. We agree.\\n\\n      A person seeking damages against a municipal corporation must give ante litem\\n\\nnotice, including the “time, place, and extent of the injury, as nearly as practicable,\\n\\nand the negligence which caused the injury.” OCGA § 36-33-5 (b). “Satisfaction of\\n\\nthis notice requirement is a condition precedent to bringing suit against a municipal\\n\\ncorporation. . . .” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Atlanta Taxicab Co. Owners\\n\\nAssoc. v. City of Atlanta, \\n281 Ga. 342\\n, 350 (5) (\\n638 SE2d 307\\n) (2006). “[T]he ante\\n\\nlitem notice provision of OCGA § 36-33-5 is in derogation of common law, which did\\n\\nnot require pre-suit notice[.] [I]t must [therefore] be strictly construed and not\\n\\nextended beyond its plain and explicit terms.” West v. City of Albany, \\n300 Ga. 743\\n, 745\\n\\n(\\n797 SE2d 809\\n) (2017).\\n\\n      In 2014, OCGA § 36-33-5 was amended to add subsection (e), see Ga. L. 2014,\\n\\np. 125, § 1, requiring the claimant to “include the specific amount of monetary\\n\\ndamages being sought” for the first time. Before the enactment of subsection (e), the\\n\\nGeorgia Supreme Court applied a “substantial compliance” standard to subsection\\n\\n\\n                                          3\\n (b) because “[t]he act recognizes, by the use of the words ‘as nearly as practicable,’\\n\\nthat absolute exactness need not be had.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Atlanta\\n\\nTaxicab, 281 Ga. at 352 (5). See also Owens v. City of Greenville, \\n290 Ga. 557\\n, 561-562\\n\\n(4) (\\n722 SE2d 755\\n) (2012) (considering whether ante litem notice substantially\\n\\ncomplied with OCGA § 36-33-5 (b)). Neither this Court nor our Supreme Court has\\n\\nexpressly addressed whether the former substantial compliance standard should be\\n\\napplied to subsection (e). See, e.g., City of Alpharetta v. Francis, \\n366 Ga. App. 454\\n, 456\\n\\n(1), n.2 (\\n883 SE2d 400\\n) (2023). We have, however, addressed whether substantial\\n\\ncompliance will satisfy the requirements of subsection (f), which the General\\n\\nAssembly also added to OCGA § 36-33-5 in 2014. See City of Albany v. GA HY\\n\\nImports, \\n348 Ga. App. 885\\n, 889-891 (1) (\\n825 SE2d 385\\n) (2019).\\n\\n      In City of Albany, we addressed the 2014 requirement that a claim submitted\\n\\nunder OCGA § 36-33-5 “shall be served upon the mayor or the chairperson of the city\\n\\ncouncil or city commission, as the case may be, by delivering the claim to such official\\n\\npersonally or by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery.” OCGA § 36-33-5 (f).\\n\\nWe concluded that\\n\\n      [i]f substantial compliance with subsection (f) was all that is required\\n      (i.e., service of notice on other individuals or entities associated with the\\n\\n                                            4\\n       municipal corporation other than those specified in subsection (f) would\\n      be sufficient), then there was no purpose in enacting subsection (f), at\\n      least not with the use of the directive “shall,” which is a mandatory\\n      command. In other words, to hold, as [the appellee] urges, that service\\n      of the ante litem notice on individuals or entities not specified in\\n      subsection (f) meets the requirements of the statute (although consistent\\n      with our “substantial compliance” jurisprudence interpreting the prior\\n      version of the statute), would render subsection (f) meaningless and\\n      mere surplusage. We “cannot by construction add to, take from, or vary\\n      the meaning of unambiguous words in a statute.” Accordingly, we hold\\n      that strict compliance with OCGA § 36-33-5 (f) is required.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) City of Albany, 348 Ga. App. at 891 (1).\\n\\n      Like subsection (f), subsection (e) also includes use of the directive “shall”\\n\\nwith regard to the requirement that the description of the extent of the injury required\\n\\nin subsection (b) “include the specific amount of monetary damages being sought\\n\\nfrom the municipal corporation.” OCGA § 36-33-5 (e). It appears, therefore, from this\\n\\nreasoning that substantial compliance with subsection (e) will not suffice, just as it was\\n\\nnot adequate for subsection (f) in City of Albany.\\n\\n      Nonetheless, even if substantial compliance were all that is required, “a notice\\n\\ndoes not substantially comply with subsection (e) unless a specific amount is given\\n\\nthat would constitute an offer that could be accepted by the municipality.” Harrell v.\\n                                            5\\n   City of Griffin, \\n346 Ga. App. 635\\n, 638 (1) (\\n816 SE2d 738\\n) (2018). For example, in\\n\\n  Davis v. City of Valdosta, \\n357 Ga. App. 900\\n (\\n852 SE2d 859\\n) (2020), this Court found\\n\\n  that an ante litem notice similar to the one at issue here failed to comply with OCGA\\n\\n  § 36-33-5 (e)’s specificity requirement. The notice in Davis “claim[ed] damages” for\\n\\n  medical bills “in [the] amount of $30,000.00” and general damages “in an amount\\n\\n  not less than $20,000.00.” Id. at 900. We explained that the notice merely indicated\\n\\n  that the value of the claim was some unknown number above $50,000 without\\n\\n  indicating the amount being sought, and concluded that “[a]n unknown number above\\n\\n  $50,000 is too indefinite to constitute a binding offer of settlement.” (Citation and\\n\\n  punctuation omitted). Id. at 901-902.\\n\\n          Here, Steele’s notice stated that she has medical claims “of approximately\\n\\n  $100,000.00” and non-economic damages “in the amount of $20,000.000.”\\n\\n  (Emphasis supplied.) By definition, an approximate amount does not set forth “the\\n\\n  specific amount”1 and also fails to provide “[t]he amount of monetary damages set\\n\\n  forth in such claim [that] shall constitute an offer of compromise.” OCGA § 36-33-5\\n\\n  (e). See also Tanks v. Nesmith, \\n359 Ga. App. 596\\n, 600 (\\n859 SE2d 559\\n) (2021) (rejecting\\n\\n      1\\n      Indeed, as the trial court noted in its order, Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines\\n“‘approximate’” as “nearly correct or exact: close in value or amount but not precise.”\\n                                            6\\n Tanks’ contention that “Amount of Loss Claim: $75,000.00, [and] Grady Memorial\\n\\nHospital bill in excess of $10,000” was an offer to settle her claim for $75,000 because\\n\\nthe notice added an unspecified amount in excess of $10,000 and made no statement\\n\\nwith regard to the total amount sought); Davis, 357 Ga.

HOWARD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n        Marquavious Howard appeals his felony murder conviction for\\n\\nthe 2017 shooting death of Jacorbin King. 1 Howard argues that (1)\\n\\n\\n        1 The victim’s first name was spelled “Jakorbin” in the indictment but\\n\\n“Jacorbin” in the trial transcript and the District Attorney’s brief on appeal.\\nKing was shot and killed on the morning of April 30, 2017. On January 30,\\n2018, a Muscogee County grand jury returned an indictment charging Howard\\nwith malice murder (Count 1), felony murder predicated on aggravated assault\\n(Count 2), aggravated assault (Count 3), and possession of a firearm during the\\ncommission of a felony (Count 4). Four others — Jylonda Jones, Samuel Jones,\\nTyler Teal, and Tramal Williams — were also charged with Counts 1-3, and\\nSamuel Jones, Tyler Teal, and Tramal Williams were charged with other\\ncrimes, as well. Tramal Williams testified at Howard’s trial that he expected\\nhis case to be transferred to juvenile court, while Howard’s other three co-\\ndefendants pleaded guilty to charges less than murder. At a trial held in May\\n2018, a jury found Howard not guilty of malice murder or the firearm count,\\nbut guilty of felony murder and aggravated assault. The trial court sentenced\\nHoward to life with the possibility of parole for felony murder; the aggravated\\nassault count merged. Howard filed a timely motion for new trial that was\\namended by appellate counsel. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the\\nmotion in an order entered on May 23, 2022. Howard filed a notice of appeal\\non June 22, 2022. Because the record transmitted to this Court was incomplete,\\nthe appeal was stricken from the docket on April 19, 2023. Upon transmission\\n the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions, (2) his trial\\n\\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress\\n\\nevidence of a photo identification, and (3) the trial court erred in\\n\\nexcusing a juror for cause. We conclude that (1) the evidence was\\n\\nsufficient, (2) Howard has not shown that counsel performed\\n\\ndeficiently in failing to move to suppress evidence of the photo\\n\\nidentification, and (3) Howard’s juror claim fails because he has not\\n\\nshown that the selected jury was biased or incompetent. We\\n\\ntherefore affirm.\\n\\n     The evidence at trial showed as follows. On the night of April\\n\\n29, 2017, a group of teenagers, including Tramal Williams\\n\\n(“Tramal”), Samuel Jones (“Sam”), and Tyler Teal, went to King’s\\n\\nMuscogee County apartment, planning to steal marijuana. Teal\\n\\ncarried a BB gun, and Sam carried his father’s firearm. At the\\n\\napartment, Tramal grabbed the marijuana and began to run out,\\n\\ncausing a fight that spilled out into the hallway. During the scuffle,\\n\\n\\n\\nof a more complete record, the case was redocketed to this Court’s term\\nbeginning in December 2023 and submitted for consideration on the briefs.\\n                                   2\\n Sam fell down a stairwell and lost some belongings, including his\\n\\nfather’s gun.\\n\\n     Agitated about losing the items, Sam began making phone\\n\\ncalls, asking for another gun and threatening to kill someone. Sam\\n\\ncalled his older sister, Jylonda Jones (“Jylonda”), who lived in\\n\\nHoover, Alabama, and asked for her help; she agreed to come pick\\n\\nhim up and asked her 21-year-old boyfriend, Howard, to accompany\\n\\nher on the approximately two-and-a-half-hour drive. On the\\n\\nmorning of April 30, 2017, Jylonda and Howard picked up Tramal,\\n\\nSam, and Teal in a white Toyota Camry and drove to King’s\\n\\napartment. Everyone went inside except for Jylonda. The group\\n\\ninitially came back to the car after being unable to find Sam’s\\n\\nbelongings, but then went back in a few minutes later after Howard\\n\\nnoted a bedroom door had been locked. After the group reentered the\\n\\napartment, King emerged from behind the locked bedroom door, a\\n\\nstruggle ensued, and Howard shot King multiple times.\\n\\n     Tramal testified that he saw Howard with a firearm magazine\\n\\non the morning of the shooting. Tramal testified that King “barged\\n\\n                                3\\n out into” Howard when King came out of the bedroom, then Tramal\\n\\nheard gunshots as he ran out of the apartment building.\\n\\n     Sam testified that he saw Howard with a handgun just before\\n\\nthe group entered King’s apartment for the last time. Sam testified\\n\\nthat Teal became entangled with King when King “bust out of the\\n\\n[bed]room[,]” and King made contact with Howard’s person, with\\n\\nKing “go[ing] for [Howard’s] mouth area.” Sam testified that he\\n\\npulled Teal off of King, then heard shots as he and Teal ran out of\\n\\nthe apartment.\\n\\n     Teal testified that he heard one shot while he was trying to\\n\\nbreak up a fight between Howard and King, then ran away. Teal\\n\\ntestified that Howard was the only other member of their group who\\n\\nwas in the apartment when the victim was shot. Teal testified that\\n\\nhe did not see Howard with a gun but saw him clutching his pants\\n\\nin such a manner that he could have been holding one.\\n\\n     Jylonda testified that she knew Howard to have a weapon\\n\\ngenerally. Sam, Teal, and Tramal all testified that none of the three\\n\\nof them had a firearm in the apartment on the morning of the\\n\\n                                 4\\n shooting.\\n\\n     A neighbor who heard the shooting, Rodrell Williams, saw the\\n\\ngroup entering and leaving the apartment building. The neighbor\\n\\nsaid a person matching Howard’s description was carrying a\\n\\nweapon, and was accompanied by three others who looked like “little\\n\\nkids.” Rodrell’s wife called 911 around 7:00 a.m. and testified that\\n\\nshe heard gunshots while she was on that call.\\n\\n     Surveillance video capturing the area adjacent to King’s\\n\\napartment building showed the arrival of a white sedan on the\\n\\nmorning of April 30, 2017, then a group of four young men twice\\n\\nwalking away from, then running back toward, the car. In their trial\\n\\ntestimony, Jylonda, Sam, and Tramal identified Howard on the\\n\\nsurveillance video as being part of the group.\\n\\n     A jail bunkmate of Howard, Merrick Redding, testified that\\n\\nHoward confessed to shooting King. According to Redding, Howard\\n\\ntold him that he rode to Columbus with his girlfriend to retrieve her\\n\\nbrother, then went to King’s apartment to retrieve a gun, shoe, and\\n\\nglasses that had been lost in a botched robbery, and that when King\\n\\n                                  5\\n burst through a locked door, Howard shot him multiple times with\\n\\na .40-caliber, FN-brand pistol. Redding reported that Howard told\\n\\nhim that King and Teal had tussled, and King hit Howard in the\\n\\nmouth. According to Redding, Howard first shot King in the side,\\n\\nthen fired more shots as King was falling, then finally, because\\n\\nHoward was upset about being hit in the mouth, Howard shot King\\n\\nin the head, firing a total of four to six shots.\\n\\n     A firearms expert testified that the shell casings recovered\\n\\nfrom the scene were consistent with having been fired by, among\\n\\nother possible types of guns, a .40-caliber FN handgun and had all\\n\\nbeen ejected from the same firearm. The expert also testified that\\n\\nbullets recovered from the scene, as well as two bullets recovered\\n\\nfrom King’s body, were consistent with having been fired by a .40-\\n\\ncaliber FN handgun and had all been fired from the same firearm.\\n\\nThe autopsy of King revealed four gunshot wounds, one in the head\\n\\nand three in the abdomen or torso, with at least one indicating a\\n\\nbullet entered the left side of the victim. The medical examiner\\n\\ntestified that the distance between King and the gun when it was\\n\\n                                    6\\n discharged could not be determined.\\n\\n     1.     Howard first argues that the evidence was insufficient to\\n\\nsupport his felony murder conviction. We disagree.\\n\\n     When evaluating the legal sufficiency of evidence, we view the\\n\\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdicts and inquire\\n\\nwhether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n,\\n\\n319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). “Under this review, we must\\n\\nput aside any questions about conflicting evidence, the credibility of\\n\\nwitnesses, or the weight of the evidence, leaving the resolution of\\n\\nsuch things to the discretion of the trier of fact.” Mims v. State, \\n304\\n\\nGa. 851\\n, 853 (1) (a) (\\n823 SE2d 325\\n) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     To support Howard’s conviction for felony murder, the evidence\\n\\npresented at trial had to show that he caused King’s death while in\\n\\nthe commission of an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. See\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-1 (c). The relevant portion of Georgia’s aggravated\\n\\nassault statute requires the prosecution to show that a defendant\\n\\n                                  7\\n committed assault “[w]ith a deadly weapon or with any object,\\n\\ndevice, or instrument which, when used offensively against a person,\\n\\nis likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury[.]” OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-5-21 (a) (2). The crime of assault in Georgia requires that the\\n\\ndefendant “[a]ttempt[ed] to commit a violent injury to the person of\\n\\nanother; or . . . [c]ommit[ted] an act which place[d] another in\\n\\nreasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury.”\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-20 (a). A jury may find a defendant guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt if the evidence shows either that he directly\\n\\ncommitted the crime or that he was a “party thereto.” OCGA § 16-2-\\n\\n20 (a). And a jury may infer a defendant’s criminal intent, and\\n\\nthereby find him guilty as a party to a crime, “from his presence,\\n\\ncompanionship, and conduct before, during, and after the offense.”\\n\\nWillis v. State, \\n315 Ga. 19\\n, 24 (2) (\\n880 SE2d 158\\n) (2022) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Howard appears to argue that the evidence (1) was insufficient\\n\\nto show that he directly committed felony murder, because the\\n\\nevidence did not show that he shot King, and (2) was insufficient to\\n\\n                                  8\\n support his conviction on a party-to-the-crime theory, given a lack of\\n\\nevidence that the group that entered King’s apartment the morning\\n\\nof the shooting planned anything other than retrieving a weapon.\\n\\nHoward does not challenge the evidence showing that he was in\\n\\nKing’s apartment when King was shot, instead arguing that the\\n\\nevidence was “insufficient to prove anything other than Howard was\\n\\nmerely present at the scene[.]”But there was ample evidence\\n\\nshowing that he was the person who shot Howard. Tramal, Sam,\\n\\nand Teal all testified that none of the three had a firearm, and they\\n\\nall testified that they either saw Howard with a gun or that he\\n\\nappeared to have one. This testimony was supported by the\\n\\ntestimony of King’s neighbor that he saw someone matching\\n\\nHoward’s description carrying a gun. Teal also testified that Howard\\n\\nwas the only other member of their group who was in the apartment\\n\\nwhen he heard King being shot. Moreover, Howard admitted to a jail\\n\\nbunkmate that he shot King in the head and torso with a .40-caliber\\n\\nFN pistol. And that account by the jail bunkmate was corroborated\\n\\nby ballistics evidence consistent with King having been shot with a\\n\\n                                  9\\n .40-caliber FN handgun and autopsy findings that King was shot in\\n\\nthe head and torso.\\n\\n     Howard also appears to suggest that the evidence was\\n\\ninsufficient to show that he shot King because the jury necessarily\\n\\nfound that he was not the shooter when the jury found him not guilty\\n\\nof the firearm possession count. But an acquittal on one count is not\\n\\nitself a basis to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to\\n\\nanother count. See Kolokouris v. State, \\n271 Ga. 597\\n, 598 (2) (\\n523\\n\\nSE2d 311\\n) (1999); see also McElrath v. State, \\n308 Ga. 104\\n, 108-109\\n\\n(2) (a) (\\n839 SE2d 573\\n) (2020) (noting abolition of rule that\\n\\ninconsistent verdicts warrant reversal).\\n\\n     Although Howard suggests that the evidence was insufficient\\n\\nto show that he had the requisite intent to be guilty of the crime of\\n\\nconviction, “[f]elony murder requires only that the defendant\\n\\npossessed the requisite criminal intent to commit the underlying\\n\\nfelony — in this case, aggravated assault, which also does not\\n\\nrequire intent to kill.” Mathews v. State, \\n314 Ga. 360\\n, 365 (1) (\\n877\\n\\nSE2d 188\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation omitted)). And the jury\\n\\n                                 10\\n could infer that Howard himself had the intent to injure King\\n\\nviolently when he shot at him multiple times, including in the head.\\n\\nHoward has not shown that the evidence was insufficient to sustain\\n\\nhis conviction.\\n\\n     2.   Howard next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for\\n\\nfailing to file a motion to suppress evidence of a photo identification\\n\\nof him by Tramal that Howard argues was based on an\\n\\nimpermissibly suggestive process. We disagree.\\n\\n     As memorialized in a video recording that is part of the record,\\n\\nTramal was shown a group of individual photos during an interview\\n\\nby investigators. He indicated, with some uncertainty, that one of\\n\\nthe photos looked like Sam’s sister’s boyfriend, whom he knew as\\n\\n“Quay” and had not met prior to the morning of the shooting. Later\\n\\nin the interview, Tramal was shown what appeared to be a one-page\\n\\nphoto array of six headshots, and definitively selected one of the\\n\\nphotos as “Quay,” stating affirmatively that he was sure it was him.\\n\\nA detective who interviewed Tramal and was present for the photo\\n\\narray presentations explained in his trial testimony that the initial\\n\\n                                  11\\n group of photos was taken from photos posted on Facebook, whereas\\n\\nthe second array included a driver’s license photo of Howard.\\n\\n     During Tramal’s trial testimony, both the individual photos\\n\\n(State’s Exhibit 71) and the one-page photo array (State’s Exhibit\\n\\n72) were admitted without objection. But when the State attempted\\n\\nto publish to the jury the individual photos that comprised Exhibit\\n\\n71 after their admission, Howard’s trial counsel moved for a mistrial\\n\\non the basis that, although he thought at the time they were\\n\\nadmitted that the photos had been provided in discovery, counsel in\\n\\nfact had “never seen these pictures before[,]” and a photo of Howard\\n\\nplaced Howard’s character in question because the photo showed\\n\\nhim making gang signs and holding cash, which counsel said\\n\\nsuggested Howard was a drug dealer. The prosecutor represented\\n\\nthat the photos had been provided in discovery and shown to defense\\n\\ncounsel just prior to Tramal identifying them for admission. The\\n\\nprosecutor said that although the photo of Howard showed him with\\n\\n“large amounts of money in his hand[,]” it did not show him making\\n\\ngang signs, and that the purpose of the photo was to demonstrate\\n\\n                                 12\\n how Howard was identified during the interview. The trial court\\n\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial but indicated “that particular\\n\\nexhibit” — specifically referencing “71C” — would not go out with\\n\\nthe jury, which defense counsel agreed “satisf[ied his] concern.”\\n\\n     Tramal later testified without objection that he picked Howard\\n\\nout of the photo array that was admitted as Exhibit 72. The detective\\n\\nwho interviewed Tramal also testified about Tramal picking\\n\\nHoward’s photo out of an array as Jylonda’s boyfriend. The detective\\n\\nacknowledged in his testimony that in viewing the original array,\\n\\nTramal said that he was not sure of his identification of Howard; the\\n\\ndetective noted that a hat Howard was wearing in the picture left a\\n\\nshadow on his face. The State played portions of the video recorded\\n\\ninterview of Tramal for the jury, although the transcript is not\\n\\nprecise as to which portions.\\n\\n     Tramal also identified Howard in court as Jylonda’s boyfriend,\\n\\nthe person he knew as “Quay.” In his trial testimony, Tramal also\\n\\nidentified Howard on the video surveillance footage from outside of\\n\\nKing’s apartment. Tramal described riding in the car with Howard\\n\\n                                 13\\n both before and after the shooting, saying the ride to King’s\\n\\nresidence took at least 30 minutes. The video appears to show that\\n\\nthe sun had begun to rise before the group arrived at the apartment\\n\\nbuilding.\\n\\n      Howard argues that trial counsel was ineffective when counsel\\n\\n“failed to file a motion to suppress the photo lineup” because the\\n\\nidentification procedure used by the detective when interrogating\\n\\nTramal was impermissibly suggestive.2 To prove his claim of\\n\\nineffective assistance of counsel, Howard must show that counsel’s\\n\\nperformance was deficient and that counsel’s deficient performance\\n\\n\\n\\n      2  To the extent that Howard made below separate arguments that\\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to review any particular photo prior to trial\\nor failing to object promptly to their admission into evidence, he has abandoned\\nthose arguments on appeal. Although he mentions those arguments in his brief\\nto this Court, he enumerates as error on appeal only that counsel was\\nineffective for failing to “file a motion to suppress the photo lineup.” This is\\ninsufficient to raise any such additional claims of ineffective assistance of\\ncounsel for our review. See Mims v. State, \\n310 Ga. 853\\n, 854 n.2 (\\n854 SE2d 742\\n)\\n(2021) (“An appealing party may not use its brief to expand its enumeration of\\nerrors by arguing the incorrectness of a trial court ruling not mentioned in the\\nenumeration of errors.” (citation and punctuation omitted)). Moreover, because\\nhe makes no substantive argument or citation of authority regarding trial\\ncounsel’s alleged deficiencies in this regard, we would not address such claims\\nof ineffectiveness even if they were contained in his enumerations of error. See\\nformer Supreme Court Rule 22; Session v. State, \\n316 Ga. 179\\n, 185 (2) (\\n887 SE2d\\n317\\n) (2023).\\n                                       14\\n prejudiced Howard’s defense. See Strickland v. Washington, \\n466\\n\\nU.S. 668\\n, 687 (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984). “If [a defendant]\\n\\nfails to establish one of these two prongs, we need not examine the\\n\\nother.” Payne v. State, \\n314 Ga. 322\\n, 328 (3) (\\n877 SE2d 202\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). “To show deficient performance,\\n\\nthe defendant must demonstrate that counsel performed counsel’s\\n\\nduties in an objectively unreasonable way, considering all of the\\n\\ncircumstances and in the light of prevailing professional norms.” Id.\\n\\nat 328-329 (3) (citation omitted). “To establish prejudice, [a\\n\\ndefendant] must show that there is a reasonable probability that,\\n\\nbut for counsel’s unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding\\n\\nwould have been different.” Id. at 329 (3) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). “In reviewing a ruling on a claim of ineffective assistance\\n\\nof counsel, we defer to the trial court’s findings of fact unless they\\n\\nare clearly erroneous, but we apply the law to the facts de novo.” Id.\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     When a defendant claims that his counsel was ineffective for\\n\\nfailing to file a motion to suppress evidence, he cannot show that his\\n\\n                                 15\\n counsel performed deficiently unless he can show that the motion\\n\\nwould have been granted. See Armour v. State, \\n290 Ga. 553\\n, 554-555\\n\\n(2) (a) (\\n722 SE2d 751\\n) (2012) (appellant failed to establish deficient\\n\\nperformance where he failed to show that an objection to certain\\n\\neyewitness identifications of him during photo arrays would have\\n\\nbeen sustained). A motion to suppress an out-of-court identification\\n\\nby a witness as impermissibly suggestive in violation of due process\\n\\n— the motion that Howard contends his counsel should have filed —\\n\\nrequires a showing that the identification was “so impermissibly\\n\\nsuggestive that it could result in a substantial likelihood of\\n\\nmisidentification[.]” Lewis v. State, \\n314 Ga. 654\\n, 662 (3) (b) (\\n878\\n\\nSE2d 467\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation omitted). We employ a\\n\\ntwo-step process to determine whether identification evidence meets\\n\\nthat test. See \\nid.\\n “First, we decide whether the identification\\n\\nprocedure used was impermissibly suggestive.” \\nId.\\n (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). “Second, if a trial court properly concludes\\n\\nthat the State employed an impermissibly suggestive pre-trial\\n\\nidentification procedure, the issue becomes whether, considering the\\n\\n                                 16\\n totality of the circumstances, there was a substantial likelihood of\\n\\nirreparable   misidentification.”    \\nId.\\n   (citation   and    punctuation\\n\\nomitted). “If, however, a trial court properly determines that the\\n\\nidentification procedure is not unduly suggestive, it is not necessary\\n\\nto consider whether there was a substantial likelihood of irreparable\\n\\nmisidentification.” \\nId.\\n (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, whether or not the photo identification procedure used\\n\\nwith Tramal was impermissibly suggestive, we conclude that\\n\\nHoward has not shown that there was a substantial likelihood of\\n\\nirreparable misidentification, such that a motion to suppress the\\n\\nphoto identification evidence would have succeeded. See Newton v.\\n\\nState, \\n308 Ga. 863\\n, 863, 867 (2) (\\n843 SE2d 857\\n) (2020) (concluding\\n\\nthat, even assuming photo array was impermissibly suggestive,\\n\\ndefendant had not shown a substantial likelihood of irreparable\\n\\nmisidentification, and thus trial court did not err in denying motion\\n\\nto   suppress).   In   evaluating    the    likelihood   of   irreparable\\n\\nmisidentification, a court considers whether, under the totality of\\n\\nthe circumstances, the identification is reliable. See id. at 867 (2).\\n\\n                                    17\\n Factors to consider include (1) a witness’s opportunity to view the\\n\\naccused at the time of the crime; (2) the witness’s degree of attention;\\n\\n(3) the accuracy of the witness’s prior description of the accused; (4)\\n\\nthe witness’s level of certainty at the confrontation; and (5) the\\n\\nlength of time between the crime and the confrontation. See id.\\n\\n     Here, Howard argues that because Tramal had not met him\\n\\nprior to the day of the shooting, the likelihood of misidentification\\n\\nwas higher. But Howard does not grapple with the evidence showing\\n\\nthat Tramal had a significant opportunity to view him before and\\n\\nafter the shooting. As noted above, Howard and Tramal rode\\n\\ntogether in a car both before and after the shooting, a journey that\\n\\nwas at least 30 minutes each way. As demonstrated by the\\n\\nsurveillance video, Tramal would have had the opportunity to view\\n\\nHoward in daylight at least by the time that they arrived at King’s\\n\\napartment. Tramal and Howard also went into King’s apartment\\n\\ntwice together. And Tramal expressed certainty in identifying\\n\\nHoward in the second, one-page photo array. The extensive\\n\\nopportunities for Tramal to view Howard, as well as the certainty\\n\\n                                  18\\n with which he ultimately identified Howard, greatly lessened the\\n\\nlikelihood that any suggestiveness in the initial photo array\\n\\ninfluenced the reliability of Tramal’s subsequent identifications of\\n\\nHoward. See Curry v. State, \\n305 Ga. 73\\n, 77 (2) (\\n823 SE2d 758\\n) (2019)\\n\\n(despite   trial   court’s   conclusion   that   State   employed    an\\n\\nimpermissibly suggestive pretrial identification procedure with\\n\\nbystander witnesses, no abuse of discretion in overruling objection\\n\\nto identification evidence, given factors such as witnesses’ “adequate\\n\\nopportunity in full daylight” to view the defendant and high level of\\n\\ncertainty of identifications at the time of trial); Wright v. State, \\n294\\n\\nGa. 798\\n, 800, 802-803 (2) (\\n756 SE2d 513\\n) (2014) (rejecting argument\\n\\nthat in-court identification should have been excluded for\\n\\nsubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, even though\\n\\nwitness had not seen the shooter prior to the night of the shooting\\n\\nand was unable to select defendant definitively from photo array,\\n\\nwhere witness had sufficient opportunity to observe shooter, gave\\n\\nfairly accurate description of gunman, and testified that he was 95\\n\\npercent certain of his identification). And although Tramal was\\n\\n                                   19\\n hesitant about identifying Howard in the initial photo array, the\\n\\nuncontested evidence is that Howard was wearing a hat that cast a\\n\\nshadow on his face in this photo, both explaining Tramal’s hesitance\\n\\nabout identifying him from that photo and making it less likely that\\n\\nthe viewing of this photo influenced Tramal’s subsequent, more\\n\\ncertain identifications of Howard. Having failed to show that an\\n\\nobjection to Tramal’s identification of Howard would have been\\n\\nsuccessful, Howard has failed to establish deficient performance by\\n\\nhis trial counsel for not filing a motion to suppress, so Howard’s\\n\\nclaim fails on the first prong of the ineffective assistance test. See\\n\\nPearson v. State, \\n311 Ga. 26\\n, 29-31 (2) (\\n855 SE2d 606\\n) (2021) (no\\n\\ndeficient performance in failing to secure ruling on motion to\\n\\nsuppress identifications where totality of the circumstances did not\\n\\nshow that the trial court would have found a substantial likelihood\\n\\nof misidentification); see also Walker v. State, \\n295 Ga. 688\\n, 692-693\\n\\n(3) (\\n763 SE2d 704\\n) (2014) (equating the admissibility of in-court\\n\\nidentification with whether suggestive out-of-court identification\\n\\nleads to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification).\\n\\n                                  20\\n      3.    Finally, Howard argues that the trial court erred in\\n\\nstriking a prospective juror for cause. We conclude that Howard has\\n\\nnot shown reversible error.\\n\\n     During voir dire, in response to the State’s question of whether\\n\\nany member of the panel “may have some moral or religious or\\n\\nphilosophical beliefs that would prevent you from sitting in\\n\\njudgment of another person,” Juror No. 18 said she did not “feel\\n\\ncomfortable judging” and did not “feel comfortable making the\\n\\njudgment on someone else’s situation.” She added, “I just feel like I\\n\\npray that — for everyone and I just think that God is going to make\\n\\neverybody better. But it doesn’t always happen that way, but I still\\n\\npray for them.” During follow up questioning, Juror No. 18 stated\\n\\nthat she would follow the trial court’s instructions, “listen to all the\\n\\nevidence[,] and follow what the [j]udge told [her] to do[,]” and she\\n\\ntold the prosecutor that if she “fe[lt] “that [the] evidence [was] strong\\n\\nenough, then it would have to be a guilty verdict.” But she also\\n\\nexpressed concern about “holding the young man’s life in [her]\\n\\nhands[,]” noting she had five grandsons. And when the prosecutor\\n\\n                                   21\\n pressed her on whether she could “set aside” her “moral belief” and\\n\\nthoughts about her grandsons and “decide this case without all of\\n\\nthat influencing [her,]” Juror No. 18 responded, “I don’t think I could\\n\\ndo that. I really don’t.” The State moved to strike Juror No. 18 for\\n\\ncause. Howard’s counsel responded that the prospective juror should\\n\\nnot be struck, noting her statements that she would follow\\n\\ninstructions and vote guilty if the evidence were strong enough. The\\n\\nState argued in turn that “her initial response and her final response\\n\\nclearly indicates that she has so much compassion and cannot set\\n\\naside her moral convictions[.]”The trial court granted the State’s\\n\\nmotion to strike, saying, “I’m kind of falling back on primacy and\\n\\nrecency on this one.” Howard did not further object to the striking of\\n\\nthe juror.3\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 The Attorney General argues that this claim is not preserved. But the\\n\\ncases that the Attorney General cites do not address whether a defendant\\nneeds to restate an objection to excusing a juror for cause once the court has\\nruled. See Hill v. State, \\n310 Ga. 180\\n, 186-187 (3) (a) (\\n850 SE2d 110\\n) (2020);\\nPassmore v. State, \\n274 Ga. 200\\n, 202 (5) (\\n552 SE2d 816\\n) (2001). And our\\nprecedent indicates that a defendant does not need to restate such an objection.\\nSee Humphreys v. State, \\n287 Ga. 63\\n, 69 (4) (\\n694 SE2d 316\\n) (2010), disapproved\\non other grounds by Willis v. State, \\n304 Ga. 686\\n, 706-707 (11) (a) n.3 (\\n820 SE2d\\n640\\n) (2018).\\n                                      22\\n      Whether or not the trial court abused its discretion in striking\\n\\nJuror No. 18, Howard’s claim provides no grounds for reversal. “It is\\n\\nwell settled that a defendant does not have a right in a particular\\n\\njuror but rather only has a right to a legal and impartial jury[.]”\\n\\nSaylor v. State, \\n316 Ga. 225\\n, 232-233 (3) (\\n887 SE2d 329\\n) (2023). The\\n\\nerroneous dismissal for cause of a prospective juror for a reason that\\n\\nis not constitutionally impermissible does not require reversal “if\\n\\nthere is no showing that a competent and unbiased jury was not\\n\\nselected.” Id. at 233 (3). Howard does not argue that the jury that\\n\\nwas selected was biased or incompetent. Accordingly, his claim fails.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

Bolton, Attorney General, Rubye G. Jackson, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.\\nCANDLER, Presiding Justice.\\nHarold A. Wiggins was indicted in DeKalb County for the murder of Mildred Wiggins, his wife. The indictment alleges that he killed her by striking and beating her with his hands and fists. He was convicted of the offense charged. The jury recommended mercy and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He filed a motion for new trial on the usual general grounds only. His motion was overruled and a new trial denied him on August 13, 1965. He timely appealed his case to this court and the only error enumerated by him is that the evidence was insufficient to support a murder verdict. Held:\\nVoluntary drunkenness is no excuse or justification for crime. Code § 26-403. On his trial the defendant offered no evidence but made an unsworn statement in which he said that he was unable to remember the commission of any act by him which might have produced or caused the death of his wife. The evidence introduced by the State is lengthy but in substance shows: The defendant and his wife attended a New Year\\'s Eve party at a neighbor\\'s apartment about 200 feet from their apartment. They arrived at the party about 9:30 p. m. From the time they reached the party, the defendant took a drink of whiskey every 30 minutes until he left at 3 a. m. Just before leaving the party, the defendant for some unknown reason grabbed the front of his wife\\'s sweater and started toward their apartment. In going to their apartment they fell down a slope and witnesses testified that they saw *610 him striking her with his hands and that they wrestled and fought on the ground. Linda Marie Evans who saw Mrs. Wiggins in her apartment at 8 a. m. on the morning following the New Year\\'s Eve party testified that she was badly beaten and bruised all over, especially on the head, neck and arms; that there was blood and hair on the wall of her apartment and blood on the floors of all the rooms; that the defendant said he had beaten his wife from one end of the house to the other; that he took three drinks of whiskey while she was there; that he had a gun in his right pocket and said that he had \"a good mind to go back in there and kill her\"; and that she told him he was in no condition to go to work. She further testified that she called an ambulance and Mrs. Wiggins was carried to the DeKalb General Hospital where she died five days later. Mr. Dainey Batson, Sr. testified that he was the father of Mrs. Wiggins; that the defendant called him about 4 a. m. on January 1 and said: \"Pop, Mildred [the deceased] is drunk and bleeding, lying in the floor\"; and that his daughter (Mrs. Wiggins) came to the telephone and said: \"Pop, I am not drunk, Harold has beat me to death.\" Dr. Ernest L. Park, Jr., a witness for the State, testified that he had been the defendant\\'s family physician for some time and knew his wife well, having delivered her last baby; that he saw her about 9:30 a. m. on January 1 in the emergency room at DeKalb General Hospital; that she was at that time so beaten, bruised, swollen and discolored that he did not recognize her; that from an examination of her body he found multiple bruises, especially on her neck, head and arms; that her scalp had in several places separated from her skull; that the accused several times asked him about her condition and he informed him that she had been so severely beaten that she could not recover; and that her physical condition grew progressively worse until her death 5 days later. Dr. Ellis B. Keener, a neurosurgeon as a witness for the State, testified that he saw Mrs. Wiggins on January 1, 1965 about 12:15 p. m. at DeKalb General Hospital; that X-ray pictures of her head showed an occlusion on the right side of her head which stopped the flow of blood to her brain; that three operations were performed on her prior to her death; and that, in his opinion, one blow on her head would not have caused the injuries to it which his examination revealed. Dr. Henry Snell who was called by the Coroner *611 of DeKalb County to examine the body of Mrs. Wiggins testified that it was his opinion from the appearance, general pattern, location and distribution of the injuries he found on her head and neck that they could not have resulted from a fall or a series of falls; that a fall might have produced one or more of the injuries he found on her body but not those on the bridge of her nose, under her jaw, her left eye, and on top of her head; that there were blunt force injuries over her cheeks, her jaw, her lips, the top, side, and back of her head as well as the right side of her neck; that the several injuries she sustained when viewed together formed a pattern of assault; that they were not in his opinion produced by a fall or series of falls; and that the cause of her death, in his opinion, resulted from blunt force injuries. The father and two brothers of the deceased testified that the defendant voluntarily told them that he did not remember hitting or striking her with anything other than his fists and that he had killed the only person he ever loved. From this evidence the jury was authorized to find that the accused, while drunk, inflicted injuries on his wife which caused her death and there is clearly no merit in the contention that his conviction for murder was unauthorized from the State\\'s failure to show that he intended to kill his wife or that no motive on his part was shown by the State for such killing. The law presumes every homicide to be malicious until the contrary appears from facts or circumstances showing excuse or justification. Weatherby v. State, 213 Ga. 188 (2) (97 SE2d 698).\\nJudgment affirmed.

On March 11, 2024,\\nElaine and Lauren (“Applicants”) filed this application for discretionary appeal\\nseeking review of seven probate court orders appointing temporary substitute\\nguardians and/or conservators, and a separate probate court order approving the\\nsettlement of Lauren’s workers’ compensation claim and establishing a special needs\\ntrust.1 These orders were entered between November 1, 2019, and October 26, 2021.\\n      We lack jurisdiction because the application is untimely.

The instant\\napplication was untimely filed more than two years after entry of the most recent\\nchallenged order.2\\n\\n      1\\n        Appellants filed this application in the Supreme Court, which transferred the\\ncase to this Court. See Case No. S24D0737 (Mar. 27, 2024).\\n      2\\n       On February 11, 2022, at Lauren’s request and the recommendation of her\\ntemporary substitute conservator, the probate court transferred this matter to a\\nprobate court in Missouri, where Lauren resided. In that order, the court also\\ndismissed three notices of appeal to superior court that Applicants had filed in\\n       In their application, Applicants also seek an extension of time to file the\\napplication, but this request is also untimely and must be denied.

RAYNIER MARQUEZ et al. v. RAFAEL E. AGUIRRE.\\n\\n      On May 31, 2023, Raynier Marquez (“Appellant”) filed a notice of appeal from\\nthe trial court’s March 30, 2023 order granting Rafael E. Aguirre’s (“Appellee”)\\nlegitimation petition and terminating Marquez’s parental rights.1 Thereafter, on\\nAugust 31, 2023, Appellee moved in the trial court to dismiss the appeal based on a\\ndelay in the filing of the transcripts. While that motion was pending in the trial court,\\nthe case was transmitted to this Court and docketed as Case No. A24A0340 on\\nSeptember 22, 2023. Appellee moved in this Court to remand the case to allow the\\ntrial court to rule on the motion to dismiss the appeal. Appellant did not oppose\\nremanding the case for this purpose. We remanded the case, and, following a hearing,\\nthe trial court entered an order on March 20, 2024, denying the motion to dismiss.2\\n      Appellant then filed this application for discretionary appeal on April 22, 2024,\\nseeking to appeal the March 30, 2023 legitimation and termination order. However,\\nthe application, filed 33 days after entry of the March 20, 2024 order denying\\nAppellee’s motion to dismiss, is untimely as to that order and any previously entered\\norders. To be timely, an application for discretionary review must be filed within 30\\ndays of entry of the order at issue. OCGA § 5-6-35 (d).

Therefore, the instant application is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.\\n      Nevertheless, because Appellant already filed a timely notice of appeal after we\\ngranted his application for discretionary review of the March 30, 2023 order, and the\\ntrial court denied Appellee’s motion to dismiss the appeal, Appellant may now\\nproceed with his appeal.

THOMPSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        COLVIN, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Diante Thompson appeals his convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and other crimes related to the stabbing death of Bobby\\n\\nJermaine Ricks.1 On appeal, Appellant contends that the evidence\\n\\n\\n        1Bobby Ricks died on October 11, 2017. On September 25, 2018, a\\nHancock County grand jury charged Appellant, Demarco Draughn, Benny\\nHayward, and Xavier Levatte with malice murder (Count 1), felony murder\\n(Count 2), and aggravated assault (Count 3).\\n      On June 20, 2019, Appellant filed a motion to sever Appellant’s trial from\\nhis co-indictees’ trial, which the trial court granted. Appellant’s co-indictees\\nwere convicted of malice murder and other crimes, and their malice murder\\nconvictions were affirmed by this Court in Draughn v. State, \\n311 Ga. 378\\n (\\n858\\nSE2d 8\\n) (2021). Following a jury trial held from October 28 through October\\n30, 2019, the jury found Appellant guilty on all charges. On October 30, 2019,\\nthe trial court sentenced Appellant to life in prison without the possibility of\\nparole for malice murder (Count 1). The felony-murder count (Count 2) was\\nvacated by operation of law. Though the trial court purported to merge Count\\n3 into Count 2, Count 3 actually merged into Count 1, because Count 2 had\\nbeen vacated. See Favors v. State, \\n296 Ga. 842\\n, 848 (5) (\\n770 SE2d 855\\n) (2015).\\n      Appellant timely filed a motion for new trial on November 8, 2019, and\\namended it through new counsel on February 10, 2023. Following a hearing on\\nJuly 12, 2023, the trial court denied Appellant’s amended motion for new trial\\n presented at trial was constitutionally insufficient to sustain his\\n\\nconvictions and that the trial court erred by failing to grant a new\\n\\ntrial on the general grounds, as provided in OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and\\n\\n5-5-21. Appellant also argues that the State committed reversible\\n\\nerror in its closing argument in two ways: by telling the jury that it\\n\\nneeded to adjudicate the guilt of Appellant’s co-indictees, who were\\n\\ntried separately, and by allegedly shifting the burden of proof to\\n\\nAppellant. Lastly, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the same allegedly\\n\\nimproper statements made by the State referenced above. For the\\n\\nreasons stated below, we affirm Appellant’s convictions.\\n\\n     1. The evidence at trial showed the following. Ricks was killed\\n\\nin the H-1 dormitory of Hancock State Prison on the evening of\\n\\nOctober 11, 2017. H-1 can house up to 96 inmates and was full or\\n\\nmostly full at the time of the crimes. Security camera footage of the\\n\\n\\n\\non July 14, 2023.\\n      Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals on\\nAugust 11, 2023, and the case was transferred to this Court on September 1,\\n2023. This appeal was docketed to this Court’s term beginning in December\\n2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                    2\\n common area in H-1 on the evening of October 11 was entered into\\n\\nevidence and played at trial. The video showed the following. The\\n\\nshower area of the H-1 dormitory contained six shower stalls, with\\n\\nthree on the main floor and three on the second floor. At 11:13 p.m.,\\n\\nCorrectional Officer Erica Hood walked across the shower area,\\n\\nopened the door to the TV room, and spoke to various inmates,\\n\\nincluding an inmate who identified himself at trial as Jermel\\n\\nTannahill.\\n\\n     A few minutes later, a group of five inmates gathered in the far\\n\\ncorner of the common area and walked toward the shower stalls on\\n\\nthe main floor. One of these inmates later identified himself to\\n\\ninvestigators and again at trial as Patrick Renfroe. As the inmates\\n\\napproached the showers, Renfroe stopped in front of his cell and\\n\\nstood looking out across the common area. The four remaining\\n\\ninmates continued walking without pause and entered the shower\\n\\nin which Ricks was bathing. There, they started to fight him. Ricks\\n\\nfought his way out of the shower stall and ran away, naked and\\n\\nbleeding, with the four inmates chasing him. Ricks ran toward the\\n\\n                                 3\\n exit, which is enclosed by a metal gate known as the “sally port” and\\n\\nfell to the ground. As Ricks laid on the ground, the four inmates\\n\\nstabbed him repeatedly with sharp metal objects.\\n\\n     Ricks quickly got off the floor, leaving a pool of blood on the\\n\\nground, and ran back toward the showers. The attackers continued\\n\\nto chase Ricks. Ricks then cut back toward the sally port, which\\n\\nOfficer Hood opened, and Ricks entered. The attackers dispersed\\n\\nback toward their cells. Ricks was transported by ambulance to the\\n\\nhospital shortly thereafter but died en route.\\n\\n     At trial, multiple witnesses testified about the identities of the\\n\\nfour inmates who attacked Ricks. Officer Hood testified that she was\\n\\nthe only correctional officer assigned to the floor of H-1 that night\\n\\nand that she was starting to lock the dormitory down for the evening\\n\\nwhen the fight broke out. She testified that she did not know the\\n\\nnames of any of the attackers, but she recognized one as having\\n\\n“dark eyes, jagged teeth, and a receding hairline.” Officer Hood\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  4\\n identified this attacker at trial as Appellant. 2\\n\\n      Tannahill, one of the inmates who spoke to Officer Hood\\n\\nimmediately prior to the attack, testified that he observed the fight\\n\\nfrom the TV room, which had six windows from which he could\\n\\nclearly see into the shower area. He testified that he knew one of the\\n\\nattackers by his tattoos and haircut and that he knew the others by\\n\\ntheir nicknames: “Golds,” “Glock Nine,” and “Jersey.” Tannahill told\\n\\nGBI agents in an interview that the inmate he recognized by his\\n\\ntattoos and haircut was Demarco Draughn; “Golds” was the\\n\\nnickname for inmate Benny Hayward, who had gold teeth; “Glock\\n\\nNine” was the nickname for Xavier Levatte, who had a laundry bag\\n\\nin his cell with “Glock Nine” written on it; and “Jersey” was\\n\\nAppellant’s nickname.\\n\\n      An audio-recorded interview conducted by the Georgia\\n\\nDepartment of Corrections (“GDOC”) of Renfroe, the inmate who\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Cross-examination revealed that Hood was unable to identify any of the\\n\\nattackers on the morning after Ricks was killed and that the first time she ever\\nidentified Appellant was months later, when she first met with the State.\\n\\n                                       5\\n walked with the attackers toward the showers but stopped and stood\\n\\noutside his cell, was admitted into evidence and played for the jury.\\n\\nIn the interview, Renfroe identified each of the attackers, including\\n\\nAppellant. 3\\n\\n     A correctional officer who tracked street gangs in Hancock\\n\\nState Prison testified regarding gang activity in H-1 and the gang-\\n\\naffiliation of the inmates who allegedly stabbed Ricks. He explained\\n\\nthat the Bloods gang is divided into East Coast and West Coast\\n\\nBloods; that there were multiple different sects of East Coast Bloods\\n\\nwithin the prison, including “Sex, Money, Murder,” “G-Shine,” and\\n\\n“Nine Trey”; that there was a sect of West Coast Bloods within the\\n\\nprison known as the “Inglewood Family Gangster Blood”; and that\\n\\n“Sex, Money, Murder” is also referred to as “Rollack.” Ricks,\\n\\nAppellant, Draughn, and Hayward were Sex, Money, Murder or\\n\\nRollack Bloods. Renfroe was an Inglewood Blood, and Levatte was a\\n\\nNine Trey Blood. The officer explained that Bloods live by various\\n\\nrules, including a strict prohibition on homosexuality. The officer\\n\\n\\n     3 At trial, Renfroe stated that he could not remember who stabbed Ricks.\\n\\n                                     6\\n also explained that if a Blood gang member violates one of their\\n\\nrules, a “hit” is placed on him and that person is called a “dub.”\\n\\n     As to the motive behind Ricks’s murder, Renfroe and Tannahill\\n\\nboth pointed to allegations that Ricks engaged in homosexual\\n\\nactivity, which was prohibited by Ricks’s gang. In Renfroe’s\\n\\ninterview with GDOC agents, Renfroe stated that Ricks was\\n\\nconsidered a “dub” by his gang because Ricks was believed to be\\n\\nengaging in homosexual activity and because he had allegedly been\\n\\ncaught engaging in similar activity at his prior prison. The State\\n\\nalso introduced into evidence an e-mail from Tannahill to his\\n\\ngirlfriend in which he reported that Ricks was stabbed for engaging\\n\\nin homosexual activity.\\n\\n     Renfroe also pointed to Ricks’s gang affiliation when\\n\\nexplaining why he believed Ricks was killed. Renfroe explained that,\\n\\ngenerally, if Ricks was going to be punished for breaking the gang’s\\n\\nrules, it would be by members of his own gang. Renfroe told GDOC\\n\\nagents that the attack, therefore, must have been a “Rollack call,”\\n\\nand that there were only four to five members of Sex, Money, Murder\\n\\n                                  7\\n in H-1.\\n\\n     Gregory Johnson, Ricks’s roommate at the time of the attack,\\n\\ntestified that they had only been roommates for three days when\\n\\nRicks was killed. Johnson explained that Ricks paid Johnson’s\\n\\nformer roommate to switch rooms so that Ricks could room with\\n\\nJohnson. Johnson also testified that Ricks and Appellant got into a\\n\\nverbal argument on the same day of the attack.\\n\\n     A crime scene specialist testified that he found a bucket filled\\n\\nwith a foamy solution that smelled like bleach in Renfroe and\\n\\nLavette’s cell, cell 115, and that there were inmate uniform pants\\n\\nsoaking in the solution. He also discovered that the white sink had\\n\\na red tint to it, which he explained was likely caused by someone\\n\\nwashing blood off himself in the sink. 4\\n\\n     A special agent with GDOC testified that two homemade sharp\\n\\nobjects, known as shanks, were found in a “pipe chase” beside cell\\n\\n109 a week after the murder. The agent explained that a pipe chase\\n\\n\\n     4 The crime scene specialist testified that the sink was not tested for\\n\\nblood because the nature of sinks having “multiple things being washed inside\\n[them]” can lead to a false positive.\\n                                     8\\n is an area between two cells where inmates often hide things.\\n\\n     A GBI agent testified that DNA from the handle of one of the\\n\\nshanks found in the pipe chase near Draughn’s cell (cell 109)\\n\\nmatched Draughn’s DNA and that DNA from the blade of that shank\\n\\nmatched Ricks’s DNA. She also testified that a drop of blood was\\n\\nfound on the pants Hayward wore on the night of the attack.5\\n\\n     The medical examiner who conducted Ricks’s autopsy testified\\n\\nthat she found eleven stab wounds on his back, ribs, liver, and right\\n\\nkidney. She listed his cause of death as multiple sharp- force\\n\\ninjuries. When shown pictures of the shanks recovered from the pipe\\n\\nchase, she testified that they could have caused the stab wounds.\\n\\n     2. Appellant argues that the evidence was constitutionally\\n\\ninsufficient to support his convictions and that the trial court erred\\n\\nby denying Appellant’s motion for new trial under OCGA §§ 5-5-20\\n\\nand 5-5-21. Appellant conflates his sufficiency and general grounds\\n\\nclaims in the argument section of his brief; the claims are “two\\n\\ndistinct legal arguments” with “distinct legal standards.” Casey v.\\n\\n\\n     5 The evidence did not indicate whose blood was on Hayward’s pants.\\n\\n                                    9\\n State, \\n310 Ga. 421\\n, 425 (2) (\\n851 SE2d 550\\n) (2020). We accordingly\\n\\naddress each separately and hold that both claims fail.\\n\\n     (a) When evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter\\n\\nof constitutional due process, we view the evidence presented at trial\\n\\nin the light most favorable to the verdicts and consider whether any\\n\\nrational juror could have found the defendant guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt of the crimes of which he was convicted. See\\n\\nJackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n, 319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560)\\n\\n(1979); Ward v. State, \\n316 Ga. 295\\n, 298 (2) (\\n888 SE2d 75\\n) (2023). “In\\n\\nthis review, we do not weigh the evidence on appeal or resolve\\n\\nconflicts in trial testimony.” Ward, 316 Ga. at 298 (2) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdicts, the evidence\\n\\nhere shows that three eyewitnesses identified Appellant as one of\\n\\nthe inmates who attacked Ricks: Officer Hood, Renfroe, and\\n\\nTannahill. Though the quality of the security camera footage is\\n\\ninadequate by itself to confirm these identifications, it is consistent\\n\\nwith the witnesses’ accounts of the attack. Additionally, Ricks’s\\n\\n                                  10\\n roommate, Johnson, testified that Appellant and Ricks, who were\\n\\nboth members of the Sex, Money, Murder sect of the East Coast\\n\\nBloods, had a verbal altercation in the hours before Ricks’s murder.\\n\\nAnd Renfroe’s statements during his recorded interview, together\\n\\nwith Tannahill’s e-mail to his girlfriend, indicated that Ricks was\\n\\nmurdered by members of his own gang, including Appellant, for\\n\\nfailing to follow the gang’s rules prohibiting homosexuality. In\\n\\nRenfroe’s interview, he stated that the “hit” on Ricks was made by\\n\\nSex, Money, Murder Bloods.\\n\\n     This evidence was sufficient to uphold Appellant’s convictions.\\n\\nSee Bates v. State, \\n317 Ga. 809\\n, 814-815 (2) (\\n896 SE2d 581\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(holding that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s\\n\\nconvictions of malice murder, felony murder, armed robbery, and\\n\\nother related offenses where eyewitnesses identified defendant as\\n\\nthe shooter and physical evidence supported their testimony); Ward,\\n\\n316 Ga. at 298-299 (2) (holding that the evidence was sufficient to\\n\\nsupport defendant’s convictions of malice murder and aggravated\\n\\nassault of an inmate where another inmate testified that\\n\\n                                11\\n defendant’s gang put a “hit” on the inmate victim for a debt and\\n\\nidentified defendant as one of the individuals who attacked the\\n\\nvictim by stabbing him with a shank).\\n\\n     (b) Even when the evidence is legally sufficient to uphold a\\n\\nconviction, a trial judge may grant a new trial if the verdict of the\\n\\njury is “contrary to the principles of justice and equity,” OCGA § 5-\\n\\n5-20, or if the verdict is “decidedly and strongly against the weight\\n\\nof the evidence,” OCGA § 5-5-21. See Wilkerson v. State, \\n307 Ga. 574\\n,\\n\\n574-575 (\\n837 SE2d 300\\n) (2019). When a defendant properly raises\\n\\nthese grounds for new trial, commonly known as the “general\\n\\ngrounds,” the trial court exercises broad discretion to sit as the\\n\\n“thirteenth juror” and consider matters typically reserved to the\\n\\njury, including conflicts in the evidence, witness credibility, and the\\n\\nweight of the evidence. King v. State, \\n316 Ga. 611\\n, 616 (2) (\\n889 SE2d\\n\\n851\\n) (2023). “The merits of a trial court’s discretion on the general\\n\\ngrounds are not subject to our review – that decision is vested solely\\n\\nin the trial court.” Lee v. State, __ Ga. __ (\\n897 SE2d 856\\n) (2024)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). Where as here, Appellant argues\\n\\n                                  12\\n that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial based\\n\\non the general grounds, his claim presents us nothing to review. See\\n\\nLee, __ Ga. at __. 6\\n\\n      3. Appellant next contends that the State committed reversible\\n\\nerror by making two allegedly improper statements in closing\\n\\nargument. Appellant failed to preserve either claim for appellate\\n\\nreview, however, so these claims fail.\\n\\n      First, Appellant argues that the State committed reversible\\n\\nerror by telling the jury that it needed to determine the guilt or\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 As noted in Division 2 above, Appellant raised both general grounds\\n\\nand constitutional sufficiency claims, albeit in a single enumeration of error.\\nWe addressed each claim separately because, as noted, they are “two distinct\\nlegal arguments” that “require the trial court to apply distinct legal standards.”\\nCasey, 310 Ga. at 425 (2). At times in the past, we have performed a Jackson\\nsufficiency analysis in evaluating the general grounds. See, e.g., Montgomery\\nv. State, \\n315 Ga. 467\\n, 474 (3) (\\n883 SE2d 351\\n) (2023); Bundel v. State, \\n308 Ga.\\n317\\n, 318-319 (1) (\\n840 SE2d 349\\n) (2020); Lewis v. State, \\n296 Ga. 259\\n, 261 (3)\\n(\\n765 SE2d 911\\n) (2014).\\n       Although many of us continue to “question whether it is proper for this\\nCourt to import Jackson into an appellate review of the general grounds (or to\\notherwise rely on Jackson as part of that analysis),” we need not resolve that\\nissue today because Appellant raised both claims and because, as held in\\nDivision 2 (a), the evidence against Appellant was constitutionally sufficient to\\naffirm his convictions. King v. State, \\n317 Ga. 611\\n, 616 n.8 (2) (\\n889 SE2d 851\\n)\\n(2023). See also Blash v. State, \\n318 Ga. 325\\n, 334 (2) (b) n.6 (__ SE2d __) (2024);\\nPriester v. State, \\n317 Ga. 477\\n, 484 n.13 (3) (\\n893 SE2d 751\\n) (2023); Muse v. State,\\n316 Ga. 639\\n, 653 n.6 (4) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023).\\n                                       13\\n innocence of Appellant and his co-indictees: Lavette, Hayward, and\\n\\nDraughn, whose trial had been severed from Appellant’s. To account\\n\\nfor this procedural history, the trial judge and the parties reached\\n\\nan agreement at the charge conference on the following jury\\n\\ninstruction: “[t]hough you may consider all the evidence as a whole,\\n\\nyou, the jury, must determine the guilt or innocence of [Appellant]\\n\\nonly, and you are not to consider the three co-defendants contained\\n\\nin this indictment.” Notwithstanding the State’s assent to the trial\\n\\ncourt’s agreed-upon instructions, the prosecutor made the following\\n\\nstatement to the jury in closing argument:\\n\\n     You all are here to make the determination about this\\n     indictment. Let me tell you about your decisions, and\\n     that’s all you have to decide. In Count One, whether\\n     Demarco Michael Draughn, Benny Hayward, Xavier\\n     Connell Levatte, and the Defendant before the Court,\\n     [Appellant] committed malice murder in Count One.\\n\\nDefense counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s comment or\\n\\nrequest a curative instruction. Following the parties’ closing\\n\\narguments, the trial court instructed the jury as previously agreed.\\n\\nA copy of the indictment with the co-indictees’ names redacted from\\n\\n\\n                                14\\n it was given to the jury to consider during its deliberations.\\n\\n     Second, Appellant argues that the State committed reversible\\n\\nerror because the prosecutor stated in his closing argument that\\n\\n“there has been no evidence exonerating [Appellant], [and] there has\\n\\nbeen no evidence pointing to somebody else as being the real killer.”\\n\\nDefense counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s comment or\\n\\nrequest a curative instruction.\\n\\n     Because defense counsel failed to object to either of the\\n\\nprosecutor’s allegedly improper statements in closing arguments at\\n\\ntrial, neither claim is preserved for appellate review. See Moon v.\\n\\nState, \\n311 Ga. 421\\n, 426 (4) (\\n858 SE2d 18\\n) (2021) (holding that\\n\\nappellant’s claim was unpreserved for appellate review because\\n\\ndefense counsel did not object to the alleged error made in closing\\n\\nand explaining that “we do not review unpreserved challenges to\\n\\nclosing arguments in non-death penalty cases, even for plain error”).\\n\\n     4. Lastly, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective by failing to object to the two allegedly\\n\\nimproper statements made by the prosecutor described in Division\\n\\n                                  15\\n 3, above. For the reasons that follow, Appellant’s claim lacks merit.\\n\\n     To obtain relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of\\n\\ncounsel, a defendant generally must show both that his counsel’s\\n\\nperformance was constitutionally deficient and that this deficient\\n\\nperformance prejudiced him. See Strickland v. Washington, \\n466 U.S.\\n\\n668\\n, 687 (III) (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984); Monroe v. State,\\n\\n315 Ga. 767\\n, 781 (6) (\\n884 SE2d 906\\n) (2023). “If the defendant fails to\\n\\nsatisfy either prong of the Strickland test, this Court is not required\\n\\nto examine the other.” Monroe, 315 Ga. at 781 (6).\\n\\n     (a) Assuming without deciding that defense counsel was\\n\\ndeficient in failing to object to the prosecutor’s statement regarding\\n\\nthe jury’s duty to assess the guilt of Appellant’s co-indictees,\\n\\nAppellant has failed to show a reasonable probability that the result\\n\\nof his trial would have been different but for the statement. First,\\n\\nany harm caused by the comment was mitigated by the trial court’s\\n\\nissuance of the previously agreed-upon jury instruction and its use\\n\\nof a redacted indictment that did not contain the co-indictees’\\n\\nnames. Second, there was ample evidence of Appellant’s guilt, as\\n\\n                                  16\\n three eyewitnesses identified Appellant as one of the attackers.\\n\\nConsidering the trial court’s instruction to the jury, the redacted\\n\\nindictment, and the strength of the evidence against Appellant, we\\n\\ncannot say that, had defense counsel objected, there is a reasonable\\n\\nprobability that the result of Appellant’s trial would have been\\n\\ndifferent. See Walker v. State, \\n312 Ga. 232\\n, 242 (4) (c) (iv) (\\n862 SE2d\\n\\n285\\n) (2021) (holding that appellant’s ineffective-assistance claim\\n\\nfails because even though the prosecutor’s comment “comes\\n\\nuncomfortably close to – and may well cross over – the boundaries\\n\\nof permissible argument,” appellant failed to show that there was a\\n\\nreasonable probability the result of his trial would have been\\n\\ndifferent “in light of all the evidence presented”); Draughn, 311 Ga.\\n\\nat 383-384 (2) (b) (holding that appellant failed to show that he was\\n\\nprejudiced by defense counsel’s failure to object to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nallegedly improper statement where the alleged error “was cured by\\n\\nthe trial court’s instructions to the jury” and the evidence was\\n\\n“plainly sufficient”).\\n\\n     (b) As to the prosecutor’s comment in closing that “there has\\n\\n                                  17\\n been no evidence exonerating [Appellant], [and] there has been no\\n\\nevidence pointing to somebody else as being the real killer,” defense\\n\\ncounsel was not deficient in failing to object to the State’s comment.\\n\\n“A prosecutor is granted wide latitude in the conduct of closing\\n\\nargument.” Scott v. State, \\n290 Ga. 883\\n, 885 (2) (\\n725 SE2d 305\\n)\\n\\n(2012). “A closing argument is to be judged in the context in which\\n\\nit is made.” Booth v. State, \\n301 Ga. 678\\n, 686 (4) (\\n804 SE2d 104\\n)\\n\\n(2017). Further, “[w]hether to object to a particular part of a\\n\\nprosecutor’s closing argument is a tactical decision, and counsel’s\\n\\ndecision not to make an objection must be patently unreasonable to\\n\\nrise to the level of deficient performance.” Cochran v. State, \\n305 Ga.\\n\\n827\\n, 833 (2) (c) (\\n828 SE2d 338\\n) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     Viewed in context, the prosecutor was simply highlighting that\\n\\nAppellant’s theory of the case—that someone other than Appellant\\n\\nwas the fourth attacker—was illogical based on the evidence. In this\\n\\ncontext, the prosecutor’s comment that “there has been no evidence\\n\\nexonerating [Appellant], [and] there has been no evidence pointing\\n\\n                                 18\\n to somebody else as being the real killer” did not improperly shift\\n\\nthe burden to Appellant to prove his innocence, and the statement\\n\\nwas therefore not improper. See Ridley v. State, \\n315 Ga. 452\\n, 457-\\n\\n458 (4) (a) (\\n883 SE2d 357\\n) (2023) (holding that prosecutor’s\\n\\nstatement in closing that defendant had the same power to subpoena\\n\\nwitnesses as the State did not improperly shift the burden of proof\\n\\nto defendant, but rather was a proper comment on defendant’s\\n\\nfailure to present evidence); Kimbro v. State, \\n317 Ga. 442\\n, 452 (7)\\n\\n(\\n893 SE2d 678\\n) (2023) (holding that there was no error arising from\\n\\nprosecutor’s statement in closing that “there is no defense raised by\\n\\nthis evidence” and explaining that such comments did not amount\\n\\nto improper burden shifting); Johnson v. State, \\n271 Ga. 375\\n, 383 (15)\\n\\n(a) (\\n519 SE2d 221\\n) (1999) (holding that prosecutor’s “make them\\n\\nexplain” argument in closing was not an improper shifting of the\\n\\nburden of proof). Because the statement was not improper, defense\\n\\ncounsel was not deficient for failing to object to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nstatement. See Gatson v. State, \\n307 Ga. 634\\n, 640 (2) (b) (\\n837 SE2d\\n\\n808\\n) (2020) (noting that failure to raise a meritless objection is not\\n\\n                                 19\\n evidence of ineffective assistance).\\n\\n     Because Appellant has failed to show prejudice resulting from\\n\\nthe prosecutor’s failure to object to the prosecutor’s statement\\n\\nregarding the jury’s duty to assess the guilt of Appellant’s co-\\n\\nindictees and because Appellant has failed to show that his trial\\n\\ncounsel was deficient for failing to object to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nallegedly   burden-shifting    comments,   Appellant’s   ineffective-\\n\\nassistance claims fail.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

Electric and gas companies are required to pay a percentage of non-industrial gross revenue from the sale of electricity and gas in the unincorporated area of the county, and telephone companies are required to pay sums based on the number of telephones in service in the unincorporated area. The ordinance also requires a fee of $75 and $.50 per square yard before any company shall make any cut, excavation, or tunnel in, upon, under, or across any sidewalk, roadbed, street, pavement, or right of way in the unincorporated area of the county, in addition to restoring such area to its previous condition. The ordinance provides for fine and imprisonment for any person violating it.\\n1. \"The distinction between a tax and a license is not one of names but of substance. A tax is primarily intended to produce revenue, while a license is primarily intended for regulation under the police power.\" Richmond County *513 Business Assn. v. Richmond County, 224 Ga. 854, 856 (165 SE2d 293). The ordinance enacted by DeKalb County does not even purport to regulate the companies affected by it, and these companies are already regulated by the Georgia Public Service Commission. The ordinance was not a licensing ordinance under the police power of the county, but was a taxing ordinance. Richmond County v. Richmond County Business Assn., 225 Ga. 568 (170 SE2d 246); s.c. 228 Ga. 281 (185 SE2d 399).\\n2. \"Each county shall be a body corporate with such powers and limitations as may be prescribed by law.\" Constitution, Art. XI, Sec. I, Par. I (Code Ann. § 2-7801). Counties can exercise only such powers as are conferred on them by law, and a county can exercise no powers except such as are expressly given or necessarily implied from express grant of other powers. Albany Bottling Co. v. Watson, 103 Ga. 503 (1) (30 SE 270); Town of Decatur v. DeKalb County, 130 Ga. 483 (61 SE 23); Bowers v. Hanks, 152 Ga. 659 (1) (111 SE 38); Barton v. Hardin, 204 Ga. 108 (1) (48 SE2d 882); Beazley v. DeKalb County, 210 Ga. 41 (77 SE2d 740).\\n3. By constitutional amendment (Ga. L. 1958, pp. 582-585) the General Assembly was authorized to empower the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of DeKalb County to levy license taxes on businesses in the unincorporated area of the county, except businesses subject to regulation by the State Public Service Commission. This amendment was implemented by Ga. L. 1959, pp. 2658-2661. DeKalb County contends that the exception in the constitutional amendment violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Code § 1-815). It is unnecessary to rule on this contention since DeKalb County would be in no better position if the constitutional amendment were held void, for the exception as to businesses regulated by the Public Service Commission is an integral part of the constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to empower DeKalb *514 County to assess license taxes, and the exception could not be held void without declaring the whole amendment void. \"If a statute is in part valid and in part invalid, and the objectionable portion is so connected with the general scheme of the statute that it cannot be stricken out and effect given to the legislative intent, the whole statute must fall.\" Wright v. Southern Bell Tel. &c. Co., 127 Ga. 227 (2) (56 SE 116); Gay v. Laurens County, 213 Ga. 518 (3) (100 SE2d 271).\\n4. The Act of 1963 (Ga. L. 1963, pp. 3324-3327) strikes the provision of the 1959 Act (Ga. L. 1959, pp. 2658-2661) excepting businesses regulated by the Public Service Commission from the assessment of license fees or taxes. This amendment of the 1959 Act violates the Constitution, Art. III, Sec. VII, Par. XV (Code Ann. § 2-1915), as the notice of intention to apply for local legislation attached to the 1963 Act states specifically the particular ways in which it amends the Acts pertaining to the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues, but omits any reference to the deletion of the provision excepting businesses regulated by the Public Service Commission. Where the notice of intention to apply for local legislation specifically details the matters to be included in the Act, but omits a material provision of the proposed Act, the notice does not meet the requirements of the Constitution (Code Ann. § 2-1915). See Brown v. Clower, 225 Ga. 165 (166 SE2d 363), and cases cited.\\n5. The County of DeKalb has no constitutional or statutory authority to impose the taxes and charges contained in the ordinance under attack in these cases, either as a tax or as a \"rental\" of its streets and rights of way, and the trial court did not err in holding the ordinance void, and granting interlocutory injunction against its enforcement.\\nJudgment affirmed.

McGarity, for appellant.\\nE. Byron Smith, District Attorney, Michael J. Bowers, Attorney General, J. Michael Davis, for appellee.\\nSMITH, Justice.\\nNorman Darnell Baxter was convicted in Henry County for the murder of Katherine June Moore. He was sentenced to death. This case is here on direct appeal for review under the Unified Appeal Procedure (252 Ga. A-13 et seq.) and for sentence review required by OCGA § 17-10-35.[1] We affirm.\\n*539 Around 11:00 p. m. on Saturday, July 5, 1980, June Moore left her parent\\'s house in McDonough to return to her room at the Safari Inn in Henry County. Her family became concerned when she did not appear at the Safari Inn pool the next day to meet them as planned. When they could not locate her on July 7, they filed a missing persons report with the police.\\nOn July 13, tourists found her nude, partially decomposed body in a wooded area to the west of the Safari Inn. Her hands and feet were bound, and a ligature was tied around her throat. She had been strangled.\\nHunters found her car deep in the woods near the Safari Inn on October 14, 1980. The car had been partially stripped. Ms. Moore\\'s parents determined that her diamond ring, her .22 caliber pistol, her hot curler case, and a red dress were missing from her car and her room.\\nAppellant and his ex-wife, Kathy Walker, spent the Fourth of July weekend of 1980 at the Safari Inn. She testified that they returned to their room from an evening out sometime between midnight and 3:00 a. m. on Sunday, July 6. She recalled that appellant left the room shortly after their return, stating that he saw a \"money making thing\" in the parking lot.\\nAccording to her further testimony, appellant returned to the room just after dawn. He smelled terrible and was extremely dirty and sweaty. He brought with him a red dress, a solitaire diamond ring, a hot curler case, a scarf, a small pistol, and some bullets for the pistol. He claimed that he had stolen the objects from the trunk of a car in the parking lot.\\nShe and appellant immediately left the Safari Inn and spent the next few days at motels along I-75 south of Atlanta. Appellant\\'s abusive behavior finally drove her to flee as he paid the bill at an Omelette Shoppe. On her way to refuge at her grandmother\\'s house in Newton County, she threw the pistol, the scarf, and the dress in a dumpster near Porterdale. Appellant, shortly thereafter, sold a ring to the Money Tree Pawn Shop.[2]\\nIn late July or August of 1980, appellant took two of his acquaintances and one of his brothers to see a Ford Futura that matched the description of the victim\\'s car. They testified that appellant had hidden the car deep in the woods near the Safari Inn. At *540 trial, they described with particularity certain items that police had found in the car.\\nTwo of appellant\\'s fellow inmates in the Chatham County Jail testified that appellant had told them that he had choked a woman to death in Atlanta or \"North Georgia.\" A fellow inmate in the Henry County Jail testified that appellant claimed to have strangled a girl at the Safari Inn during a drug deal. According to this inmate, appellant reported that he sold the victim\\'s drugs and bought his wife a white Cadillac with the proceeds.\\n1. In his first, second, and thirty-first enumerations of error, appellant raises the general grounds. We find the evidence sufficient to support the jury\\'s verdict. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).\\n2. In his third, fourth, and fifth enumerations, appellant charges that the trial court erred in refusing to grant him funds to hire investigators and expert witnesses. \"[T]he general rule is that the grant or denial of a motion for assistance of expert witnesses and other investigative services lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\" Castell v. State, 250 Ga. 776, 783 (301 SE2d 234) (1983).\\n(a) The trial court appointed two attorneys to represent appellant in this case in January 1983. The case came to trial in September, 1983. \"Appellant had the assistance of two attorneys for [more than] five months prior to his trial. The court did not abuse its discretion by failing to provide additional funds for an investigator.\" Wilson v. State, 250 Ga. 630, 634 (300 SE2d 640) (1983). We find no error here.\\n(b) The trial court denied appellant\\'s request for funds to hire demographic experts and psychologists to assist him in his challenge to the grand jury selection and jury qualification, and medical experts to assist him in analyzing the physical evidence. While the appropriation of such funds may be authorized under OCGA § 17-12-5, in light of the testimony actually produced as to the grand jury and jury qualification questions, and the nature of the expert testimony produced by the state regarding the time of the victim\\'s death, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of appellant\\'s motion for funds to hire experts. Patterson v. State, 239 Ga. 409, 412 (238 SE2d 2) (1977).\\n3. In his sixth, eleventh, eighteenth, twenty-third, and thirty-fifth enumerations of error, appellant claims that the trial court and the state refused to give him exculpatory or favorable information upon request in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (83 SC 1194, 10 LE2d 215) (1963).\\n(a) Appellant initially claims that the trial court erred in refusing to force the state to provide him with updated rap sheets for its witnesses. At a hearing on this motion, the district attorney stated, \"That is all the rap sheets that I have in my file ... However, I made *541 the statement if Mr. McGarity will contact me on individual cases, I will not look them up for him because I do not have time, but I will make the GCIC computer available to him. I will make arrangements with the police department.\" We find no error. Keller v. State, 253 Ga. 512, 513 (322 SE2d 243) (1984).[3]\\n(b) Appellant next contends that the trial court\\'s refusal to provide him with summaries of Kathy Walker\\'s pre-trial statements violated Brady, supra, as they differed substantially from her testimony at trial. Appellant asserts specifically that before trial she made no mention of appellant\\'s referral to a \"money making thing\" in the parking lot of the Safari Inn on the night of the murder. Appellant claims that this new statement provided the jury with grounds for finding an aggravating circumstance, and was particularly harmful in light of Walker\\'s refusal to talk with his attorneys.\\nIn her pre-trial statements, Kathy Walker stated that appellant had simply told her that he was leaving the room for awhile. The testimony regarding appellant\\'s referral to a \"money making thing\" appears to be an addition to her pre-trial statements. This addition does not, however, create an inconsistency in her testimony. Throughout her involvement with the investigation, Walker maintained that appellant claimed to have stolen the goods in question from the trunk of a car. As the trial court found, this is consistent with the testimony as to the \"money making thing.\"[4] We find no inconsistency and no error. Roberts v. State, 243 Ga. 604, 605 (255 SE2d 689) (1979).\\n4. The state refused to respond to appellant\\'s request for Walker\\'s address. The district attorney advised her that appellant\\'s attorneys wished to speak with her, but that she did not have to speak with them if she did not wish to do so. In his seventh and twelfth enumerations, appellant claims that the state, in effect, discouraged Walker from talking with appellant\\'s attorneys, thereby severely hampering appellant\\'s investigation of the case.\\nWhile the state, in most instances, should provide a defendant with the telephone numbers and addresses of its witnesses, this was not required. Roberts, supra at 606.[5] Here, there was ample evidence of appellant\\'s violent behavior towards the witness to justify the state\\'s decision to withhold the information from appellant. In addition, Walker was not required to speak with appellant\\'s attorneys if she did not so desire. Dover v. State, 250 Ga. 209 (296 SE2d 710) *542 (1982). The district attorney merely informed her of that right.[6] We find no error.\\n5. Appellant, in enumerations eight and nine, asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to provide him with a daily transcript of the day\\'s testimony, and in refusing to allow him to submit a jury questionnaire to prospective jurors prior to voir dire.\\n(a) We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\\'s refusal to provide appellant with a daily transcript. Nunnally v. State, 235 Ga. 693, 699 (221 SE2d 547) (1975).\\n(b) The control of voir dire lies within the discretion of the trial court. Waters v. State, 248 Ga. 355, 363 (283 SE2d 238) (1981). We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\\'s refusal to allow the submission of the jury questionnaire prior to trial.\\n6. Appellant claims, in his tenth enumeration, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.\\nOn March 25, 1983, a detective for the Henry County Police and a Henry County Assistant District Attorney interviewed appellant at the Chatham County Jail, where he was being held on charges unrelated to the Moore murder. Appellant had requested the interview with the hope that his help in the Moore case would cause the Chatham County authorities to be lenient with him. At the interview, he described Moore\\'s car as it had been found, and he claimed to know more about the crime. Appellant\\'s Savannah attorney was aware of the interview and had planned to attend, but he did not appear at the interview.\\nIn early October, the assistant district attorney requested a follow-up interview with appellant. He interviewed appellant in the presence of his Savannah attorney on October 7, 1983. At the interview, appellant named an acquaintance as the murderer of Ms. Moore, and he provided detailed information about the crime. Appellant asserts that the trial court should have suppressed, as fruit of the poisonous tree, all evidence that the state acquired as a result of these two interviews, since no one read appellant his Miranda rights.\\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (86 SC 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966), simply does not apply to a situation such as the first interview. \"By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\" Miranda, supra at 444. Appellant initiated the first interview himself.[7] Appellant volunteered information to the Henry County authorities in an uninduced attempt to gain favorable treatment from the *543 Chatham County authorities. \"There is no requirement that police stop ... a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\" Miranda, supra at 478.\\nThe second interview presents a different situation as appellant\\'s counsel attended the session, and as the state initiated the interview. The Miranda court stated, \"The presence of counsel ... would [have been, here,] the adequate protective device necessary to make the process of police interrogation conform to the dictates of the privilege [against self-incrimination].\" Miranda, supra at 466. We likewise hold, assuming even that the second interview amounted to a custodial interrogation, that the presence of appellant\\'s attorney provided an \"adequate protective device\" in this case. See United States v. Jackson, 390 F2d 317 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 392 U.S. 935 (1968); Dempsey v. State, 225 Ga. 208 (166 SE2d 884) (1969).\\nAs the state did not violate appellant\\'s right against self-incrimination in either interview, the trial court correctly denied appellant\\'s motion to suppress.\\n7. Appellant, in his thirteenth enumeration, charges that the court erred in refusing to allow his counsel to ask six specific questions during voir dire.\\nAppellant\\'s attorney sought to ask: a) \"Do you have an understanding what the term presumption of innocence means to you?\" and; b) \"What does the term reasonable doubt mean to you?\" \"Both questions were of a technical legal nature as they were subjects of the instruction by the court at the conclusion of the trial. They therefore were not a proper area for voir dire examination.\" Wallace v. State, 248 Ga. 255, 259 (282 SE2d 325) (1981); see also Stack v. State, 234 Ga. 19, 26 (214 SE2d 514) (1975).\\nAppellant\\'s counsel also desired to ask prospective jurors whether they \"[felt] that Mr. Baxter, the man on trial, ... must have done something wrong or he would not [have been there]?\" Questions amounting to a prejudgment of the case are improper in a voir dire examination. Pinion v. State, 225 Ga. 36, 37 (165 SE2d 708) (1969). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this question.\\nAppellant\\'s counsel sought the prospective jurors\\' views on abortion. This question would not show \"any interest of the jurors in the case, or any leaning or bias which the jurors might have respecting the crime for which the defendant was on trial.\" Curtis v. State, 224 Ga. 870, 871 (165 SE2d 150) (1968). The question was thus subject to exclusion.\\nAppellant\\'s attorney finally, in two questions, attempted to discern the prospective jurors\\' prospective responses to the possibility that appellant might not testify at trial. Under Pinion, supra, these *544 questions were properly excluded as they sought a prejudgment of the case. We find no error in the voir dire.\\n8. In his fourteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-sixth enumerations, appellant challenges the admissibility of certain evidence admitted by the trial court.\\n(a) Appellant first cites the admission of four photographs of the victim as error. While appellant acknowledges that none of the photographs were taken after an autopsy had been performed, he asserts that the alteration in the body\\'s state, caused by exposure to the elements and evident in the photographs, brings the photographs within the ambit of Brown v. State, 250 Ga. 862 (302 SE2d 347) (1983). Photographs of the victim\\'s body are generally admissible. Hill v. State, 254 Ga. 213 (326 SE2d 757) (1985). Brown, supra, applies to alterations caused by an autopsist, not the combined forces of the murderer and the elements. Appellant\\'s argument is novel but unpersuasive.\\n(b) Appellant next asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce the ligatures found around the victim\\'s throat into evidence. This was not error. Ruffin v. State, 243 Ga. 95, 98 (252 SE2d 472) (1979).\\n(c) Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence photographs of the dumpster where Kathy Walker allegedly disposed of the pistol and of the landfill where the dumpster would have been emptied. As appellant has not shown any harm caused by the admission of these photographs, we find that \"in all likelihood, [they] did not contribute to appellant\\'s conviction.\" Mitchell v. State, 254 Ga. 353 (329 SE2d 481) (1985). We thus find error here, if committed, harmless.\\n9. Appellant claims, in his fifteenth enumeration, that the trial court erred in requiring production of his list of witnesses after voir dire examination. \"[T]he witness list was ordered after both sides invoked the rule of sequestration. It was within the court\\'s discretion to order production of a list of defense witnesses in order to enforce the rule of sequestration.\" Fugitt v. State, 254 Ga. 521, 522 (4) (330 SE2d 714) (1985). We find no error.\\n10. Appellant, in his sixteenth, twenty-fourth, thirty-second, and thirty-third enumerations, asserts that the trial court erred in sustaining certain objections made by the state at trial.\\n(a) First, appellant claims that he should have been allowed to ask the victim\\'s father why he had requested her to stop seeing Don Bussey, her old boyfriend who initially was a suspect in the case. After appellant\\'s counsel rephrased the question, the victim\\'s father stated the purpose of his attempt to prevent Bussey from seeing the victim. We find no error.\\n(b) Appellant next contends that he should have been allowed to question Kathy Walker as to the origin of the funds with which she *545 purchased a Cadillac. At the time appellant\\'s counsel posed this question, the subject matter was irrelevant. The trial court did not err in sustaining the state\\'s objection.\\n(c) Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to consider the testimony of Sergeant Dunlap of the Henry County Sheriff\\'s Department at a hearing on a motion to suppress. Appellant claimed that Dunlap\\'s testimony would impeach the testimony of one of the inmates who testified against appellant. Appellant specifically claimed that Dunlap would show that appellant and the inmate could not have spoken at the time that the inmate claimed appellant confessed. Appellant states, \"If Dunlap was believed, [the inmate] McWilliams\\' testimony could not be truthful,\" thus, Dunlap\\'s testimony should have been considered.\\nAppellant\\'s motion to suppress was based upon the theory that the inmate was an agent of the state.[8] While the specific segments of testimony cited by appellant may raise some doubts as to the inmate\\'s credibility, the testimony as a whole was ambiguous as to the issue involved in the motion to suppress, and the trial court did not err in refusing to consider the testimony.\\n(d) Appellant finally contends that the trial court erred in refusing to allow a police officer to testify as to the nature of a complaint registered about the victim by Bussey\\'s new girl friend. We agree with the state that appellant did place evidence of difficulties between the new girl friend and the victim before the jury. We find no error in the exclusion of the testimony as to the source of the difficulties.\\n11. Appellant asserts, in his seventeenth enumeration, that the trial court erred in refusing to strike the testimony of the victim\\'s sister.\\nDuring her first interview with the Henry County Police, the victim\\'s sister identified appellant when she was shown his photograph. She subsequently picked appellant\\'s picture out of a group of photographs. She later identified appellant at trial. She then testified that she and the victim had seen appellant at the Safari Inn pool on July 4, 1980. She claimed to have seen appellant winking at the victim and flirting with her.\\nAppellant claims that the initial showing of the single photograph was overly suggestive and therefore tainted the courtroom identification. Here, as in Burrell v. State, 239 Ga. 792 (239 SE2d 11) (1977), the witness established a basis for her courtroom identification independent of the single photograph. We find no error.\\n12. Appellant, in his nineteenth and twentieth enumerations, contends that two of the inmates who testified against him were *546 agents for the state and should not have been allowed to testify under United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264 (100 SC 2183, 65 LE2d 115) (1979).\\nIn Henry, supra, the United States Supreme Court required the suppression of an incriminatory statement made by a defendant to a fellow inmate. The fellow inmate was a paid informant placed in jail with the defendant under a contingent fee arrangement. The court relied upon the facts that: 1) The informant was paid by, and was acting under the instructions of government; 2) He was \"ostensibly no more than a fellow inmate of [the defendant],\" and; 3) The defendant was \"in custody and under indictment at the time that he was engaged in conversation with [the informant.]\" Henry, supra at 270.\\nThe facts established pursuant to appellant\\'s motion to suppress the two statements show that neither inmate acted as a paid informant subject to the state\\'s direction. Both inmates testified that they acted out of hope for lenient treatment at the hands of the state. Both also testified that they received no promises of help in return for any evidence that they might produce.\\nThe trial court was entitled to find from the evidence presented that the inmates, not the state, initiated contact with appellant. An inmate who acts upon the expectation of an unpromised reward does not thereby become an agent for the state. We therefore find Henry, supra, inapplicable and the testimony admissible. See Harper v. State, 249 Ga. 519, 528 (292 SE2d 389) (1982).\\n13. Appellant, in his twenty-first enumeration, claims that the trial court\\'s charge on impeachment by production of prior inconsistent statements coupled with its refusal to compel the state to produce Kathy Walker\\'s pre-trial statements constituted error. As we have decided that Walker\\'s pre-trial statements are not inconsistent with her testimony at trial, we find no error.\\n14. Appellant, in his twenty-second enumeration, contends that the trial court erred in giving the following charge:\\n\"I charge you that if you find that the crime in the indictment as charged has been committed and certain property was stolen, and if recently thereafter the defendant was found in possession of such stolen property or any part thereof, that would be a circumstance along with the other evidence in the case from which the jury may infer the guilt of the defendant of the theft and of the charge made on this indictment if you find that there is a connection and if you should see fit to do so, unless of course, the defendant has made an explanation of his possession, if any, consistent with his plea of not guilty.\"\\nAppellant does not contend that this charge creates an impermissible presumption such as the one found in Francis v. Franklin, 37 Conn. L. Rptr. 3019 (Decided April 29, 1985). He asserts, rather, that the trial court \"went too far by stating to the jury that they could infer the *547 guilt of the Appellant of ... murder,\" from recent possession of stolen goods. We disagree.\\nImmediately before the challenged portion of the jury charge the trial court charged the jury that presence at the crime scene, alone, would not sustain a guilty verdict, and that suspicious circumstances would not be sufficient either. The challenged portion of the charge simply presented another possible approach to the circumstantial evidence developed in the case. Williamson v. State, 248 Ga. 47, 54 (281 SE2d 512) (1981). We find the challenged instruction balanced, as a whole, and we thus find no error.\\n15. Appellant, in his twenty-eighth enumeration of error, contests the propriety of the admission into evidence of a pawn ticket bearing his name.\\nThe pawn ticket clearly constitutes a record of a transaction. The owner of the pawn shop testified that he normally kept records, such as the one in question, as a normal practice, on \"every transaction, pawn or purchase.\" He also testified from observation of the ticket in question that it was an original ticket from his shop filled out \"at the time of purchase,\" and sent that day to the police department. Lt. Harrison of the Clayton County Police Department testified that he was custodian of the pawn ticket in question after it was delivered from the pawn shop on the day that it was filled out.\\nThe ticket constituted a contemporaneous record of a transaction made in the regular course of business pursuant to regular business practices, and thus was admissible as evidence of the transaction under OCGA § 24-3-14.\\n16. Appellant, in his twenty-ninth and thirtieth enumerations, claims that the trial court twice allowed into evidence testimony as to his bad character bearing no independent relevance to the issues at trial.\\nGene Couch testified that appellant took him to see the victim\\'s car when it was hidden in the woods near the Safari Inn. Couch stated that when he asked appellant where the car had come from, appellant responded that he had stolen it in Savannah. James Green testified that appellant had been talking to a reporter immediately prior to his \"jailhouse confession\" to Green. He stated at trial that appellant, in talking to the reporter, \"wanted to give them [the media] information on [Moore\\'s] murder so that, you know, he could get some leverage for the case he had there at the time.\"\\n\"If evidence is relevant and material to an issue in [a] case, it is not inadmissible because it incidentally puts the defendant\\'s character in issue. [Cits.]\" Davis v. State, 249 Ga. 309, 310 (290 SE2d 273) (1982). Green\\'s statement placed appellant\\'s character in issue as his testimony showed that appellant was in jail on a charge that was unrelated to the Moore case. We find no error, however, because the *548 testimony was independently relevant as it explained the circumstances leading to the \"jailhouse confession.\"\\nCouch\\'s testimony as to appellant\\'s alleged confession to stealing the victim\\'s car from Savannah placed appellant\\'s character in evidence. The confession, however, was clearly relevant to the issue of whether appellant stole the victim\\'s car. The fact that he claimed to have stolen the victim\\'s car from Savannah does not render this testimony inadmissible. Davis, supra.\\n17. Appellant, in his thirty-fourth enumeration, contends that the trial court erred in refusing to give one of his requested charges. As the trial court\\'s charge presented the substance of the requested charge to the jury, and in fact almost mirrored appellant\\'s requested charge, we find no error. Boyd v. State, 253 Ga. 515, 516 (322 SE2d 256) (1984).\\n18. In his twenty-seventh enumeration, appellant claims that the trial court erred in refusing to force the state to grant him access to notes used by a witness for the state to refresh his memory. We hold that a defendant in a criminal case has the right, upon request, to examine a document used by a witness to refresh his recollection. See Hardin v. State, 252 Ga. 99 (311 SE2d 462) (1984); see also Williams v. State, 250 Ga. 664 (300 SE2d 685) (1983), Weltner, J., concurring specially, and Hill, C. J., dissenting. We overrule any cases holding to the contrary. We find, however, that \"in all likelihood, [the denial of access to the notes] did not contribute to appellant\\'s conviction.\" Mitchell, supra at 355. We thus find the denial to be harmless error.\\nSentence Review\\n19. Appellant contests two aspects of the trial court\\'s charge given during the sentencing phase.\\n(a) Appellant, in his thirty-eighth enumeration, asserts that the court\\'s charge on mitigation was insufficient. \"[T]he jury [was] allowed and instructed ... that it [had] the discretion, notwithstanding proof of aggravating circumstances, to sentence the defendant to life in prison for any reason satisfactory to the jury or without any reason.\" Smith v. Francis, 253 Ga. 782, 786 (325 SE2d 362) (1985). We find the trial court\\'s instructions as to mitigating circumstances sufficient.\\n(b) In his thirty-seventh enumeration, appellant claims that the trial court erred in delivering the following charge to the jury: \"[In connection with (b) (7)], you would determine whether or not the offense of murder was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible, and inhuman, in that it involved torture to the victim and depravity of mind on the part of the defendant in that the death of the victim, Katherine June Moore, was caused by strangulation.\"\\n*549 This instruction clearly informed the jury that a finding of strangulation alone would authorize a finding of aggravation under (b) (7). A finding of strangulation alone does not, as a matter of law, establish torture of the victim or depravity of mind on the part of the defendant. Cf. Phillips v. State, 250 Ga. 336, 339-342 (297 SE2d 217) (1982). Although the totality of the evidence in this case could authorize a finding of aggravation under (b) (7), as we hold in Division 20, infra, we find the challenged instruction to be unclear and potentially misleading. We will thus disregard the jury\\'s finding of aggravation under (b) (7).\\n20. The jury found two aggravating circumstances: \"(1) The defendant committed the offense of murder, for the purpose of receiving things of monetary value [OCGA § 17-10-30 (b) (4)]; (2) The offense of murder was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman in that it involved torture to the victim and depravity of mind on the part of the defendant [OCGA § 17-10-30 (b) (7)].\" Appellant charges, in his thirty-fifth enumeration, that the evidence developed in the case does not support either of the jury\\'s findings of aggravation.\\n(a) The state produced evidence that appellant sold the victim\\'s ring, stripped her car and attempted to sell various parts of the car, and took her pistol after murdering her. Kathy Walker, in addition, testified that appellant left their motel room on the night of the murder in search of a \"money making thing.\" This evidence is sufficient to support a finding of the (b) (4) aggravating circumstance. See Pulliam v. State, 236 Ga. 460, 466-467 (224 SE2d 8) (1976); Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga. 410, 424 (216 SE2d 258) (1975).\\n(b) The state produced evidence that appellant strangled the victim with a ligature, removed her clothes, bound her hands and feet, and dumped her body in a secluded area. The state also provided evidence from which the jury could infer that the victim\\'s hands and feet were bound and her clothes removed before she was murdered. The jury could conclude from this evidence that: 1) The murder was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman, and that; 2) The murder involved torture to the victim or depravity of mind of the defendant.[9] See Hance v. State 245 Ga. 856, 860 (268 SE2d 339) (1980). We find the evidence sufficient to support the jury\\'s finding of the (b) (7) aggravating circumstance.\\n(c) In addition, we find that the death sentence imposed here is neither excessive nor disproportionate to penalties imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. OCGA § 17-10-35 *550 (c). See Appendix.\\n(d) We find that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. OCGA § 17-10-35 (c) (2). As the evidence supported a finding of (b) (4) and (b) (7) aggravating circumstances, and in light of our review of the record, we conclude that the unclear charge on (b) (7) aggravating circumstances did not lead to the imposition of the death sentence under the influence of the above mentioned factors.\\n21. We have reviewed the prosecutor\\'s closing argument at the sentencing phase of the trial, and we find no error. Walker v. State, 254 Ga. 149, 158 (327 SE2d 475) (1985).[10]\\nJudgment affirmed.

SMITH v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PINSON, Justice.\\n\\n       Truman Harry Smith shot and killed Johnny Crawford while\\n\\nthe two were hanging out with friends. At trial, Smith claimed he\\n\\nkilled Crawford in self-defense. But the jury rejected that defense\\n\\nand convicted Smith of felony murder and other charges. On appeal,\\n\\nSmith contends that the trial court should have allowed him to tes-\\n\\ntify that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (rather\\n\\nthan allowing him only to describe his symptoms), and that the trial\\n\\ncourt should not have allowed the State to impeach him with his\\n\\nprior charge for impersonating another under Article 134 of the Uni-\\n\\nform Code of Military Justice. But the rule of evidence that Smith\\n\\nclaims should have allowed him to testify that he had post-traumatic\\n\\nstress disorder—a hearsay exception for statements for the purpose\\n of medical diagnosis—does not apply to medical diagnoses them-\\n\\nselves, and any error in allowing the State to ask about Smith’s mil-\\n\\nitary charge was harmless. So we affirm Smith’s convictions and\\n\\nsentence.\\n\\n      1. Smith was convicted of felony murder and other crimes in\\n\\nconnection with the shooting death of Crawford.1 The evidence at\\n\\ntrial showed the following. 2\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 The shooting happened on September 15, 2016. On August 16, 2021, a\\n\\nDekalb County grand jury indicted Smith for malice murder, felony murder\\npredicated on aggravated assault, aggravated assault, and possession of a fire-\\narm during the commission of a felony. Smith was tried by a jury from August\\n16 to 20, 2021. The jury did not reach a verdict on the malice murder count,\\nbut it found Smith guilty of the remaining counts. Smith was sentenced to life\\nin prison for felony murder and a consecutive five-year prison term for posses-\\nsion of a firearm during the commission of a felony, for a total sentence of life\\nplus five years. The aggravated assault count merged into the felony murder\\ncount for sentencing, and the trial court dead-docketed the malice murder\\ncount. Through new counsel, Smith filed a timely motion for new trial, which\\nhe amended twice. On July 17, 2023, the trial court denied the motion for new\\ntrial, as amended. Because the dead-docketed malice murder count rendered\\nthe judgment non-final, see Seals v. State, \\n311 Ga. 739\\n (\\n860 SE2d 419\\n) (2021),\\nthe trial court also granted a certificate of immediate review, and we subse-\\nquently granted Smith’s application for interlocutory appeal. Smith filed a\\ntimely notice of appeal. The case was docketed to the term of court beginning\\nin December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n       2 In light of the harmless-error analysis we undertake in Division 3 of\\n\\nthis opinion, “we review the record de novo, and we weigh the evidence as we\\nwould expect reasonable jurors to have done so as opposed to viewing it all in\\nthe light most favorable to the jury’s verdict.” See Moore v. State, \\n315 Ga. 263\\n,\\n264 (1) n.2 (\\n882 SE2d 227\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n                                       2\\n      On the night of the shooting, Smith, Crawford, and two other\\n\\nmen, Dulles Smith (Smith’s cousin) and Randy Castillo, met up at\\n\\nCastillo’s home. Dulles and Castillo had known each other for years,\\n\\nand both of them also knew Smith and Crawford, but the evidence\\n\\nconflicted as to whether Smith and Crawford met for the first time\\n\\nthat night (as Smith said) or had known each other before (as Dulles\\n\\nand Castillo said). At Castillo’s house, the four of them sat in the\\n\\nback of Crawford’s truck drinking beer and tequila and smoking ma-\\n\\nrijuana. At first the group was relaxed, laughing and joking. But at\\n\\nsome point Smith pulled out a handgun and pointed it at Crawford.\\n\\nCastillo and Dulles asked Smith what he was doing. Smith replied,\\n\\n“Man, my fault. I’m tripping, man,” and said he was going to put\\n\\naway the gun. Smith went over to Dulles’s car, then returned to the\\n\\nback of the truck, where he resumed talking with the group.\\n\\n     Some time after that, Smith pulled out his gun again and shot\\n\\nCrawford in the face. The evidence conflicted as to whether this hap-\\n\\npened right when Smith rejoined the group (as Smith said), or some-\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 3\\n what later after he temporarily reconciled with—and even em-\\n\\nbraced—Crawford (as Dulles and Castillo said). Dulles saw the\\n\\nshooting. Castillo, who had just gotten up to go inside, did not see it,\\n\\nbut when he looked back he saw Crawford “falling” into the tailgate\\n\\nof his truck and knew Smith was the shooter because he was the\\n\\nonly one with a gun when the shot was fired. Neither Dulles nor\\n\\nCastillo recalled any argument between Smith and Crawford before\\n\\nthe shooting.\\n\\n     Dulles immediately drove Smith back to Dulles’s house, where\\n\\nSmith got in his own car and left. Dulles then returned to the scene\\n\\nof the shooting. Castillo, meanwhile, had rushed inside and called\\n\\n911. When investigators arrived, Dulles told them that Smith was\\n\\nthe shooter. Five days later, Smith was pulled over for speeding in\\n\\nMissouri. The Missouri officer ran Smith’s driver’s license, learned\\n\\nthat a warrant for his arrest had been issued in Georgia, and placed\\n\\nhim under arrest.\\n\\n     Smith testified in his own defense. He admitted he shot Craw-\\n\\nford, but he said he did so because he feared for his life. Smith said\\n\\n                                   4\\n the first time he pulled out his gun was in response to Crawford’s\\n\\nthreat to rob him like he had robbed “other country mother****ers.”\\n\\nSmith showed Crawford his gun at that point as part of a “de-esca-\\n\\nlation” technique he had learned in the military: “shout, show,\\n\\nshove, shoot.” The situation de-escalated, and Smith put away the\\n\\ngun and walked away to calm down. But after Smith came back to\\n\\nthe group, Crawford said, “[Y]ou’re not the only mother****er with\\n\\na gun,” and reached behind him. Smith knew Crawford had a gun\\n\\nand that he was a “Blood gangbanger.” He shot Crawford to “elimi-\\n\\nnate[ ] the threat.” Smith then fled the scene because he feared\\n\\n“more Bloods were coming out.” Later, he left the state to see a friend\\n\\nin Las Vegas. When he was arrested in Missouri, he was on his way\\n\\nback to Georgia to “take care of business.”\\n\\n     2. Smith contends that the trial court erred by not allowing him\\n\\nto tell the jury that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder\\n\\n(PTSD) and instead allowing him only to describe his symptoms.\\n\\nSmith had indicated before trial and in his opening argument that\\n\\nhis defense would rely at least in part on the effects of PTSD on his\\n\\n                                  5\\n mental state, but because he did not introduce a medical expert or\\n\\nother evidence to establish the diagnosis, the State objected to Smith\\n\\ntestifying about PTSD. The State argued that Smith was not a med-\\n\\nical expert and could not testify about a medical condition. But\\n\\nSmith’s counsel argued that Smith had been diagnosed with PTSD\\n\\nby two physicians, “and so he should be allowed to testify that he\\n\\nhas PTSD based on that diagnosis.” The trial court agreed with the\\n\\nState and ruled that Smith, as a lay witness, could not testify about\\n\\na “clinical medical diagnosis,” but that he could describe his symp-\\n\\ntoms. Smith then testified that he had served in combat in Iraq,\\n\\nwhere, among other things, he was trained to “identify the threat\\n\\nand eliminate the threat.” Since his return home, he remained “hy-\\n\\npervigilant.” He had trouble concentrating, was sensitive to loud\\n\\nnoises, avoided having his back to doorways or having people behind\\n\\nhim, and had nightmares from which he “would wake up yelling,\\n\\ngasping for air.” He also told the jury that he was prescribed antide-\\n\\npressants and pills to control his nightmares, but they did not help,\\n\\nso he self-medicated with marijuana.\\n\\n                                  6\\n      Because Smith made the substance of his proposed testimony\\n\\nknown to the trial court and received a definitive ruling on the rec-\\n\\nord, the issue is preserved for ordinary appellate review. See OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-1-103 (a); McGarity v. State, \\n311 Ga. 158\\n, 162 (2) (\\n856 SE2d\\n\\n241\\n) (2021) (“to preserve an objection to the exclusion of evidence the\\n\\nproponent must either make an offer of proof or otherwise ensure\\n\\nthat the reason for offering the evidence in question is apparent to\\n\\nthe trial court” (cleaned up)).\\n\\n     On appeal, Smith contends that his PTSD diagnosis is a hear-\\n\\nsay statement and that it is admissible under an exception to the\\n\\ngeneral rule of hearsay. Hearsay is a “statement, other than one\\n\\nmade by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered\\n\\nin evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” OCGA § 24-\\n\\n8-801 (c). Hearsay is generally not admissible, see OCGA § 24-8-802,\\n\\nbut it may be admitted if it falls under any of several statutory ex-\\n\\nceptions. See id. One of those exceptions applies to out-of-court state-\\n\\nments “made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and de-\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   7\\n scribing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sen-\\n\\nsations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external\\n\\nsource thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treat-\\n\\nment.” OCGA § 24-8-803 (4) (“Rule 803 (4)”). In Smith’s view, his\\n\\nPTSD diagnosis fits that exception, and the trial court was wrong to\\n\\nexclude it.\\n\\n     The trial court did not err by excluding Smith’s hearsay state-\\n\\nment that he had PTSD, because the hearsay exception of Rule 803\\n\\n(4) does not apply to medical diagnoses. Instead, the rule applies to\\n\\nout-of-court statements that patients make to medical professionals\\n\\nto help the patients get a diagnosis or treatment. The rule refers to\\n\\nstatements “describing medical history, . . . symptoms, pain, or sen-\\n\\nsations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external\\n\\nsource thereof.” OCGA § 24-8-803 (4). Those are things a patient\\n\\nwould tell a doctor—some of which are uniquely within the patient’s\\n\\nknowledge, like his “pain” and “sensations”—when he is seeking\\n\\ntreatment for a complaint or ailment. Such statements are admissi-\\n\\nble despite being hearsay because the patient has an incentive to tell\\n\\n                                  8\\n the truth under those circumstances. See State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga.\\n\\n553\\n, 561-562 (3) (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018) (“[S]tatements made to a pro-\\n\\nvider for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment may be admissible\\n\\nbecause the self-interested motivation of the declarant in wanting\\n\\neffective diagnosis or treatment . . . makes it more likely that the\\n\\nstatements made for that purpose are true.”) (citing White v. Illinois,\\n\\n502 U.S. 346\\n, 356 (112 SCt 736, 116 LE2d 848) (1992)). And when\\n\\nwe apply Rule 803 (4), we ask whether the statement in question\\n\\nenjoys the “guarantee of trustworthiness” that comes from a pa-\\n\\ntient’s desire to get the right treatment when he describes his symp-\\n\\ntoms to a medical professional. See Smith v. State, \\n309 Ga. 240\\n, 245\\n\\n(2) (b) (\\n845 SE2d 598\\n) (2020) (quoting Almanza, \\n304 Ga. at 559\\n (3))\\n\\n(a statement may be admissible under Rule 803 (4) if (1) the “declar-\\n\\nant’s motive in making the statement is consistent with the pur-\\n\\nposes of treatment” and (2) the statement is of a type “reasonably\\n\\nrelied upon by a physician in treatment or diagnosis” (emphasis\\n\\nadded)). All of which is to say that the language of Rule 803 (4), the\\n\\njustification behind it, and our case law applying it all confirm that\\n\\n                                  9\\n it generally applies to statements made by patients to medical pro-\\n\\nfessionals, not to the resulting diagnoses.\\n\\n     Smith points out that we expect doctors to be honest with their\\n\\npatients, just as we expect patients to be honest with their doctors,\\n\\nso Smith repeating a diagnosis he was given by a doctor should have\\n\\nthe same hallmarks of reliability that allow other types of hearsay\\n\\nto be admitted at trial. But the justification for Rule 803 (4)—the\\n\\n“guarantee of trustworthiness” that attaches to a patient’s factual\\n\\ndescription of his symptoms—does not apply in the same way to a\\n\\ndiagnosis, because a doctor’s diagnosis is generally considered an\\n\\nexpert opinion, not a factual assertion. See, e.g., OCGA § 24-7-701\\n\\n(a) (3) (a witness may not give an opinion that is “based on scientific,\\n\\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge” unless she is qualified as\\n\\nan expert); OCGA § 24-7-704 (b) (restricting an “expert witness tes-\\n\\ntifying with respect to the mental state or condition of an accused in\\n\\na criminal proceeding” from opining on whether the defendant had\\n\\nthe required mental state to be guilty of the charged offense); Mid-\\n\\ndlebrooks v. State, \\n315 Ga. 671\\n, 689-690 (2) (b) (\\n884 SE2d 318\\n) (2023)\\n\\n                                  10\\n (discussing various mental health experts’ opinion testimony about\\n\\nthe defendant’s diagnosis); Adams v. State, \\n275 Ga. 867\\n, 870 (\\n572\\n\\nSE2d 545\\n) (2002) (Carley, J., concurring) (“[s]ince paranoia and\\n\\nschizophrenia are medical terms relating to mental disorders, only\\n\\na qualified expert such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or medical\\n\\ndoctor would be competent to diagnose and define such a mental dis-\\n\\norder” (citation and punctuation omitted)).3 Expert opinions are just\\n\\nthat—opinions—and are subject to different standards of reliability\\n\\nand trustworthiness that govern their admission. See generally\\n\\nOCGA § 24-7-702 (discussing qualifications for experts and expert\\n\\nopinions). We have never, so far as we can tell, applied Rule 803 (4)\\n\\nto determine whether an expert opinion was admissible. 4\\n\\n\\n      3 To be clear, while a diagnosis is generally an expert opinion, doctors\\n\\nand other medical professionals can also provide fact or lay testimony. See\\nMcKelvin v. State, \\n305 Ga. 39\\n, 42-43 (2) (b) (\\n823 SE2d 729\\n) (2019) (distinguish-\\ning between a doctor testifying about his drug-testing decisions and offering\\nhis opinion on whether the defendant could have been on substances that were\\nnot tested for, which would be expert testimony, and the doctor merely report-\\ning the results of the drug tests that were performed, which could be lay testi-\\nmony).\\n      4 To the extent that a patient’s past diagnosis is a fact that could be es-\\n\\ntablished by a lay witness—a question we do not decide here—Smith did not\\nseek to introduce his diagnosis that way. He offered no authenticated medical\\n\\n                                       11\\n       In sum, Rule 803 (4) has consistently been applied to allow the\\n\\nintroduction of statements made to medical professionals, not med-\\n\\nical diagnoses, and Smith cites no authority (nor are we aware of\\n\\nany) supporting the introduction of a medical diagnosis under that\\n\\nrule. The trial court therefore did not err by preventing Smith from\\n\\ntestifying that he had PTSD.\\n\\n      3. Smith also contends that the trial court erred by allowing\\n\\nthe State to impeach Smith with his prior charge under the Uniform\\n\\nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ). We review a trial court’s eviden-\\n\\ntiary rulings for abuse of discretion. See Eubanks v. State, \\n317 Ga.\\n\\n563\\n, 584 (6) (\\n894 SE2d 27\\n) (2023).\\n\\n      Smith had called a character witness, Jerry Mike, Smith’s for-\\n\\nmer sergeant from the military, who testified that he would believe\\n\\nSmith if Smith testified under oath. On cross-examination, the State\\n\\nasked whether Mike’s opinion would change “if [he] learned that\\n\\n\\n\\nrecord or other proof of a past diagnosis. See OCGA § 24-7-701 (a) (defining the\\nlimited circumstances in which a lay witness can provide testimony “in the\\nform of opinions or inferences”). Instead, he sought to testify that doctors had\\ntold him he had PTSD. And as discussed above, he argues that the hearsay\\nexception of Rule 803 (4) allowed him to do so.\\n                                      12\\n Truman Smith has been charged in the military with fraudulent use\\n\\nof another’s identity to avoid arrest or detection under Article 134 of\\n\\nthe Uniform[ ] Code of Military Justice.” Smith objected that he had\\n\\nnever been convicted of that charge, so it was not properly admitted\\n\\nas impeachment evidence. See OCGA § 24-6-609 (allowing for a\\n\\ncriminal defendant to be impeached with prior convictions under\\n\\ncertain circumstances). But the State argued that the question fell\\n\\nunder OCGA § 24-6-608 (b), which allows a party to impeach a wit-\\n\\nness with “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of [the] witness” if the\\n\\nconduct is “probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness.” The trial\\n\\ncourt overruled the objection based on OCGA § 24-6-608 (b), and\\n\\nMike then testified that the UCMJ charge would not change his\\n\\nopinion of Smith’s truthfulness.\\n\\n     When a witness has testified about the truthful character of a\\n\\nsecond witness, as Mike did for Smith, the first witness (here, Mike)\\n\\ncan be cross-examined about specific instances of the second wit-\\n\\nness’s conduct (here, Smith’s conduct) that are probative of the sec-\\n\\nond witness’s character for truthfulness. See OCGA § 24-6-608 (b)\\n\\n                                   13\\n (2). But Smith points out on appeal that his UCMJ charge for fraud-\\n\\nulent use of another’s identity did not contain any information about\\n\\nSmith’s conduct that led to the charge, only that he was administra-\\n\\ntively discharged from the military as a result. In Smith’s view, that\\n\\nmeans the UCMJ charge is not a “specific instance[ ]” of conduct un-\\n\\nder OCGA § 24-6-608 (b) (2).\\n\\n     Assuming without deciding that Smith is right that it was an\\n\\nabuse of discretion to allow the State to ask Mike about the UCMJ\\n\\ncharge, the error was harmless. A non-constitutional evidentiary er-\\n\\nror is harmless if it is “highly probable that the error did not con-\\n\\ntribute to the verdict.” Talley v. State, \\n314 Ga. 153\\n, 160 (2) (\\n875 SE2d\\n\\n789\\n) (2022). That test is satisfied here. At trial it was undisputed\\n\\nthat Smith fatally shot Crawford, so the only question was whether\\n\\nhe did so in self-defense. Both third-party eyewitnesses, Dulles and\\n\\nCastillo, testified that they did not recall any argument between\\n\\nSmith and Crawford and that Smith shot Crawford suddenly and\\n\\nwithout provocation. The only evidence to counter Dulles’s and Cas-\\n\\ntillo’s accounts was Smith’s self-serving testimony that Crawford\\n\\n                                  14\\n had threatened him and appeared to be reaching for a gun. Com-\\n\\npared with that mix of evidence, the fact that Smith had been\\n\\ncharged with the non-violent offense of impersonating another was\\n\\nhighly unlikely to have swayed the jury against him. Indeed, Mike\\n\\neven testified that the UCMJ charge would not affect his opinion of\\n\\nSmith’s truthfulness, which the jury could have viewed as mitigat-\\n\\ning against any prejudice the revelation of the UCMJ charge may\\n\\nhave caused. Because the UCMJ charge was highly unlikely to have\\n\\nmade a difference given the evidence as a whole, any error in allow-\\n\\ning the State to ask about it was harmless. See Johnson v. State, \\n316\\n\\nGa. 672\\n, 683-684 (4) (c) (\\n889 SE2d 914\\n) (2023) (harmless error to\\n\\nadmit single pre-autopsy photo of victim given strong evidence of\\n\\ndefendant’s guilt and the fact that the photo was less graphic, and\\n\\nthus less likely to sway the jury, than other evidence); Young v.\\n\\nState, \\n309 Ga. 529\\n, 536-538 (3) (\\n847 SE2d 347\\n) (2020) (harmless er-\\n\\nror to admit photo of defendant holding a gun where evidence of de-\\n\\nfendant’s guilt was strong and the evidentiary value of the photo\\n\\nwas “marginal”).\\n\\n                                 15\\n Judgment affirmed.

STANFORD KING v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      In 2007, after Stanford King was convicted of two counts of aggravated assault\\nwith intent to commit robbery, he was sentenced to twenty years, with the first seven\\nyears in confinement and the balance on probation. In 2018, after he was convicted of\\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm by a\\nconvicted felon, he was sentenced to fifteen years, with the first four years in\\nconfinement and the balance on probation. In August 2023, the trial court revoked the\\nbalance of King’s probation in both cases. King thereafter filed a pro se motion to\\n“correct a clerical error,” arguing that the underlying indictments were actually “no\\nbills” because the trial court clerk had no minutes from the grand jury showing that\\nit voted to indict him. Given this deficiency, King asserted that any judgments against\\nhim were null and void. When no response was filed, King moved for default\\njudgment on his motion. The trial court denied both motions on March 7, 2024, and\\nKing filed a direct appeal. As explained below, this appeal must be dismissed.\\n      First, to the extent that King challenges his probation revocation, he was\\nrequired to file an application for discretionary appeal to obtain review in this Court.\\nSee OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5); Todd v. State, \\n236 Ga. App. 757\\n, 758 (\\n513 SE2d 287\\n)\\n(1999) (holding that where the underlying subject matter is probation revocation, the\\ndiscretionary appeal procedure applies); accord White v. State, \\n233 Ga. App. 873\\n, 874\\n(\\n505 SE2d 228\\n) (1998).\\n      Second, to the extent King’s motion to correct a clerical error sought to set\\naside or vacate his convictions, a post-conviction motion challenging the validity of a\\n conviction and seeking to set aside or vacate the same is not a valid procedure in a\\ncriminal case. See Roberts v. State, \\n286 Ga. 532\\n, 532 (\\n690 SE2d 150\\n) (2010); Williams\\nv. State, \\n283 Ga. 94\\n, 94 (\\n656 SE2d 144\\n) (2008). A direct appeal may lie from the denial\\nof a motion to correct a void sentence if the defendant raises a colorable claim that the\\nsentence is void. See Burg v. State, \\n297 Ga. App. 118\\n, 119 (\\n676 SE2d 465\\n) (2009). But\\n“[m]otions to vacate a void sentence generally are limited to claims that – even\\nassuming the existence and validity of the conviction for which the sentence was\\nimposed – the law does not authorize that sentence, most typically because it exceeds\\nthe most severe punishment for which the applicable penal statute provides.” von\\nThomas v. State, \\n293 Ga. 569\\n, 572 (2) (\\n748 SE2d 446\\n) (2013).\\n      Here, King’s motion does not allege that his sentence exceeds the maximum\\nallowed by law. Instead, King alleges that any judgments against him are void because\\nhis indictments were flawed. A challenge to the validity of an indictment is a challenge\\nto the conviction rather than the sentence. See Thompson v. State, \\n304 Ga. 146\\n, 149 (3)\\n(\\n816 SE2d 646\\n) (2018); Jones v. State, \\n290 Ga. App. 490\\n, 494 (2) (\\n659 SE2d 875\\n)\\n(2008). The Supreme Court has made clear that a motion seeking to challenge an\\nallegedly invalid or void judgment of conviction “is not one of the established\\nprocedures for challenging the validity of a judgment in a criminal case” and that an\\nappeal from the denial of such a motion is subject to dismissal. Roberts, \\n286 Ga. at 532\\n;\\nHarper v. State, \\n286 Ga. 216\\n, 218 (2) (\\n686 SE2d 786\\n) (2009).\\n      For these reasons, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal, which is hereby\\nDISMISSED.\\n                                         Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\n                                           Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\\n                                                                       05/14/2024\\n                                                    I certify that the above is a true extract from\\n                                         the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\n                                                   Witness my signature and the seal of said court\\n                                         hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                           , Clerk.\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9501808/stanford-king-v-state/'}),\n",

Stone, Casper Rich, contra.\\nQUILLIAN, Justice.\\n1. \"A conspiracy upon which a civil action for damages may be founded is a combination between two or more persons either to do some act which is a tort, or else to do some lawful act by methods which constitute a tort. Where *329 it is sought to impose civil liability for a conspiracy, the conspiracy of itself furnishes no cause of action. The gist of the action, if a cause of action exists, is not the conspiracy alleged, but the tort committed against the plaintiff and the resulting damage. Martha Mills v. Moseley, 50 Ga. App. 536, 538 (2) (179 S.E. 159). Thus, where the act of conspiring is itself legal, the means or method of its accomplishment must be illegal.\" Vandhitch v. Alverson, 52 Ga. App. 308, 310 (1) (183 S.E. 105); Clein v. City of Atlanta, 164 Ga. 529, 534 (139 S.E. 46, 53 A. L. R. 933); Foster v. Skies, 202 Ga. 122 (42 S.E.2d 441); National Bank of Savannah v. Evans, 149 Ga. 67 (99 S.E. 123); Lambert v. Georgia Power Co., 181 Ga. 624, 628 (183 S.E. 814); Johnson v. Ellington, 196 Ga. 847 (28 S.E.2d 114); Luke v. Dupree, 158 Ga. 590, 597 (124 S.E. 13).\\n2. While the conspiracy is not the gravamen of the charge, it may be pleaded and proved as aggravating the wrong of which the plaintiff complains, enabling him to recover in one action against all defendants as joint tortfeasors. National Bank of Savannah v. Evans, 149 Ga. 67, supra; Bentley v. Barlow, 178 Ga. 618 (173 S.E. 707).\\n3. The conspiracy may be pleaded in general terms, and this is true although the jurisdiction of the court to render judgment against one or more of the defendants depends upon allegations and proof of the conspiracy. Peoples Loan Co. v. Allen, 199 Ga. 537, 558 (34 S.E.2d 811); Walker v. Grand International Brotherhood &c. Engineers, 186 Ga. 811, 820 (199 S.E. 146).\\n4. If no cause of action is otherwise alleged, the addition of allegations concerning conspiracy will not make one; but, where a cause of action is alleged, the fact of conspiracy, if proved, makes any actionable deed by one of the conspirators chargeable to all. Young v. Wilson, 183 Ga. 59 (187 S.E. 44); Horton v. Johnson, 187 Ga. 9 (5) (199 S.E. 226); Wall v. Wall, 176 Ga. 757 (4) (168 S.E. 893); Grant v. Hart, 192 Ga. 153, 156 (5) (14 S.E.2d 860); Peoples Loan Co. v. Allen, 199 Ga. 537, supra. The liability is joint and several. Smith v. Manning, 155 Ga. 209 (2) (116 S.E. 813).\\n5. \"The law recognizes the intrinsic difficulty of proving a conspiracy. The allegations with reference to conspiracy are treated as matters of inducement leading up to a more particular *330 description of the acts from which conspiracy may be inferred.. . Less certainty is required in setting out matters of inducement than in setting out the gist of the action. . . The conspiracy may sometimes be inferred from the nature of the acts done, the relation of the parties, the interests of the alleged conspirators, and other circumstances. The rule is to allow great latitude in setting out in the complaint the particular act upon which the conspiracy is to be inferred, and even to allow individual acts of the conspirators to be averred. `To show conspiracy it is not necessary to prove an express compact or agreement among the parties thereto. The essential element of the charge is the common design; but it need not appear that the parties met together either formally or informally and entered into any explicit or formal agreement; nor is it essential that it should appear that either by words or writing they formulated their unlawful objects. It is sufficient that two or more persons in any manner either positively or tacitly come to a mutual understanding that they will accomplish the unlawful design.

Where, under an application of the announced principles of law in the foregoing divisions of the syllabus, in an action for damages against three named defendants, it is alleged that the defendants have damaged the petitioner in a named amount by their wilful, deliberate, wrongful, and unlawful deeds, omissions, silences, breaches of trust, loyalty, and *331 confidence, committed or omitted pursuant to a conspiracy among them unlawfully to destroy and ruin the petitioner\\'s printing business by establishing a competitive printing business; and it is alleged that one of the defendants was the petitioner\\'s general manager in charge of the printing business and occupied a confidential and fiduciary relationship to the petitioner as his general agent; that another of the defendants, acting as an official, agent, and employee, as president of the third defendant, a corporation receiving and retaining the benefits of its president\\'s acts, bore a confidential and fiduciary relationship to the petitioner, as his agent, employed to effectuate a sale of the petitioner\\'s printing business as a going concern; and it is alleged that the first defendant set up a competitive printing business; converted funds, materials, supplies, and equipment belonging to the petitioner\\'s business for use in the competitive business; used the petitioner\\'s facilities and labor to print material advertising the competitive business; used petitioner\\'s ledger of accounts listing his customers to solicit business for the competitive business; and induced named employees of the petitioner to breach their contracts of employment with the petitioner and accept employment in the competitive business; and it is alleged that the second defendant kept silent when he knew that the first defendant was setting up a competitive business, and assured the petitioner that the first defendant was co-operating with him fully in the sale of the petitioner\\'s business, when such was not the case; and it is alleged that the third defendant, through its president, the second defendant, sold enumerated items of machinery and equipment to the first defendant for use in his competitive business, all of which acts are alleged to have been performed pursuant to the combination among the defendants to unlawfully destroy and ruin the petitioner\\'s business \\x97 the petition stated a cause of action against each of the defendants as against the second and third defendants\\' general demurrers.\\n8. Where, in such a case as indicated in the foregoing division, the petitioner amends by alleging that the acts and doings of the second defendant, its president, were authorized and ratified by the corporate third defendant, such amendment is not objectionable as adding a new cause of action or a new party defendant. \"A corporation can act only by its agents, yet for *332 such acts it is responsible, and a simple direct statement that it committed a tortious act by the agent makes the corporation responsible.

Where, in such a case as indicated, it is alleged that the petitioner has been damaged in a stated sum by the defendant conspirators\\' destruction of his business, such allegation is not subject to special demurrer for failure to itemize the damage.

THE STATE v. LEDBETTER.\\n                   S23X0901. LEDBETTER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n       WARREN, Justice.\\n\\n       In October 2018, John Ledbetter was indicted for murder and\\n\\nother crimes associated with the January 2016 shooting death of\\n\\nJeremy Miller and the unrelated February 2015 shooting death of\\n\\nDamian Stinchcomb. Before trial, Ledbetter filed two motions to\\n\\nsuppress evidence. One motion sought to suppress evidence related\\n\\nto Miller’s shooting provided to Detective Kevin Leonpacher by\\n\\nLedbetter’s previous attorney, Dennis Scheib, on the ground that the\\n\\ninformation was protected by attorney-client privilege. The other\\n\\nmotion sought to suppress cell phone records related to Miller’s\\n\\nshooting and cell phone records related Stinchcomb’s shooting on the\\n\\nground that the two warrants authorizing the search of his cell\\n\\nphone records were defective in several respects, including not being\\n supported by probable cause.          The trial court granted the first\\n\\nmotion to suppress, and the State appeals. See OCGA § 5-7-1 (a) (5)\\n\\n(permitting the State to appeal from a pretrial order excluding\\n\\nevidence under certain conditions).          The trial court denied the\\n\\nsecond motion to suppress, and Ledbetter cross-appeals. See OCGA\\n\\n§ 5-7-1 (b) (“In any instances in which any appeal is taken by and on\\n\\nbehalf of the State of Georgia in a criminal case, the defendant shall\\n\\nhave the right to cross appeal.”). For the reasons explained below,\\n\\nwe affirm both orders. Because each appeal has its own relevant\\n\\nfacts and legal issues, we discuss them separately, addressing the\\n\\nState’s pretrial appeal first.\\n\\n      1. The State’s Appeal, Case No. S23A0900\\n\\n      (a) Miller was shot during a drug transaction on January 19,\\n\\n2016, and later died in the hospital. 1 During the investigation into\\n\\nthe shooting, Scheib, Ledbetter’s attorney at the time, contacted law\\n\\nenforcement, and on February 5, 2016, he met with Detective\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 Stinchcomb’s murder is not at issue in the State’s appeal and will be\\n\\ndiscussed below in Division 2, which pertains to Ledbetter’s cross-appeal.\\n                                      2\\n Leonpacher about the investigation and gave the detective\\n\\ninformation about the shooting, as well as physical evidence related\\n\\nto the shooting. Ledbetter was later arrested for Miller’s murder.\\n\\n      After Ledbetter changed attorneys, his new trial counsel\\n\\nmoved to suppress “all evidence provided to law enforcement” by\\n\\nScheib based on attorney-client privilege. 2 At a hearing on this\\n\\nmotion, the following evidence about Scheib’s meeting with\\n\\nDetective Leonpacher was presented.\\n\\n      Detective Leonpacher testified that Scheib contacted him\\n\\nshortly after Miller’s shooting, “essentially gauging what the police\\n\\nknew about the incident.” Scheib was “very clear about having some\\n\\nlimited information from his client and he proffered some\\n\\ngeneralized details of the incident . . . in somewhat hypothetical\\n\\nterms.” In a second call later that day, Scheib stated that Ledbetter\\n\\nwas his client. The detective then met with Scheib at Scheib’s office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Ledbetter also argued to the trial court that the evidence should be\\n\\nsuppressed based on Scheib’s providing ineffective assistance of counsel, but\\nthat is not the ground on which the trial court relied in granting Ledbetter’s\\nmotion to suppress, and Ledbetter does not pursue that argument on appeal.\\n                                      3\\n      The meeting at Scheib’s office was audio-recorded by the\\n\\ndetective, and the recording was played at the hearing. Scheib first\\n\\ngave the detective information about the vehicle involved in the\\n\\nshooting.   He explained that it was a rental car and gave the\\n\\ndetective the name and number of the person at the rental car\\n\\ncompany to contact about the car.            Scheib then provided the\\n\\nfollowing account of the shooting. 3 Ledbetter knew Miller “from\\n\\nbefore,” and he and Miller arranged to meet each other in the\\n\\nparking lot to “talk about” a marijuana transaction. In the parking\\n\\nlot, Miller got into the passenger’s side of Ledbetter’s car and then\\n\\npulled out a “chrome and black automatic pistol.” Ledbetter put his\\n\\nhands up in the air and then reached out and grabbed the gun. They\\n\\nstruggled. As Ledbetter pushed the gun away, it went off. Miller\\n\\ntold Ledbetter that he had another gun. Ledbetter threw himself\\n\\nover Miller, and as soon as Ledbetter had control over the gun, he\\n\\n“fired twice.”\\n\\n\\n     3 During this account, Scheib repeatedly prefaced statements about the\\n\\nshooting with “he said” or “he told me,” indicating that Ledbetter had given\\nhim this information.\\n                                     4\\n       Scheib also gave the detective physical evidence, including a\\n\\nbackpack that Ledbetter said Miller was carrying when he entered\\n\\nthe vehicle, the clothes Ledbetter was wearing on the night of the\\n\\nshooting, and two guns, at least one of which Scheib indicated\\n\\nLedbetter had taken from Miller. 4 At the end of the meeting, Scheib\\n\\ntold Detective Leonpacher that Ledbetter had said that if the\\n\\ndetective secured an arrest warrant for Ledbetter, Ledbetter would\\n\\nturn himself in within 24 hours because he did not want the “fugitive\\n\\nsquad” looking for him. Scheib further explained that Ledbetter had\\n\\nsaid, “I’m not gonna run,” and “I gotta deal with this.” Scheib never\\n\\nstated that Ledbetter had waived attorney-client privilege or given\\n\\nScheib permission to share any of this information.\\n\\n      Detective Leonpacher testified that when talking to Scheib, he\\n\\nwas under the impression that Scheib was acting as an agent for\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 When describing the incident to the detective, Scheib said Ledbetter\\n\\ndescribed the gun Miller had as a “chrome and black automatic pistol,” and\\nthen said, “I’ll show you the gun that my client gave me.” After Scheib gave\\nthe detective the gun, he said, “He’s given you the weapon, and he’s described\\nit as a silver and black weapon.” Scheib also gave the detective socks, a cap, a\\nnecklace, a receipt, and a shell casing.\\n                                       5\\n Ledbetter, noting that Scheib used Ledbetter’s and Miller’s names\\n\\nin his description of the incident, rather than using hypothetical\\n\\nnames. The detective also recalled that as Scheib was providing\\n\\ndetails, Scheib referred to his notes, leading the detective to\\n\\n“presume[] . . . that [Scheib] had spoken with his client and made\\n\\nsome notes and was trying to reproduce to me the information\\n\\nprovided by his client to him.”         Scheib did not provide and the\\n\\ndetective never saw “anything that said that there was some sort of\\n\\nwaiver of attorney-client privilege” allowing Scheib to provide this\\n\\nproffer.\\n\\n     Scheib testified that he was trying to use “hypotheticals” to\\n\\n“guide [Detective Leonpacher] toward looking into Mr. Miller as a\\n\\nrobber” who had a weapon.            Scheib explained, “I was using\\n\\nhypotheticals because I knew I couldn’t say my client has actually\\n\\nsaid this without my client giving up the attorney-client privilege.”5\\n\\nScheib testified that Ledbetter had not waived attorney-client\\n\\n\\n     5 The recording of the interview does not reflect that Scheib spoke in\\nhypotheticals.\\n\\n                                    6\\n privilege or given him permission to share what Ledbetter told\\n\\nScheib with “the police, the prosecution, or anybody else”; Scheib\\n\\nalso did not have authority from Ledbetter to say that any of the\\n\\nitems he gave the detective came from Ledbetter. Scheib further\\n\\ntestified that Ledbetter wrote him a letter with specific information\\n\\nabout what he wanted to do “as far as turning himself in.” 6\\n\\n      Ledbetter testified that he never gave Scheib permission to\\n\\nreveal private communications or share physical evidence. When he\\n\\nlearned in 2018 that Scheib had given information to Detective\\n\\nLeonpacher, he “contact[ed] the fee arbitration people” because he\\n\\n“felt like [Scheib] needed to be disbarred and I needed my money\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      6  During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Scheib if he\\nremembered telling the prosecutor that Ledbetter had “signed a document that\\nwas in [Scheib’s] file that allowed [Scheib] to say certain things to Detective\\nLeonpacher about the case.” Scheib did not state whether he recalled making\\nthat statement, but testified that he “may have misspoken” and clarified that\\nLedbetter wrote him “several letters as to what to do and what not to do,” but\\nScheib did not have any letters allowing him “to go in and give certain things.”\\n\\n                                       7\\n returned.”7 And Ledbetter hired a different attorney to represent\\n\\nhim going forward.\\n\\n     (b) On December 6, 2021, the trial court granted Ledbetter’s\\n\\nmotion to suppress evidence provided by Scheib, finding, based on\\n\\nthe evidence presented at the hearing that:\\n\\n     Scheib obtained privileged information from Defendant\\n     Ledbetter during the course of legal representation. This\\n     information included statements as well as physical\\n     evidence. Attorney Scheib, unilaterally and without\\n     knowledge or permission of Defendant Ledbetter, and in\\n     violation of the attorney-client privilege, violated this\\n     statutory privilege and unlawfully shared this privileged\\n     information/evidence with law enforcement. This was\\n     error.\\n\\nCiting OCGA § 24-5-501 (a) (2) and several cases, the trial court\\n\\ntherefore ruled that “[i]n order to cure this error, the prosecution as\\n\\nwell as all of its witnesses are hereby notified that they are not to\\n\\nuse, directly or indirectly, any privileged evidence obtained from\\n\\nAttorney Scheib which includes, but is not limited to, Defendant’s\\n\\nstatements as well as physical evidence provided by Attorney Scheib\\n\\n\\n     7 It is not clear from the record whether Ledbetter was referencing the\\n\\nfee arbitration program at the State Bar, the General Counsel’s office at the\\nState Bar, or some other person or entity.\\n                                     8\\n to Homicide Detective Leonpacher.” The order further held that “it\\n\\ncannot be mentioned that Attorney Scheib ever met with the police\\n\\n. . . and Attorney Scheib cannot be called as a witness at trial by the\\n\\nState.”\\n\\n     The State appeals the trial court’s grant of Ledbetter’s motion\\n\\nto suppress, arguing that Ledbetter has not shown a violation of\\n\\nattorney-client privilege through any of Scheib’s communications.\\n\\nThe State further argues that, even if there was a violation of\\n\\nLedbetter’s attorney-client privilege, the physical evidence provided\\n\\nby Scheib to Detective Leonpacher should not be suppressed, and\\n\\nthe State should be permitted to present evidence of the source of\\n\\nthe physical evidence, i.e., that it came from Scheib, Ledbetter’s\\n\\nattorney. Finally, the State argues that the trial court erred by\\n\\nsuppressing “derivative evidence”—that is, evidence derived from\\n\\nScheib’s statements to Detective Leonpacher.\\n\\n     For the reasons discussed below, we agree with the trial court\\n\\nthat Ledbetter has shown that his attorney-client privilege was\\n\\nviolated through Scheib’s disclosures to Detective Leonpacher. And\\n\\n                                  9\\n because Ledbetter concedes that physical evidence is not suppressed\\n\\nby the trial court order at issue in this appeal, we need not decide\\n\\nwhether the trial court could have suppressed the physical evidence\\n\\nLedbetter gave to Scheib based on attorney-client privilege.\\n\\nHowever, we conclude that the trial court’s order properly prohibits\\n\\nthe State from presenting evidence to the jury that Scheib,\\n\\nLedbetter’s attorney, was the source of the physical evidence given\\n\\nto law enforcement. Finally, we conclude that the trial court order\\n\\ndoes not suppress “derivative evidence” as protected by attorney-\\n\\nclient privilege. We therefore affirm the trial court’s order granting\\n\\nLedbetter’s motion to suppress the evidence provided by Scheib.8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      8 The State and Ledbetter both mention certain videos of interviews with\\n\\npotential witnesses that Scheib allegedly gave to Detective Leonpacher.\\nEvidence in the record indicates that Scheib provided these videos to the\\ndetective at some point after his recorded meeting with the detective. These\\nvideos were briefly mentioned by Detective Leonpacher at the motion to\\nsuppress hearing, but no clear evidence was presented about their contents or\\nwhen and how they were given to the detective. Ledbetter now argues that\\nthese recordings must be suppressed as protected attorney work product. We\\ndo not address that argument, however, because it appears that it was not\\nraised by Ledbetter in the trial court, and it was not ruled on in the suppression\\norder at issue in this appeal.\\n\\n                                       10\\n       (c) “The attorney-client privilege is ‘the oldest of the privileges\\n\\nfor confidential communications known to the common law,’” and\\n\\n“has long been recognized in Georgia.” St. Simons Waterfront, LLC\\n\\nv.

To that end, OCGA § 24-5-501 (a)\\n\\n(2) prevents evidence protected by the attorney-client privilege from\\n\\nbeing introduced as evidence: “There are certain admissions and\\n\\ncommunications excluded from evidence on grounds of public policy,\\n\\nincluding, but not limited to, the following: . . . Communications\\n\\nbetween attorney and client.” See also St. Simons Waterfront, \\n293\\n\\nGa. at 421\\n (explaining that the “attorney-client privilege” is\\n\\n“currently codified” in OCGA § 24-5-501 (a) (2)).9\\n\\n\\n      9 As noted in St. Simons Waterfront, “[p]rior to the adoption of the 2013\\n\\nGeorgia Evidence Code, there were four different statutes in our evidence code\\naddressing the attorney-client privilege.” Id. at 421 n.1. The current Evidence\\nCode “greatly simplified the statutory language constituting the privilege and\\neliminated certain awkward language in the prior statutes,” but “the rules\\ngoverning the privilege in Georgia generally remain the same.” Id. (citation\\nand punctuation omitted). Neither party has argued that any aspect of\\nattorney-client privilege at issue in this case changed with the introduction of\\nthe current Evidence Code, and we conclude that at least as to the issues raised\\n\\n                                      11\\n       “The [attorney-client] privilege generally attaches when legal\\n\\nadvice is sought from an attorney, and operates to protect from\\n\\ncompelled disclosure any communications, made in confidence,\\n\\nrelating to the matter on which the client seeks advice.” St. Simons\\n\\nWaterfront, \\n293 Ga. at 421-422\\n.

Moody, \\n308 Ga. 74\\n, 79 (\\n839 SE2d 535\\n) (2020).\\n\\n     (i) Attorney-Client Communications\\n\\n     In granting Ledbetter’s motion to suppress evidence that was\\n\\nshared in violation of Ledbetter’s attorney-client privilege, the trial\\n\\ncourt found that Scheib “obtained privileged information from\\n\\nDefendant Ledbetter during the course of legal representation,” and\\n\\nthat Scheib shared this information “unilaterally and without\\n\\nknowledge or permission of Defendant Ledbetter.” We review these\\n\\nfact-findings for clear error. See State v. Wilson, \\n315 Ga. 613\\n, 613\\n\\n(\\n884 SE2d 298\\n) (2023) (“In reviewing the trial court’s grant of the\\n\\nmotion to suppress, we apply the well-established principles that the\\n\\ntrial court’s findings as to disputed facts will be upheld unless\\n\\nclearly erroneous and the trial court’s application of the law to\\n\\nundisputed facts is subject to de novo review.”) (punctuation and\\n\\ncitation omitted).\\n\\n     The State does not dispute that Scheib obtained information\\n\\nfrom Ledbetter as part of his representation of Ledbetter and that\\n\\n                                  13\\n Scheib then conveyed that information to Detective Leonpacher.\\n\\nAnd the trial court’s findings that Scheib acted “unilaterally” and\\n\\n“without knowledge or permission” of Ledbetter were supported by\\n\\nample evidence that Ledbetter did not waive his attorney-client\\n\\nprivilege, including Scheib’s testimony that he did not have any\\n\\nwaiver or permission to share information from Ledbetter and\\n\\nLedbetter’s testimony that he never gave Scheib permission to share\\n\\nany information with the detective and did not learn about Scheib’s\\n\\ndisclosures until 2018.\\n\\n     The State argues, however, that Scheib did not share the\\n\\ninformation “unilaterally” and without Ledbetter’s “knowledge or\\n\\npermission” because, in fact, Ledbetter intended for Scheib to share\\n\\nthe information he provided with Detective Leonpacher and thereby\\n\\nimplicitly waived his attorney-client privilege. In support of this\\n\\ncontention, the State points to “[t]he fact that Scheib disclosed this\\n\\ninformation while pursuing [a] favorable outcome for Ledbetter.”\\n\\nBut in the absence of any evidence that the client knew about and\\n\\napproved of the disclosure, an attorney’s disclosure alone, even if it\\n\\n                                 14\\n was intended to benefit the client, does not establish that such\\n\\ndisclosure was authorized.

See Kennestone Hosp.\\n\\nv. Hopson, \\n273 Ga. 145\\n, 148 (\\n538 SE2d 742\\n) (2000) (explaining that\\n\\n\\n      10 In support of this argument, the State cites United States v.

Even assuming we would follow\\nthese federal cases in deciding an issue about attorney-client privilege, both\\ncases are distinguishable: there was evidence in both that the defendants knew\\nabout their attorneys’ disclosures. See Tyerman, 701 F3d at 559 (explaining\\nthat during plea negotiations, Tyerman helped his attorney find the gun “[a]t\\nthe Court’s request” and “the County Attorney’s request,” and concluding that\\nTyerman implicitly waived the attorney-client privilege as to that\\ninformation); Beltramea, 2015 U.S. Dist.

We cannot say that the trial court’s finding that\\n\\nScheib acted without Ledbetter’s knowledge or permission was\\n\\nclearly erroneous. 11 We therefore affirm the trial court’s holding\\n\\nthat Ledbetter’s communications with Scheib were protected by the\\n\\n\\n\\n      11  The State also argues in its reply brief that the statement of\\nLedbetter’s new attorney at an August 2020 bond hearing that Ledbetter “had\\nengaged the services of an attorney, Dennis Scheib, and in fact was cooperating\\nand providing information and physical evidence to Detective Leonpacher”\\nshows that Ledbetter authorized the disclosures Scheib made to the detective.\\nFirst, we note that it does not appear the State made this argument to the trial\\ncourt, and evidence about what was said during the bond hearing was not\\nintroduced into evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress. See\\nMiddleton v. State, \\n316 Ga. 808\\n, 810 n.3 (\\n890 SE2d 713\\n) (2023) (declining to\\nconsider an argument that was “never raised in proceedings below”). Even if\\nwe did consider this argument, however, we would reject it. This statement\\nfrom Ledbetter’s counsel was not a clear representation on Ledbetter’s behalf\\nthat he had waived his attorney-client privilege in relation to Scheib’s earlier\\nmeeting with Detective Leonpacher, and later in the bond hearing, Ledbetter’s\\ncounsel indicated to the court that Scheib’s disclosure of evidence to law\\nenforcement was “among some of the things” that Ledbetter would be raising\\nbefore the trial court. Even if counsel’s assertion that Ledbetter “was\\ncooperating” with the State through Scheib was inconsistent with Ledbetter’s\\nassertion that he did not authorize Scheib to make any disclosures to law\\nenforcement, it does not constitute a sufficiently clear statement that\\nLedbetter authorized Scheib’s disclosures to cause us to conclude that the trial\\ncourt’s fact-finding was clearly erroneous.\\n\\n                                      17\\n attorney-client privilege and should be suppressed under OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-5-501 (a) (2).\\n\\n      (ii) Physical Evidence\\n\\n      The State also argues that even if evidence about the\\n\\ncommunications between Ledbetter and Scheib that Scheib shared\\n\\nwith Detective Leonpacher should be suppressed based on attorney-\\n\\nclient privilege, the trial court order should be reversed to the extent\\n\\nit also suppresses physical evidence Scheib gave the detective, such\\n\\nas guns. Notably, however, in his brief and at oral argument before\\n\\nthis Court, Ledbetter asserted that the trial court’s order does not\\n\\ncategorically suppress physical evidence itself and has conceded that\\n\\nthe physical evidence is not covered by attorney-client privilege and\\n\\nmay be admissible.12 In other words, the State and Ledbetter agree\\n\\n\\n\\n      12 Specifically, in one of his appellate briefs before this Court, Ledbetter\\n\\nasserted: “The trial court did not exclude the physical evidence from being\\nintroduced at trial but it did exclude all privileged evidence that was obtained\\nby the prosecution in violation of Appellee’s rights. Thus, if the prosecution\\ncan find a lawful way to introduce the physical evidence at trial, same would\\nnot violate the trial court’s Order.” And at oral argument, Ledbetter’s counsel\\nwas asked: “[I]t seems like you concede that the physical evidence is not\\ncovered by attorney-client privilege or any other privilege. Is that your\\nposition?” And counsel answered, “In this particular case, yes.”\\n                                       18\\n on this point. We accept Ledbetter’s interpretation of the trial court\\n\\norder and hold that the order does not suppress the physical\\n\\nevidence Scheib provided to Detective Leonpacher. 13\\n\\n      However, if the physical evidence is admitted at trial, it should\\n\\nnot be linked to Scheib as Ledbetter’s attorney. 14                 Ledbetter\\n\\nasserts—and we agree—that although the trial court’s order does\\n\\nnot suppress the physical evidence itself, the trial court order does\\n\\nprohibit    the   State    from    identifying     Scheib—as      Ledbetter’s\\n\\nattorney—as the source of any physical evidence the State might\\n\\nseek to introduce. Specifically, the trial court’s order prohibits “the\\n\\nprosecution as well as all of its witnesses” from using “directly, or\\n\\n\\n\\n      13 To the extent language in the order could be read to suppress the\\n\\nphysical evidence itself, we reject that reading. And because this Court’s\\ninterpretation of the trial court’s order is now law of the case, Ledbetter may\\nnot later attempt to rely on that order in an effort to suppress the physical\\nevidence at issue in this appeal. See Cartwright v. Caldwell, \\n305 Ga. 371\\n, 382\\n(\\n825 SE2d 168\\n) (2019) (“Under [the law of the case] doctrine, ‘any ruling by the\\nSupreme Court or the Court of Appeals in a case shall be binding in all\\nsubsequent proceedings in that case in the lower court and in the Supreme\\nCourt or the Court of Appeals.’ OCGA § 9-11-60 (h). It is well-established that\\nthe law of the case doctrine applies to holdings by appellate courts in criminal\\ncases.”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      14 We do not evaluate how the State may be able to admit this physical\\n\\nevidence, such as through a different theory of authentication.\\n                                      19\\n indirectly, any privileged evidence obtained from Attorney Scheib\\n\\nwhich includes . . . physical evidence provided by Attorney Scheib.”\\n\\nThe State would violate this prohibition if it introduced at trial the\\n\\nphysical evidence Ledbetter gave to Scheib accompanied by\\n\\ntestimony or other evidence that the items originated from Scheib\\n\\n(who was serving as Ledbetter’s attorney). This is so because the\\n\\nevidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing indicated that\\n\\nLedbetter (as a client) gave the physical evidence to Scheib\\n\\n(Ledbetter’s attorney) as part of his attorney-client communications\\n\\nwith Scheib.\\n\\n     Scheib’s explanation of the “chrome and black” gun he gave\\n\\nDetective Ledbetter, which is reflected in the recording of the\\n\\nmeeting played at the motion to suppress hearing, helps illustrate\\n\\nthis point. Scheib’s statements to Detective Leonpacher indicate\\n\\nthat when Ledbetter gave Scheib this gun, Ledbetter told Scheib it\\n\\nwas the gun Miller had when he arrived at the drug transaction and\\n\\nthat Miller and Ledbetter struggled over it, eventually resulting in\\n\\nMiller’s shooting and death. If the State sought to introduce that\\n\\n                                 20\\n gun into evidence at trial and mentioned that law enforcement\\n\\nofficials obtained the gun through Ledbetter’s attorney, Scheib, that\\n\\nwould constitute an indirect use of “privileged evidence obtained\\n\\nfrom Attorney Scheib” and would violate the trial court’s order. That\\n\\nwould be so even if neither Ledbetter’s nor Scheib’s statements\\n\\nabout the gun were repeated to the jury and even if the fact of\\n\\nScheib’s conversations with Ledbetter and Detective Leonpacher\\n\\nwere not otherwise made known to the jury.                   Evidence that\\n\\nLedbetter’s attorney gave law enforcement a gun that was linked to\\n\\nthe shooting would be indirect evidence of the communications\\n\\nLedbetter had with Scheib (his attorney) when he gave Scheib this\\n\\ngun, thereby constituting the type of indirect use of “privileged\\n\\nevidence obtained from Attorney Scheib” the trial court prohibited\\n\\nin its order.15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      15We note that it likely would be difficult to present evidence that\\nLedbetter’s attorney Scheib gave any physical evidence to Detective\\nLeonpacher without running afoul of the trial court’s directive that “it cannot\\nbe mentioned that Attorney Scheib ever met with the police.”\\n                                      21\\n      The State argues that it should be allowed to present evidence\\n\\nthat the gun and other physical evidence came from Scheib and the\\n\\ntrial court erred in deciding otherwise. Responding to the State’s\\n\\nargument, Ledbetter points to Williams v. State, \\n258 Ga. 281\\n (\\n368\\n\\nSE2d 742\\n) (1988), and maintains that the trial court’s suppression\\n\\nof any mention of his attorney as the source of any physical evidence\\n\\nis proper.   We agree with Ledbetter.        In Williams, the State\\n\\npresented evidence to the jury that the attorney of Williams, a\\n\\ncriminal defendant, revealed the location of a murder victim’s body\\n\\nto law enforcement. See \\n258 Ga. at 284\\n. This Court explained that\\n\\nthe attorney, Flanagan, likely learned this information from\\n\\nWilliams and reasoned that “if the state was not trying to create an\\n\\ninference that the victim’s body was discovered because Williams\\n\\nhad revealed its location to his attorney, it was not necessary to tell\\n\\nthe jury that Flanagan was Williams’ attorney.” \\nId.\\n We therefore\\n\\ndisapproved of the State’s presenting evidence that the defendant’s\\n\\nattorney was the source of the evidence used against the defendant.\\n\\nSee \\nid.\\n\\n\\n                                  22\\n      It is true, as the State points out, that this Court in Williams\\n\\nultimately held that evidence of Williams’s attorney’s involvement\\n\\nwas harmless in light of the strength of the evidence against\\n\\nWilliams. See \\n258 Ga. at 285\\n. But the reasoning in Williams is\\n\\nnonetheless persuasive here. As with admitting evidence of the\\n\\nattorney’s knowledge of the body’s location in Williams, admitting\\n\\nevidence that Ledbetter’s attorney was the source of the physical\\n\\nevidence given to Detective Leonpacher would allow the jury to draw\\n\\ninferences about Ledbetter’s communications with his attorney\\n\\nScheib that should not be permitted because of the attorney-client\\n\\nprivilege.   To put it another way, the only reason Scheib gave\\n\\nDetective Leonpacher the physical items was because of their\\n\\nconnection to the shooting, and the only reason Scheib was aware of\\n\\nthe items’ connection to the shooting was through his privileged\\n\\ncommunications with his client. And the information discussed in\\n\\nthose privileged communications—whether presented directly\\n\\nthrough Scheib’s statements about what Ledbetter said or presented\\n\\nindirectly through inferences that can be drawn from the fact that\\n\\n                                 23\\n Ledbetter shared physical evidence of the crimes with his attorney—\\n\\nis what the attorney-client privilege protects from the jury’s view.16\\n\\nThus, we affirm the trial court’s suppression of evidence that Scheib\\n\\n(as Ledbetter’s attorney) was the source of the physical evidence.17\\n\\n      (iii) Derivative Evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      16 Other states have reached a similar conclusion.   For example, in State\\nv. Olwell, \\n64 Wash.2d 828\\n (\\n394 P2d 681\\n) (1964), which Williams cited with\\napproval, the Supreme Court of Washington held that when an attorney\\nsurrenders physical “evidence he has in his possession,” the prosecution\\n“should be well aware of the existence of the attorney-client privilege” and\\n“when attempting to introduce such evidence at the trial, should take extreme\\nprecautions to make certain that the source of the evidence is not disclosed in\\nthe presence of the jury.” \\nId. at 834\\n. That court reasoned that by “allowing\\nthe prosecution to recover such evidence, the public interest is served, and by\\nrefusing the prosecution an opportunity to disclose the source of the evidence,\\nthe client’s privilege is preserved and a balance is reached between these\\nconflicting interests.” \\nId.\\n See also Sanford v. State, \\n21 SW3d 337\\n, 344 (Tex.\\nApp. 2000) (explaining that “several other jurisdictions hold that the State may\\nnot, when introducing the evidence received from counsel, reveal the source of\\nthe evidence in the presence of the jury because it would violate the attorney-\\nclient privilege” and concluding that “this balancing of interests is the correct\\napproach”); State v. Abdullah, 348 P3d 1, 103-104 (\\n158 Idaho 386\\n) (2015)\\n(collecting cases prohibiting presenting the defendant’s attorney as the source\\nof physical evidence, but also explaining that if the location of physical\\nevidence “was revealed to defense counsel by a non-client third party, then the\\nattorney-client privilege does not prohibit the State from proving . . . where\\nand how the evidence was located”).\\n\\n      17 We take no position, however, on the question of whether Ledbetter\\n\\ncould open the door to such evidence by raising a chain-of-custody or similar\\nchallenge at trial.\\n                                       24\\n      The State also argues that the trial court erred by suppressing\\n\\n“derivative evidence related to Scheib’s disclosures,” such as\\n\\ntestimony from witnesses later located with information Scheib\\n\\nprovided to Detective Leonpacher. See Black’s Law Dictionary (11th\\n\\ned. 2019) (defining “derivative evidence” as “[e]vidence that is later\\n\\ndiscovered by using evidence that was illegally obtained”).       We\\n\\ndisagree, however, with the premise of the State’s argument in this\\n\\nregard, because the trial court’s order does not suppress such\\n\\nevidence.\\n\\n     As discussed in subdivision (ii) above, the trial court’s order\\n\\nprohibits “the prosecution as well as all of its witnesses” from\\n\\n“indirectly” using “privileged information obtained from Attorney\\n\\nScheib.” But the order does not otherwise restrict law enforcement’s\\n\\nuse of the privileged information to aid further investigation.\\n\\nMoreover, the text of the order does not mention “derivative\\n\\nevidence” and neither OCGA § 24-5-501 (a) (2) nor any of the cases\\n\\nthe trial court cited in the order expressly suppress derivative\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 25\\n evidence on the basis of attorney-client privilege.18 The order also\\n\\ndoes not hold that Ledbetter’s constitutional rights were violated,\\n\\nwhich is often a pre-requisite for the suppression of derivative\\n\\nevidence. See State v. Chulpayev, \\n296 Ga. 764\\n, 776 (\\n770 SE2d 808\\n)\\n\\n(2015) (“The broad exclusionary rule, with its fruit of the poisonous\\n\\ntree extension, operates only in limited circumstances, usually only\\n\\nwhere a defendant’s constitutional rights have been violated.”).\\n\\nFinally, at oral argument before this Court, Ledbetter’s counsel\\n\\nappeared to acknowledge that the trial court’s order does not\\n\\nsuppress “derivative evidence,” while emphasizing the court’s\\n\\nprohibition on the indirect use of the privileged information\\n\\ndiscussed in subdivision (ii) above.19 We accordingly conclude that\\n\\n\\n      18  We acknowledge that the title of the order broadly describes its\\ncontents as an order “GRANTING THE SUPPRESSION OF ANY AND ALL\\nEVIDENCE, AS WELL AS DERIVATIVE EVIDENCE.” However, for the\\nreasons explained in this subdivision, we do not view the nomenclature in the\\ntitle of the order as prevailing over the substance of the order. See Sotter v.\\nStephens, \\n291 Ga. 79\\n, 82 (\\n727 SE2d 484\\n) (2012) (explaining that although it\\nwas titled “Final Order and Judgment,” the order was not final because the\\nsubstance of the order indicated that it was interlocutory).\\n\\n      19 Specifically, when counsel was asked at oral argument about what\\n\\nderivative evidence was suppressed by the trial court’s order, he answered: “I\\n\\n                                      26\\n the trial court’s order does not prohibit the State from seeking to\\n\\nintroduce evidence that may be obtained from the use of privileged\\n\\ninformation Scheib disclosed to Detective Leonpacher, so long as\\n\\nthat evidence does not reveal communications protected by the\\n\\nattorney-client privilege and so long as the State does not identify\\n\\nScheib as the original source of any such evidence.\\n\\n                                       *\\n\\n      In light of the discussion above, we affirm the trial court’s order\\n\\ngranting Ledbetter’s motion to suppress any evidence that attorney\\n\\nScheib gave to Detective Leonpacher that is protected by Ledbetter’s\\n\\nattorney-client privilege.\\n\\n      2. The Cross-Appeal, Case No. S23X0901\\n\\n      As part of the investigation into the murders, law enforcement\\n\\nofficers completed two search warrants for Ledbetter’s cell phone\\n\\n\\n\\ndidn’t take derivative the way . . . I thought it was indirect or direct. And by\\nthat I meant, OK, we’ll exclude all the statements the trial court is saying. So\\nyou can’t say what appellee said to the lawyer. But you can say that the lawyer\\nturned it over to us. And I thought that’s the indirect evidence. . . . And . . .\\nWilliams says exactly what to do. Omit everything directly and indirectly that\\ncame from the lawyer for the client, and then the prosecution has to figure out\\na way to get it in. And that’s how I look at it.”\\n                                       27\\n records.   A February 2016 search warrant obtained cell phone\\n\\nrecords related to Miller’s murder, and a February 2020 search\\n\\nwarrant obtained cell phone records related to Stinchcomb’s\\n\\nmurder.20 Ledbetter moved to suppress these cell phone records,\\n\\narguing, among other things, that the search warrants were not\\n\\nsupported by probable cause. The trial court held a hearing on the\\n\\nmotion to suppress, during which the search warrant affidavits and\\n\\napplications were admitted into evidence. 21 The trial court then\\n\\n\\n     20  The phone records related to Stinchcomb’s murder were first obtained\\nwith an “Order Releasing Cellular Telephone Records” issued in March 2015.\\nThe State’s attorney explained to the trial court that law enforcement\\ncompleted a search warrant for the same phone records in February 2020 due\\nto the United States Supreme Court’s issuing Carpenter v. United States, 138\\nSCt 2206 (201 LE2d 507) (2018). Ledbetter raised objections to the March 2015\\norder in the trial court and again on appeal, but we need not address those\\nbecause we conclude that Ledbetter’s challenges to the February 2020 warrant\\nfail. Ledbetter does not allege that the March 2015 order supplied any\\ninformation different from the information gathered with the February 2020\\nsearch warrant. Thus, we would still conclude that the trial court properly\\ndenied Ledbetter’s motion to suppress these records even if we conclude that\\nthe March 2015 order was invalid. See, e.g., McKinney v. State, \\n307 Ga. 129\\n,\\n138 (\\n834 SE2d 741\\n) (2019) (explaining that we did not need to decide whether\\nadmitting evidence to prove other purposes under OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) was\\nproper, when we had determined that the evidence was admissible to prove\\nidentity).\\n\\n     21 There is no evidence in the record that the magistrates who granted\\n\\nthe warrants were presented with anything more than the applications and\\n\\n                                     28\\n denied Ledbetter’s motion to suppress, concluding, among other\\n\\nthings, that the search warrants were supported by probable cause.\\n\\nLedbetter appeals this order. As explained more below, we rely on\\n\\nwell-settled precedent applying the Fourth Amendment to the\\n\\nUnited States Constitution to conclude the warrants were supported\\n\\nby probable cause, and we also reject Ledbetter’s other challenges to\\n\\nthe warrants.\\n\\n     A search warrant will issue only based upon an oath or\\n\\naffirmation stating “facts sufficient to show probable cause that a\\n\\ncrime is being committed or has been committed.” OCGA § 17-5-21\\n\\n(a). See U.S. CONST. amend. IV (stating, in pertinent part, that “no\\n\\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath\\n\\nor affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,\\n\\nand the persons or things to be seized”).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\naffidavits in support of the requested warrants, and Ledbetter and the State\\nagreed that the issues presented in Ledbetter’s motion to suppress should be\\ndecided based only on the warrant application and affidavit.             See\\nMesserschmidt v. Millender, \\n565 U.S. 535\\n, 568 (132 SCt 1235, 182 LE2d 47)\\n(2012) (explaining that a court reviewing the validity of a warrant should\\nconsider “only information brought to the magistrate’s attention”).\\n                                    29\\n      An affidavit supporting a search warrant generally “should\\n\\nestablish a connection between the defendant and the property to be\\n\\nsearched and a link between the property and any criminal activity.”\\n\\nUnited States v. Mathis, 767 F3d 1264, 1276 (11th Cir. 2014)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). In determining if a warrant is\\n\\nsupported by probable cause, the magistrate must “make a practical,\\n\\ncommon-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set\\n\\nforth in the affidavit” supporting the warrant “there is a fair\\n\\nprobability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found” in\\n\\nthe place requested to be searched.

Detective\\n\\nLeonpacher completed the affidavit, providing the following\\n\\ninformation under oath. He had been employed by the Atlanta\\n\\nPolice Department since July 2002 and worked in the Homicide\\n\\nUnit. Miller was shot in Atlanta on January 19, 2016. “A tip from\\n\\nthe Cobb County Police Department indicated that . . . Ledbetter\\n\\nadmitted to a third-party that he shot . . .

When Lett came to the hospital, Miller\\n\\ntold her that “he met a man he knows as ‘John B’ or ‘Lil’ John’ to\\n\\npurchase marijuana,” but then “John” “either shorted or provided\\n\\nfake marijuana” and shot Miller when Miller confronted him; “John”\\n\\nthen drove away with Miller’s backpack.\\n\\n      Detective Leonpacher’s affidavit further averred that Scheib,\\n\\nLedbetter’s attorney, met with him and “proffered information on\\n\\nbehalf of his client,” including that Ledbetter met with Miller to sell\\n\\nmarijuana, Miller tried to rob him, and Ledbetter grabbed the gun\\n\\nand “fired two shots at Miller.”       Scheib also “turned over evidence\\n\\nfrom his client that was related to the shooting including the firearm\\n\\nused to shoot the victim and the victim’s light blue Jansport\\n\\nbackpack.”22 Detective Leonpacher then obtained arrest warrants\\n\\n\\n      22  Ledbetter does not argue that law enforcement’s reliance on\\nstatements and physical evidence gathered from Scheib and detailed in the\\naffidavit was improper or is a basis to suppress the cell phone records. We do\\nnot decide this issue, but note that, as explained above in Divisions 1 (c) (ii)\\n\\n                                      32\\n for Ledbetter for murder and other crimes, and Ledbetter turned\\n\\nhimself in.\\n\\n      In light of this information, the application said the following:\\n\\n      It is now requested that a Search Warrant be issued by\\n      the Magistrate Court of Fulton County to compel the\\n      wireless phone service provider of:\\n\\n         • John Ledbetter (accused)\\n         • Jeremy Miller (victim)\\n         • Shera Lett (dying declaration witness)\\n\\n      which is T-Mobile/MetroPCS, to produce the call detail\\n      records (CDR) associated with those numbers. The\\n      records are material, relevant, and evidence in the\\n      ongoing criminal investigation into the crime of Murder,\\n      which is in violation of OCGA § 16-5-1.\\n\\n      CDR’s, including the cell towers utilized during each call,\\n      can be used to aid in approximating the area from which\\n      calls were made and received and it is believed that the\\n      CDR’s for these three will illustrate that:\\n\\n         • John Ledbetter communicated with the victim prior\\n           to their meeting during which Ledbetter shot the\\n           victim AND that his phone showed activity on cell\\n           towers in the same general geographic area as the\\n           crime scene at/about the time of the shooting.\\n\\n\\nand (iii), the trial court’s order granting Ledbetter’s motion to suppress\\ninformation given to Detective Leonpacher by Scheib in violation of Ledbetter’s\\nattorney-client privilege does not also have the effect of suppressing physical\\nor derivative evidence.\\n                                      33\\n         • Jeremy Miller communicated with Ledbetter prior\\n          to the meeting/shooting.\\n        • Shera Lett received a call from Grady Hospital prior\\n          to hearing the dying declaration from Miller.\\n\\n     The next paragraph listed the information requested, including\\n\\nsubscriber information and call detail records, for:\\n\\n     the MetroPCS/T-Mobile wireless telephone numbers of:\\n     504-223-4160\\n     470-259-8589\\n     404-671-5486\\n\\nThese are the only phone numbers, other than 911, mentioned in the\\n\\nwarrant affidavit and application. The affidavit and application\\n\\nwere presented in the magistrate court of Fulton County and were\\n\\nsigned by a judge.\\n\\n     (i) Ledbetter argues that the warrant was not supported by\\n\\nprobable cause because the affidavit and application failed to\\n\\nconnect any of the target numbers to criminal activity or to\\n\\nLedbetter.   Thus, we must determine whether, “given all the\\n\\ncircumstances set forth in the affidavit,” the magistrate had a\\n\\n“substantial basis” for concluding that there was a fair probability\\n\\nthat evidence of the murder would be found in the records of the\\n\\n                                 34\\n three phone numbers listed in the warrant. Perez, 316 Ga. at 440.\\n\\nWe conduct this inquiry keeping in mind that the magistrate may\\n\\ndraw “reasonable inferences” from the affidavit, Gates, \\n462 U.S. at\\n\\n236\\n, and that the magistrate’s decision is entitled to “substantial\\n\\ndeference,” Perez, 316 Ga. at 440.\\n\\n       Here, we have no trouble concluding that the affidavit offered\\n\\na substantial basis for the magistrate to conclude that there was a\\n\\nfair probability that evidence of Miller’s murder would be found on\\n\\nLedbetter’s cell phone. According to the affidavit, Miller said that\\n\\nhe met someone named “John” to buy marijuana, and that John shot\\n\\nhim.    Further, Ledbetter told someone that he shot Miller, and\\n\\nScheib, Ledbetter’s attorney, said that Ledbetter met Miller to sell\\n\\nmarijuana and fired shots at Miller at this meeting. The affidavit\\n\\nthen said that the requested phone records were expected to show\\n\\nthat Ledbetter “communicated with the victim prior to their\\n\\nmeeting” and was around the crime scene at the time of the shooting.\\n\\nThese circumstances support the common-sense inference that\\n\\nLedbetter used his phone to contact Miller to set up the meeting to\\n\\n                                  35\\n sell Miller drugs, and at that meeting, Ledbetter shot Miller. See\\n\\nUnited States v. Eggerson, 999 F3d 1121, 1127 (8th Cir. 2021)\\n\\n(concluding that “it was not unreasonable for [the state magistrate]\\n\\nto infer that cell phones were being used in connection with the\\n\\nalleged drug dealing”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     We further conclude that, although the affidavit and\\n\\napplication did not state expressly that one of the three numbers for\\n\\nwhich records were sought was Ledbetter’s phone number, the\\n\\nmagistrate could reasonably infer from the affidavit that one of the\\n\\ntarget numbers belonged to Ledbetter. See Taylor v. State, \\n303 Ga.\\n\\n57\\n, 61 (\\n810 SE2d 113\\n) (2018) (rejecting Taylor’s argument that the\\n\\nwarrant was not supported by probable cause because it failed to\\n\\nstate expressly that the address to be searched (1751 Bergen Court)\\n\\nwas Taylor’s address; in light of the other information contained in\\n\\nthe affidavit, “the magistrate, making a practical and common-sense\\n\\ndecision, was entitled to infer that there was a ‘fair probability’ that\\n\\nTaylor lived at 1751 Bergen Court”); United States v. Hunter, 86 F3d\\n\\n679, 681 (7th Cir. 1996) (“The affidavit’s failure to state explicitly\\n\\n                                  36\\n that Palace Court was Hunter’s residence, by itself, is not a fatal\\n\\nflaw.”).\\n\\n     In particular, the affidavit and application indicated that law\\n\\nenforcement had opportunities to learn Ledbetter’s phone number\\n\\nby noting that Scheib “proffered information on behalf of his client”\\n\\nto Detective Leonpacher and that Ledbetter turned himself in for\\n\\narrest. The warrant application then asked the court “to compel the\\n\\nwireless phone service provider of,” listed three people—Ledbetter,\\n\\nMiller, and Lett—in separate bullet points, and said their phone\\n\\nservice provider was T-Mobile/MetroPCS. The warrant application\\n\\nused a similar sequence and format in the next paragraph when\\n\\nexplaining what was expected to be found in the phone records of\\n\\n“these three.” Again, a bulleted list was used, with one bullet point\\n\\ncorresponding to each person listed above:\\n\\n           • John Ledbetter communicated with the victim\\n             [Miller] prior to their meeting during which\\n             Ledbetter shot the victim AND that his phone\\n             showed activity on cell towers in the same general\\n             geographic area as the crime scene at/about the time\\n             of the shooting.\\n\\n\\n                                   37\\n         • Jeremy Miller communicated with Ledbetter prior\\n          to the meeting/shooting.\\n        • Shera Lett received a call from Grady Hospital prior\\n          to hearing the dying declaration from Miller.\\n\\nImportantly, each bullet point listed information that would likely\\n\\nbe found on a particular person’s phone. For example, Ledbetter’s\\n\\ncommunication with Miller would be expected to be found on\\n\\nLedbetter’s phone, just as Miller’s communication with Ledbetter\\n\\nwould be expected to be found on Miller’s phone. Additionally, the\\n\\nfirst bullet point expressly referred to “his phone” in explaining the\\n\\nexpectation that the requested record would show that Ledbetter’s\\n\\nphone was in the area of the shooting around the time of the\\n\\nshooting.   That is not surprising, given that the location of\\n\\nLedbetter’s phone is something one would expect to find in the\\n\\nrecords of Ledbetter’s phone number.\\n\\n     Finally, the application listed the three “Metro PCS/T-Mobile\\n\\nwireless telephone numbers” to be searched:\\n\\n     504-223-4160\\n     470-259-8589\\n     404-671-5486\\n\\n\\n                                 38\\n This format mirrors the two earlier bulleted paragraphs that listed\\n\\nthree separate people (Ledbetter, Miller, and Lett, each time listed\\n\\nin that order), and in this way the format of this request ties the\\n\\nthree listed phone numbers (the only non-emergency phone\\n\\nnumbers mentioned in the warrant) to the three listed people (who\\n\\nwere in two separate places listed in the same order) and with the\\n\\nsets of information law enforcement expected to find associated with\\n\\nthose three listed people. There was nothing in the affidavit and\\n\\napplication to lead the magistrate to believe that the three phone\\n\\nnumbers were associated with people other than the three listed\\n\\npeople, or that law enforcement was mistaken as to which numbers\\n\\nbelonged to the three people.\\n\\n     In light of “all the circumstances” presented here, the\\n\\nmagistrate could have reasonably inferred that the three target\\n\\nphone numbers belonged to the three listed individuals, meaning—\\n\\nas relevant to this case—one of those numbers belonged to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                39\\n Ledbetter.23    See Taylor, 303 Ga. at 61 (concluding that “the\\n\\nmagistrate could easily have inferred a connection between Taylor\\n\\nand the residence at 1751 Bergen Court” in light of “all the\\n\\ncircumstances,” including that the affidavit and its attachment\\n\\ndescribed the location to be searched “as the residence located at\\n\\n1751 Bergen Court,” described the crimes “as occurring at ‘Taylor’s\\n\\nresidence,’” asserted that “‘there is probable cause to believe that a\\n\\ncrime has been committed . . . at said location,” and requested the\\n\\nwarrant to gather evidence from “the crime scene”) (emphasis in\\n\\noriginal); Hunter, 86 F3d at 681 (“Attachment A to the search\\n\\nwarrant and affidavit described the place to be searched as ‘[t]he\\n\\nresidence at 510 Palace Court, Schaumburg, Illinois. . . .’             The\\n\\naffidavit referred four times to Hunter’s residence; it made no\\n\\nreference to any other place connected to Hunter. Although Hunter\\n\\n\\n\\n     23   Ledbetter does not argue that the warrant was not supported by\\nprobable cause because it cannot be determined which of the three target\\nnumbers belonged to him; he argues only that the warrant did not tie him to\\nany of the target numbers. We note, however, that given the way the\\ninformation was presented—with Ledbetter coming first in the earlier two sets\\nof bullet points—the magistrate could have reasonably inferred that the first\\nphone number in the final list belonged to him.\\n                                     40\\n correctly notes that the affidavit did not explicitly state that 510\\n\\nPalace Court was his residence, that is the only logical conclusion\\n\\nsupported by a common-sense reading of the affidavit.”).\\n\\n      Therefore, “the magistrate, making a practical and common-\\n\\nsense decision, was entitled to infer that there was a ‘fair\\n\\nprobability’” that one of the target phone numbers belonged to\\n\\nLedbetter and that evidence of the alleged murder would be found\\n\\nin the phone number’s records. Taylor, 303 Ga. at 61. Of course,\\n\\nLedbetter’s argument on this point would have been more easily\\n\\nresolved if the drafter of the warrant had taken the small, but\\n\\nimportant, extra step of expressly linking the three listed people\\n\\nwith the three listed phone numbers. 24               But given all of the\\n\\n\\n\\n      24 We encourage law enforcement to provide such information on the face\\n\\nof the warrant application or affidavit to alleviate any doubt that those aspects\\nof the warrant comply with the United States Constitution and applicable\\nGeorgia law. And we emphasize that this case should not be read as a holding\\nthat an inference connecting a target phone number with a name listed in a\\nwarrant will always be possible or will always support probable cause,\\nparticularly when a warrant references multiple phone numbers and multiple\\npeople. See Taylor, 303 Ga. at 60 (declining to adopt the “broad rule” that when\\nan affidavit describes one place connected to a suspect and lists a specific\\naddress to be searched, a connection between the address and the suspect will\\n\\n                                       41\\n circumstances, and especially in light of the “substantial deference”\\n\\nwe owe the magistrate’s determination of probable cause, we\\n\\nconclude that “the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding\\n\\nthat probable cause existed to issue the search warrant.” Perez, 316\\n\\nGa. at 440. 25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nalways be inferred as “the only logical conclusion supported by a common-sense\\nreading of the affidavit”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      25 The specially concurring opinion argues that this Court should forgo\\n\\nconsidering whether this warrant was supported by probable cause, overrule\\nGary v. State, \\n262 Ga. 573\\n (\\n422 SE2d 426\\n) (1992), and apply a good-faith\\nexception to affirm the trial court’s denial of Ledbetter’s motion to suppress the\\ncell phone records. We disagree. The specially concurring opinion contends\\nthat we did something similar in Woodard v. State, \\n296 Ga. 803\\n (\\n771 SE2d 362\\n)\\n(2015), where we overruled Heard v. State, \\n261 Ga. 262\\n (\\n402 SE2d 438\\n) (1991),\\nthereby clarifying that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient, rather\\nthan attempting to distinguish Heard or resolve the ineffective-assistance-of-\\ncounsel claim on the prejudice prong. See Woodard, \\n296 Ga. at 810, 814\\n (3) (b)\\n& n.5. But Woodard explained that, under the circumstances of the case, it\\nwas “particularly appropriate” for us to “address whether there was error\\nunder Heard, which involve[d] deciding whether Heard [was] good law.” \\nId. at\\n810\\n (3) (b) n.5. This was because, as we explained, it would have been a stretch\\n“to distinguish th[e] case from Heard,” and whether the appellant suffered\\nprejudice from the alleged deficient performance was a “very close” call. \\nId. at\\n810, 814\\n (3) (b) & n.5. Here, by contrast, we can readily resolve the case by\\napplying existing precedent. And because the application of this existing\\nprecedent clearly shows that the warrants in this case were supported by\\nprobable cause, Ledbetter’s challenges to the warrants fail, and we need not\\nconsider whether to overrule Gary to make a good-faith exception available for\\nwarrants that are not supported by probable cause.\\n\\n                                       42\\n      (ii) Ledbetter next argues that the warrant is invalid under\\n\\nOCGA § 16-11-66.1 (c), which allows the “state-wide application or\\n\\napplication as provided by the laws of the United States” of search\\n\\nwarrants for production of certain communications and records\\n\\n“when issued by a judge with jurisdiction over the criminal offense\\n\\nunder investigation and to which such records relate.” Ledbetter\\n\\npoints out that this search warrant was signed by a magistrate\\n\\njudge, the alleged offense is murder, and magistrate judges do not\\n\\nhave jurisdiction over murder trials. Ledbetter did not, however,\\n\\nraise this argument in his motion to suppress, and instead raises it\\n\\nfor the first time in this pretrial appeal. Because it was not raised\\n\\nbefore the trial court, it was not ruled on in the trial court’s order\\n\\ndenying Ledbetter’s motion to suppress that is the subject of this\\n\\nappeal. We decline to decide this issue in the first instance. See\\n\\nMiddleton v. State, \\n316 Ga. 808\\n, 810 n.3 (\\n890 SE2d 713\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(declining to consider an argument that was “never raised in\\n\\nproceedings below” and was raised for the first time in a pretrial\\n\\nappeal of a motion to suppress).\\n\\n                                   43\\n       (b) February 2020 Search Warrant Related to Stinchcomb’s\\n      Murder26\\n\\n      The February 2020 search warrant sought subscriber\\n\\ninformation, call detail logs, cell tower locations, and other\\n\\ninformation for the phone number 504-402-6292 (the only non-\\n\\nemergency phone number mentioned in the warrant) from February\\n\\n1 through February 28, 2015, to search for evidence related to felony\\n\\nmurder and attempt to sell marijuana.               The warrant requested\\n\\ninformation “within the custody and control of Verizon Wireless at\\n\\n\\n      26 The State argues that Ledbetter has not preserved for our review any\\n\\nof his challenges to the February 2020 search warrant because he did not raise\\nthem in a “written motion” in the trial court. See OCGA § 17-5-30 (b) (requiring\\nmotions to suppress illegally seized evidence to “be in writing and state facts\\nshowing that the search and seizure were unlawful”). However, Ledbetter did\\nraise these challenges in writing. Although they were filed in what was titled\\na “post-hearing brief,” rather than an express amendment to his motion to\\nsuppress, the State raised no objection in the trial court to Ledbetter’s\\napparent use of this brief to amend his motion, and although the trial court did\\nnot expressly address each challenge in its order denying Ledbetter’s motion\\nto suppress, it clearly ruled that the February 2020 warrant was supported by\\nprobable cause and thus (at least implicitly) addressed Ledbetter’s challenges\\nto that warrant. See Cowart v. State, \\n294 Ga. 333\\n, 338 (\\n751 SE2d 399\\n) (2013)\\n(explaining that “[a] brief normally does not amend a motion for new trial to\\nadd new grounds,” but the trial court may “in its discretion” allow the motion\\nto be amended “by treating an enumeration of error raised only in the brief as\\nif it had been raised in the motion”). In any event, we need not decide this\\nquestion definitively, because these challenges all fail for the reasons discussed\\nbelow.\\n\\n                                       44\\n 180 Washington Valley Road, Bedminster, NJ 07291,” for the target\\n\\nphone number, which was described as a “Sprint wireless telephone\\n\\nnumber(s).” The warrant, signed by a Fulton County superior court\\n\\njudge, 27 said that an affidavit was “made before me by Investigator\\n\\nBernice Higgins, an officer charged with the duty of enforcing the\\n\\nCriminal Laws.”        The affidavit was completed under oath by\\n\\nInvestigator Higgins and was based on information she received\\n\\n“from reports provided by the Atlanta Police Department.”\\n\\n     In the affidavit, Investigator Higgins averred the following.\\n\\nStinchcomb was shot in Atlanta on February 13, 2015.                      After\\n\\nStinchcomb     was     shot,    “law     enforcement       officers   received\\n\\ninformation” that Ledbetter and Jayvias Lott were involved in a\\n\\ndrug deal. Ledbetter explained that a man to whom he normally\\n\\nsells marijuana “connected him to a new buyer named ‘Scotty.’”\\n\\nLedbetter further “explained that ‘Scotty’ and LEDBETTER began\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     27 In the legal analysis that follows, we will refer to the judge who signed\\n\\nthe warrant as a “magistrate,” both because much of our law uses that term\\nwhen discussing the issuance of warrants, and to distinguish the judge who\\nsigned the warrant from the judge who denied Ledbetter’s motion to suppress.\\n                                       45\\n exchanging phone calls” and eventually set up a meeting for the sale\\n\\nof marijuana. During this drug transaction, Stinchcomb attempted\\n\\nto rob the men, and Lott shot Stinchcomb. The next paragraph\\n\\nfurther explained:\\n\\n          Over the course of the investigation, specifically\\n     when speaking with JOHN LEDBETTER, it was\\n     determined that LEDBETTER communicated with\\n     JAYVIAS LOTT, AKA “Scotty,” before and after the\\n     homicide via cellphone. Furthermore, it was through this\\n     communication that LEDBETTER and the two potential\\n     purchasers facilitated this attempted purchase of\\n     multiple pounds of marijuana.\\n          The evidence we expect to obtain from the cell phone\\n     dump includes but not limited to: corroborate JOHN\\n     LEDBETTER’S version of events, and to identify other\\n     dates and times JOHN LEDBETTER would have been in\\n     communication with other involved parties.\\n\\n     (i) Similar to his complaint about the February 2016 search\\n\\nwarrant related to Miller’s shooting, Ledbetter argues that this\\n\\nsearch warrant was not supported by probable cause because it\\n\\nfailed to connect the target phone number to the alleged crimes or\\n\\nLedbetter.   Thus, we again consider whether, “given all the\\n\\ncircumstances set forth in the affidavit,” the magistrate had a\\n\\n“substantial basis” for concluding that there was a fair probability\\n\\n                                46\\n that evidence of the murder would be found in the records of this\\n\\nphone number. Perez, 316 Ga. at 440.\\n\\n     Information in the affidavit and application provided the\\n\\nmagistrate a substantial basis for concluding that Ledbetter’s phone\\n\\ncontained evidence of the charged crimes. According to the affidavit,\\n\\nLedbetter said that he and Lott “began exchanging phone calls” and\\n\\neventually set up a drug transaction. At this meeting, Stinchcomb\\n\\nattempted to rob the men, and Lott shot Stinchcomb in the head.\\n\\nThis information supports the common-sense inference that\\n\\nevidence related to the attempted drug sale and shooting could be\\n\\nlocated on Ledbetter’s phone. See Eggerson, 999 F3d at 1127.\\n\\n     Although the February 2020 warrant does not expressly state\\n\\nthat the target number was Ledbetter’s phone number, there was\\n\\nsufficient information in the affidavit to allow the magistrate to infer\\n\\nthat the number belonged to Ledbetter. Specifically, the application\\n\\nfirst listed the target phone number (the only non-emergency phone\\n\\nnumber mentioned).        Then the affidavit said that Ledbetter\\n\\n“explained that [Lott] and LEDBETTER began exchanging phone\\n\\n                                  47\\n calls” and set up the meeting where the shooting then took place,\\n\\nshowing that law enforcement was interested in Ledbetter’s phone\\n\\nuse and had an opportunity to learn Ledbetter’s phone number when\\n\\ntalking to Ledbetter about his phone calls. The next paragraph then\\n\\nreferenced this information provided by Ledbetter in summarizing\\n\\nwhat law enforcement learned from speaking with Ledbetter (that\\n\\nLedbetter talked to Lott “before and after the homicide via\\n\\ncellphone” and set up the drug deal) before explaining what law\\n\\nenforcement “expected[ed] to obtain from the cell phone dump.” The\\n\\nanticipated information was information one would expect to find on\\n\\nLedbetter’s phone, including information that could “corroborate\\n\\nJOHN LEDBETTER’S version of the evidence” and “identify other\\n\\ndates and times JOHN LEDBETTER would have been in\\n\\ncommunication with other involved parties.”\\n\\n     That the affidavit explained that Ledbetter described to law\\n\\nenforcement his cell phone use around the time of the shooting and\\n\\nthen said that law enforcement expected that “the cell phone dump”\\n\\nrequested   would   corroborate    Ledbetter’s   story   and   reveal\\n\\n                                  48\\n Ledbetter’s additional contacts further supports the reasonable\\n\\ninference that the target number belonged to Ledbetter. See Taylor,\\n\\n303 Ga. at 61 (“[W]hen the attachment says that evidence of the\\n\\nalleged crimes may be found at “said location,” which was\\n\\nparticularly described as 1751 Bergen Court, and describes Taylor’s\\n\\nhouse as the crime scene, we think that the magistrate could have\\n\\nreasonably inferred the “crime scene” was 1751 Bergen Court.”);\\n\\nHunter, 86 F3d at 681.\\n\\n     Thus, in light of all of the information provided to the\\n\\nmagistrate, and again keeping in mind the substantial deference we\\n\\nowe to the magistrate’s determination, we conclude that “the\\n\\nmagistrate, making a practical and common-sense decision, was\\n\\nentitled to infer that there was a ‘fair probability’” that the target\\n\\nphone number belonged to Ledbetter and that evidence of the\\n\\nalleged murder would be found in the number’s phone records.\\n\\nTaylor, 303 Ga. at 61.\\n\\n     (ii) Ledbetter next argues that the warrant and affidavit failed\\n\\nto establish probable cause because the target number is identified\\n\\n                                 49\\n as a “Sprint Wireless Telephone Number” but the records to be\\n\\nsearched are alleged to be “located within the control of Verizon\\n\\nWireless.” However, this mismatch of cell phone providers is an\\n\\nexample of a “technical irregularity,” and “[n]o search warrant shall\\n\\nbe quashed or evidence suppressed because of a technical\\n\\nirregularity not affecting the substantial rights of the accused.”\\n\\nOCGA § 17-5-31. See also Dent v.

It is the\\n\\nduty of the magistrate in determining if the warrant is supported by\\n\\nprobable cause to consider “the veracity and basis of knowledge of\\n\\npersons supplying hearsay information.” Britton, 316 Ga. at 286\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).

Magistrates may generally presume that “local law\\n\\nenforcement officials participating in common investigation are\\n\\nreliable informants and their information may be relied on to\\n\\nestablish probable cause for the issuance of search warrants.”\\n\\nPollard v. State, \\n236 Ga. 587\\n, 589 (\\n224 SE2d 420\\n) (1976).

State, \\n310 Ga. 209\\n, 222 (\\n850 SE2d 90\\n) (2020) (“Staleness as [it]\\nrelates to probable cause is measured by the probability that the thing to be\\nseized is located at the place to be searched.”) (citation and punctuation\\nomitted).\\n                                      52\\n      A search warrant may be issued only upon the application\\n     of an officer of this state or its political subdivisions\\n     charged with the duty of enforcing the criminal laws or a\\n     currently certified peace officer engaged in the course of\\n     official duty, whether said officer is employed by a law\\n     enforcement unit of:\\n     (1) The state or a political subdivision of the state; or\\n     (2) A university, college, or school.\\n\\nAlthough the affidavit clearly identifies Investigator Higgins as “an\\n\\nofficer charged with the duty of enforcing the Criminal Law,”\\n\\nLedbetter argues that the warrant was required to identify her as\\n\\nan “officer of this state.” However, there was no reason for the\\n\\nmagistrate to believe that Investigator Higgins, who swore out this\\n\\naffidavit “before” this magistrate in this state about a shooting that\\n\\nhappened in this state, was not an officer of this state. Ledbetter’s\\n\\n“hypertechnical argument” in this regard fails.

I write separately to note my\\n\\nagreement with the concerns raised in Presiding Justice Peterson’s\\n\\nspecial concurrence regarding the confused state of our decisional\\n\\nlaw brought on by our decision in Gary v. State, \\n262 Ga. 573\\n (\\n422\\n\\nSE2d 426\\n) (1992). Like the Presiding Justice, I recognize Gary’s\\n\\nimperiled and untenable position in our law. While the majority\\n\\nopinion demonstrates that we need not overrule Gary to decide the\\n\\ncase at hand, the “mess” the Presiding Justice describes is due to be\\n\\ncleaned up.\\n\\n     I am authorized to state that Justice Warren, Justice\\n\\nMcMillian, and Justice Pinson join in this concurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  55\\n      PETERSON, Presiding Justice, concurring specially.\\n\\n     Over 30 years ago, this Court invented a new version of the\\n\\nexclusionary rule — a version that excluded more evidence than the\\n\\nfederal version. See Gary v. State, \\n262 Ga. 573\\n (\\n422 SE2d 426\\n) (1992)\\n\\n(holding that OCGA § 17-5-30 created a Georgia statutory\\n\\nexclusionary rule that did not contain the good faith exception to the\\n\\nfederal exclusionary rule recognized in United States v. Leon, \\n468\\n\\nU.S. 897\\n (104 SCt 3405, 82 LE2d 677) (1984)). Several years ago, we\\n\\nemphatically determined that Gary was wrongly decided. See\\n\\nMobley v. State, \\n307 Ga. 59\\n, 72-75 (4) (a) (\\n834 SE2d 785\\n) (2019). But\\n\\nwe could not overrule Gary’s holding prohibiting Georgia courts from\\n\\napplying Leon, however, because Mobley did not involve a claim to\\n\\nwhich Leon could apply. See id. at 76 (4) (a) n.21.\\n\\n     Now, after more than three decades of Georgia courts excluding\\n\\nevidence due only to our misbegotten invention in Gary, such a case\\n\\nsquarely presents itself. But instead of finishing the job we started\\n\\nin Mobley (and have taken further in other contexts since then), the\\n\\nmajority chooses to leave Gary’s holding — now admittedly wrong\\n\\n                                  56\\n and based on reasoning no longer followed in any other respect —\\n\\nbinding on all Georgia courts. I cannot and do not agree with that\\n\\ndecision, and so I do not join Divisions (2) (a) (i) and (2) (b) (i). But\\n\\nbecause I would overrule whatever vestiges of Gary still remain and\\n\\napply Leon’s good faith exception, I concur in the judgment of those\\n\\ndivisions. I join the remainder of the decision of the Court in full.\\n\\n     The officers who searched the defendant’s phone did so in good\\n\\nfaith reliance on the search warrant. Under federal law, this renders\\n\\nthe exclusionary rule inapplicable even if the warrant was not\\n\\nsupported by probable cause. See Leon, \\n468 U.S. at 919-920\\n (III) (B).\\n\\nBut we held over 30 years ago that OCGA § 17-5-30 requires\\n\\nexclusion of all evidence seized with a warrant unsupported by\\n\\nprobable cause, regardless of whether a federal good faith exception\\n\\nmight have applied. See Gary, \\n262 Ga. at 574-575\\n. Subsection (a) of\\n\\nthat statute provides as follows:\\n\\n           A defendant aggrieved by an unlawful search and\\n     seizure may move the court for the return of property, the\\n     possession of which is not otherwise unlawful, and to\\n     suppress as evidence anything so obtained on the grounds\\n     that:\\n\\n                                    57\\n            (1) The search and seizure without a warrant was\\n     illegal; or\\n           (2) The search and seizure with a warrant was\\n     illegal because the warrant is insufficient on its face,\\n     there was not probable cause for the issuance of the\\n     warrant, or the warrant was illegally executed.\\n\\nOCGA § 17-5-30 (a). And subsection (b) provides in relevant part\\n\\nthat “[i]f the motion is granted the property shall be restored, unless\\n\\notherwise subject to lawful detention, and it shall not be admissible\\n\\nin evidence against the movant in any trial.”\\n\\n     In Gary, this Court interpreted OCGA § 17-5-30 as an\\n\\n“unequivocal expression of [the Legislature’s] desire that evidence\\n\\nseized by means of a warrant that is not supported by probable cause\\n\\nbe suppressed.” Gary, \\n262 Ga. at 575\\n. This interpretation rejected\\n\\nthe possibility of exceptions to the exclusionary rule and, in doing\\n\\nso, rejected the good faith exception, which would otherwise permit\\n\\nthe introduction of evidence that officers obtained by acting in\\n\\nreasonable reliance on a warrant issued by a neutral and detached\\n\\nmagistrate but that ultimately lacked probable cause. See \\nid. at 574\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  58\\n      This reasoning, of course, did not turn on anything specific to\\n\\nwarrants lacking probable cause. The structure of the statute\\n\\napplies the statute’s provisions equally to each of the four\\n\\nenumerated ways in which a search and seizure may have been\\n\\nunlawful: (1) it was done illegally without a warrant, (2) it was done\\n\\nillegally with a warrant because the warrant was insufficient on its\\n\\nface, (3) it was done illegally with a warrant because the warrant\\n\\nwas unsupported by probable cause, and (4) it was done illegally\\n\\nwith a warrant because the warrant was illegally executed. See\\n\\nOCGA § 17-5-30 (a). Under Gary’s reasoning, if any of these four\\n\\nenumerated bases of unlawfulness is present, the evidence must be\\n\\nexcluded.\\n\\n     Twenty-seven years later, we repudiated Gary’s interpretation\\n\\nof the statute. In Mobley, we “disavow[ed] the unsound reasoning of\\n\\nGary,” limited its application only to the Leon good faith exception\\n\\nat issue there, and concluded that OCGA § 17-5-30 meant “what it\\n\\nmost naturally and reasonably is understood in context to mean —\\n\\nit establishes a procedure for applying the exclusionary rule but does\\n\\n                                 59\\n not itself require the suppression of any evidence.” 307 Ga. at 75 (4)\\n\\n(a). But we could not reach the question of overruling the Leon\\n\\nholding, because the facts of Mobley would not warrant application\\n\\nof Leon, and so we concluded that overruling that holding was “a\\n\\nquestion that [would] have to await a case involving the reliance of\\n\\nan officer in good faith on the validity of a search warrant.” Id. at 76\\n\\n(4) (a) n.21.\\n\\n     Though much of Mobley on this point may have been dicta, we\\n\\nhave since applied its rationale as a holding to admit evidence more\\n\\ntimes than we have ever applied Gary to suppress evidence. See\\n\\nOutlaw v. State, \\n311 Ga. 396\\n, 400 (2) (b) n.4 (\\n858 SE2d 63\\n) (2021)\\n\\n(applying Mobley to hold that Gary did not foreclose the application\\n\\nof two other kinds of good faith exception when evidence was\\n\\nillegally seized without a warrant and to affirm the trial court’s\\n\\ndenial of a motion to suppress evidence); Lofton v. State, \\n310 Ga.\\n\\n770\\n, 782-784 (2) nn.17-18 (\\n854 SE2d 690\\n) (2021) (same), disapproved\\n\\nin part on other grounds by Outlaw, 311 Ga. at 401 (2) (b) n.5;\\n\\nSwinson v. State, \\n311 Ga. 48\\n, 54-55 (2) (a) (\\n855 SE2d 629\\n) (2021)\\n\\n                                  60\\n (applying Lofton to affirm the trial court’s denial of a motion to\\n\\nsuppress evidence), disapproved in part on other grounds by Outlaw,\\n\\n311 Ga. at 401 (2) (b) n.5; Gialenios v.

See Mobley, 307 Ga.\\n\\nat 74 (4) (a) (citing Teal v. State, \\n282 Ga. 319\\n, 325 (2) (\\n647 SE2d 15\\n)\\n\\n(2007) (inevitable discovery exception); Taylor v.

App. 739\\n, 742 (\\n644 SE2d\\n\\n878\\n) (2007) (inevitable discovery exception)).\\n\\n     In other words, the current state of Georgia law is that the\\n\\nstatutory text “[a] defendant aggrieved by an unlawful search and\\n\\nseizure may move the court . . . to suppress as evidence anything so\\n\\nobtained” and “[i]f the motion is granted the . . . [evidence] shall not\\n\\nbe admissible in evidence against the movant in any trial” somehow\\n\\nsingles out the Leon good faith exception to the exclusionary rule —\\n\\nalone among all the other exceptions — as uniquely inapplicable in\\n\\nGeorgia courts. There is no rational way to read those words to mean\\n\\nsomething so strange.\\n\\n     And unless we take the one final step that Mobley could not,\\n\\nthat bizarre result will remain binding on all other Georgia courts.\\n\\nWhatever force stare decisis might have had before we started\\n\\ndisassembling Gary, it has vanishingly little now. And while I have\\n\\n                                  62\\n often urged this Court to adhere to prior holdings as a matter of that\\n\\ndoctrine, the time for that on this issue has come and gone.29\\n\\n      In short: (1) there is no support in the text of OCGA § 17-5-30\\n\\nfor the idea that the statute permits some exceptions to the\\n\\nexclusionary rule but excludes others; (2) the current state of the\\n\\nlaw is a mess of our own making, and we should clean it up; and (3)\\n\\nuntil we do, trial courts will be compelled to exclude evidence that\\n\\nfederal law would admit, and the Court of Appeals will be compelled\\n\\nto affirm that exclusion. And in the face of all of this, the majority\\n\\n\\n\\n      29 The fact that whether the trial court erred in denying the motion to\\n\\nsuppress can be resolved without addressing the Gary issue does not hinder us\\nfrom taking that final step here. Indeed, we did the same thing in Woodard v.\\nState, \\n296 Ga. 803\\n (\\n771 SE2d 362\\n) (2015), where the case could “be resolved\\nwithout reaching [the] issue” of whether Heard v. State, \\n261 Ga. 262\\n (\\n402 SE2d\\n438\\n) (1991) was “good law[.]” Woodard, \\n296 Ga. at 815\\n (1) (Benham, J.,\\nconcurring specially). Today’s majority overlooks the fact that the Woodard\\nmajority had options: (1) it could attempt to resolve the ineffective assistance\\nof counsel claim on the “very close” question of whether the defendant was\\nprejudiced by any deficient performance, \\nid. at 810\\n (3) (b) & n.5; (2) it “could\\nendeavor to distinguish [that] case from Heard[,]” \\nid. at 814\\n (3) (b); or (3) it\\ncould “reconsider and overrule Heard[,]” \\nid. at 811\\n (3) (b). And yet the Woodard\\nmajority held that “[t]he better course [was] simply to overrule Heard [then],\\nbefore it [became] any more entrenched” and overruled Heard. \\nId. at 814\\n (3)\\n(b). The use of “the better course” itself implies the existence of multiple\\ncourses the Court could have taken. Further, similar to the special concurrence\\nin Woodard, the majority makes no attempt to justify keeping in place the mess\\nthat we created in Gary.\\n                                      63\\n offers no explanation whatsoever for its decision to require all other\\n\\nGeorgia courts to continue applying Gary. I would overrule whatever\\n\\ntraces remain of Gary and affirm the trial court’s denial of his\\n\\nmotion to suppress under the Leon good faith exception to the\\n\\nexclusionary rule.\\n\\n     I am authorized to state that Chief Justice Boggs and Justice\\n\\nLaGrua join in this concurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   64\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9481015/state-v-ledbetter-and-vice-versa/'}),\n",

On December 21, 2018, the Insurer wired $3,093,085.50\\n\\nto Davis’s IOLTA account.\\n\\n     On December 31, 2018, the Insurer was informed that its\\n\\nemails with the policyholder had been compromised and that the\\n\\nfunds at issue were never received by the policyholder. The Insurer\\n\\nreported the incident to Citibank and the FBI, and on January 3,\\n\\n2019, counsel for the Insurer sent a “cease and desist” letter to Davis\\n\\ndemanding return of the funds.        The Insurer was subsequently\\n\\nnotified that Wells Fargo credited $2,540,319.30 from Davis’s\\n\\nIOLTA account to the Insurer, which left $552,755.20 unaccounted\\n\\nfor by Davis.    Additionally, the payment from Davis’s IOLTA\\n\\naccount to the Insurer included $3,500.00 belonging to clients of\\n\\n                                  3\\n Davis, of which Davis was aware.\\n\\n      Davis initially denied any knowledge of or participation in the\\n\\nmisappropriation of these funds and claimed that he was also a\\n\\nvictim in this scheme. However, the factual allegations of the Notice\\n\\nof Discipline—which Davis has admitted by virtue of his default—\\n\\nstate that Davis was “a knowing and intentional participant in the\\n\\ninterception and theft of the [funds]” and “knowingly used his\\n\\nattorney trust account to carry out the interception and theft of the\\n\\n[funds].”5\\n\\n      The State Disciplinary Board’s (the “Board”) memorandum of\\n\\ngrievance, which is also included in the record, demonstrates that\\n\\nthe Board initiated a grievance against Davis based upon\\n\\ninformation suggesting that Davis “may have violated one or more\\n\\nof the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct.” See Bar Rule 4-203\\n\\n(2). Specifically, the Board learned that, on January 14, 2019, the\\n\\nInsurer filed a lawsuit against Davis and numerous “John Does” in\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 The record does not reflect whether Davis was ever charged with any\\n\\ncrimes arising from this conduct.\\n                                     4\\n the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia\\n\\n(the “federal case”), raising claims for conversion, RICO, common\\n\\nlaw fraud, and civil conspiracy, among others.\\n\\n     On June 21, 2019, the district court issued an order in the\\n\\nfederal case addressing several motions filed by the parties,\\n\\nincluding Davis’s motion to dismiss and the Insurer’s motion for a\\n\\npreliminary injunction. The district court granted the Insurer’s\\n\\nrequest for injunctive relief and partly granted Davis’s motion to\\n\\ndismiss, but only as to certain of the Insurer’s claims. In so ruling,\\n\\nthe district court observed that, in litigating the federal case, Davis\\n\\nhad explicitly acknowledged and admitted to the following: (1) “in\\n\\nhis role as an attorney,” Davis “serves as a paymaster” for certain\\n\\nentities, and it was in this role as paymaster that he came to acquire\\n\\nthe funds at issue from the Insurer; (2) “[t]he first transfer of\\n\\n$3,093,085.50 was wired to Mr. Davis’s IOLTA [a]ccount on\\n\\nDecember 21, 2018”; (3) Davis was “informed by Citibank that the\\n\\ntransfer was the result of false wiring instructions”; (4) Wells Fargo\\n\\nreturned funds in the amount of $2,540,319.30 to the Insurer; (5)\\n\\n                                  5\\n “[f]unds in the amount of $552,766.20 were paid out to Mr. Davis as\\n\\nhis fee for services rendered as paymaster for what he believed was\\n\\na legitimate transaction” with the Insurer; (6) Davis “used his fee\\n\\nmonies to pay outstanding bills/debts”; and (7) Davis’s “involvement\\n\\nin the subject transaction was in his role as an attorney with the law\\n\\nfirm J. Davis, Attorney at Law, LLC.” The district court held that\\n\\nDavis’s “version of the facts” set forth above was “a binding judicial\\n\\nadmission.” The record reflects that the Insurer and Davis later\\n\\nsettled the federal case, and the case was administratively closed in\\n\\nOctober 2019.\\n\\n      Having reviewed the record and considered the facts deemed\\n\\nadmitted by Davis’s default, the State Disciplinary Board found\\n\\nprobable cause to believe that Davis violated Rules 1.15 (I), 1.15 (II)\\n\\n(a)6, and 8.4 (a) (4). The maximum sanction for a violation of Rules\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 Based on the underlying facts, it does not appear that Davis violated\\n\\nRule 1.15 (II) (a), which provides that\\n      [e]very lawyer who practices law in Georgia, whether said lawyer\\n      practices as a sole practitioner, or as a member of a firm,\\n      association, or professional corporation, and who receives money\\n      or property on behalf of a client or in any other fiduciary capacity,\\n\\n                                        6\\n 1.15 (I), 1.15 (II) (b), and 8.4 (a) (4) is disbarment.\\n\\n      As    aggravating      factors,    the   Board     considered      Davis’s\\n\\nsubstantial experience in the practice of law and, as a mitigating\\n\\nfactor, his absence of prior disciplinary history. The Board advised\\n\\nthat Standard 4.11 of the American Bar Association’s Annotated\\n\\nStandards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions was applicable to Davis’s\\n\\nviolations of Rules 1.15 (I) and 1.15 (II), which provides that\\n\\ndisbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly\\n\\nconverts client property and causes injury or potential injury to a\\n\\nclient. See ABA Standards for Imposing Sanction 4.11. See also In\\n\\nthe Matter of Morse, 266 Ga. 652, 653 (470 SE2d 232) (1996) (stating\\n\\nthat this Court looks to the ABA Standards for guidance in\\n\\ndetermining      appropriate       disciplinary     sanction).     The    Board\\n\\n\\n\\n      shall maintain or have available one or more trust accounts as\\n      required by these Rules. All funds held by a lawyer for a client and\\n      all funds held by a lawyer in any other fiduciary capacity shall be\\n      deposited in and administered from a trust account.\\nMore likely, Davis violated Rule 1.15 (II) (b), which provides, in pertinent part,\\nthat “[n]o funds shall be withdrawn from such trust accounts for the personal\\nuse of the lawyer maintaining the account except earned lawyer’s fees debited\\nagainst the account of a specific client and recorded as such.” This discrepancy\\nultimately has no bearing on the recommended discipline in this case.\\n                                        7\\n concluded that Davis “knowingly converted the property of his\\n\\nclients when he included client funds from his trust account to make\\n\\npartial reimbursement of the funds at issue.”\\n\\n     The Board further advised that Standard 5.11 (b) of the ABA\\n\\nStandards for Imposing Sanctions was applicable to Davis’s\\n\\nviolation of Rule 8.4 (a) (4), which provides that disbarment is\\n\\ngenerally appropriate when a lawyer engages in intentional conduct\\n\\ninvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that\\n\\nseriously adversely reflects on the lawyer’s fitness to practice. See\\n\\nABA Standards for Imposing Sanction 5.11 (b). See also In the\\n\\nMatter of Morse, 266 Ga. at 653. The Board concluded that\\n\\n“[t]hrough his knowing and intentional participation in the\\n\\ninterception and theft of the [funds at issue], [Davis] engaged in\\n\\nintentional   conduct   involving       dishonest,   fraud,   deceit,   or\\n\\nmisrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on [Davis’s]\\n\\nfitness to practice.”\\n\\n     Having reviewed the record and considered Davis’s factual\\n\\nadmissions herein, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate\\n\\n                                    8\\n sanction in this disciplinary matter and is consistent with similar\\n\\ncases in which an attorney utilized fraud to misappropriate funds\\n\\nand defaulted during the disciplinary process.        See, e.g., In the\\n\\nMatter of Fagan, 314 Ga. 208, 213 (876 SE2d 242) (2022) (disbarring\\n\\nattorney who engaged in professional misconduct involving\\n\\ndishonesty and fraud, misappropriated client funds, and failed to\\n\\nrespond to the formal complaint); In the Matter of Cheatham, 304\\n\\nGa. 645, 646 (820 SE2d 668) (2018) (disbarring attorney who\\n\\nconverted client funds to his own use and failed to respond to\\n\\ndisciplinary authorities); In the Matter of Mathis, 297 Ga. 867, 868\\n\\n(778 SE2d 793) (2015) (disbarring attorney who misappropriated\\n\\nclient funds that had been wired to him in advance of a real estate\\n\\nclosing   and   failed   to   respond   to   disciplinary   authorities).\\n\\nAccordingly, it is hereby ordered that the name of James W.

HARRIS v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      MCFADDEN, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      Edvado Harris appeals from a trial court order denying his motion to suppress\\n\\nevidence obtained from his automobile pursuant to a search warrant. Because the\\n\\naffidavit upon which the warrant was based failed to establish probable cause for the\\n\\nsearch, we reverse the denial of the motion to suppress.\\n\\n      1. Facts and procedural posture\\n\\n      Harris and Darian Barker were involved in a two-car collision resulting in the\\n\\ndeath of a passenger in Harris’ car. A Georgia State Patrol Trooper applied for and\\n\\nobtained search warrants allowing officers to download data from the Electric Control\\n Module (“ECM”) in each vehicle. The ECM data retrieved from Harris’s car showed\\n\\nthat at the time of the collision, his car was traveling approximately 70 miles per hour.\\n\\n      In a single indictment, Harris and Barker were each charged with multiple\\n\\noffenses. Harris was charged with vehicular homicide for causing a death by recklessly\\n\\ndriving 70 miles per hour in a 35 miles per hour zone; reckless driving; speeding; no\\n\\nproof of insurance; failure to wear a safety belt; and driving with a suspended vehicle\\n\\nregistration. Barker was charged with vehicular homicide for a hit and run violation\\n\\nin that he fled from the scene of the deadly collision; vehicular homicide by causing\\n\\na death while driving under the influence of alcohol; hit and run; driving under the\\n\\ninfluence of alcohol; failure to yield the right of way; and driving without a license.\\n\\n      Harris filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained from his vehicle’s ECM,\\n\\narguing that the affidavit on which the warrant was based failed to establish probable\\n\\ncause for the search. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion, but issued a\\n\\ncertificate of immediate review. Harris applied for interlocutory review, we granted\\n\\nthe application, and this appeal followed.\\n\\n      2. Search warrant\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             2\\n       “[A] physical intrusion into a personal motor vehicle for the purpose of\\n\\nobtaining information for a law enforcement investigation generally is a search for\\n\\npurposes of the Fourth Amendment[.]” Mobley v. State, \\n307 Ga. 59\\n, 66 (2) (\\n834 SE2d\\n\\n785\\n) (2019). “The Fourth Amendment evinces a strong preference for searches\\n\\nconducted pursuant to a warrant.” \\nId. at 67\\n (3) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      In Georgia, a search warrant shall only issue upon facts sufficient to show\\n      probable cause that a crime is being committed or has been committed.\\n      OCGA § 17-5-21 (a). The magistrate’s task in determining if probable\\n      cause exists to issue a search warrant is simply to make a practical,\\n      common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in\\n      the affidavit before him, . . . there is a fair probability that contraband or\\n      evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\\n\\nState v. Black, \\n370 Ga. App. 18\\n, 21-22 (1) (\\n893 SE2d 517\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n      In this case, the trooper’s affidavit alleged that an inspection of Harris’s vehicle\\n\\n“would sho[w] any causation factors in this collision” involving a violation of OCGA\\n\\n§ 40-6-393 (b), which prohibits a driver from leaving the scene of an accident which\\n\\ncaused the death of another. The affidavit then claimed that the following facts\\n\\nestablished probable cause that a crime had been committed:\\n\\n      On Saturday, February 10, 2018 at approximately 8:12 P.M., a two\\n      vehicle crash occurred on Southerfield Road at its intersection with\\n\\n                                            3\\n       Mayo Street in Americus. A 2007 Toyota Scion[, Barker’s vehicle,] was\\n      traveling north on Southerfield Road, attempting to make a left turn on\\n      to Mayo Street. A 2009 Cadillac[, Harris’s vehicle,] was traveling south\\n      on Southerfield Road as the Toyota was attempting to make its left turn\\n      on to Mayo Street. The Toyota struck the Cadillac on the left side. The\\n      area of impact was in the southbound lane of Southerfield Road. The\\n      Cadillac traveled to the right and off the north shoulder of Mayo Road\\n      and overturned and struck a utility pole. A back seat passenger in the\\n      Cadillac succumbed to his injuries from the crash. The Toyota traveled\\n      off the south shoulder of Mayo Road and came to a final rest on the south\\n      shoulder of Mayo Road facing south. The driver of the Toyota fled the\\n      scene after the crash.\\n\\n      Based on the affidavit, a magistrate court judge issued the search warrant for\\n\\nHarris’ car, including permission to download data from the car’s ECM. In the search\\n\\nwarrant, the magistrate found that a vehicle inspection would show causation factors\\n\\nfor the collision, cited the alleged violation of OCGA § 40-6-393 (b) for leaving the\\n\\nscene of the accident, and concluded that there was probable cause to believe that a\\n\\ncrime had been committed.\\n\\n      On appeal, we “review the search warrant to determine the existence of\\n\\nprobable cause using the totality of the circumstances analysis. The duty of the\\n\\nappellate court[] is to determine if the magistrate had a ‘substantial basis’ for\\n\\nconcluding that probable cause existed to issue the search warrant.” Black, supra at\\n\\n22 (1) (citation omitted). In making such a determination, “we look at the\\n\\n                                         4\\n circumstances as they existed when the search warrant was issued, and whether the\\n\\ndefendant will be ultimately found to have been engaging in criminal activity is of no\\n\\nconsequence for purposes of our analysis, which is grounded in the safeguards\\n\\nafforded by the Fourth Amendment.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      Here, given the circumstances as they existed when the search warrant was\\n\\nissued, we find that the magistrate did not have a substantial basis for concluding that\\n\\nprobable cause existed to issue the search warrant for Harris’s car. The trooper’s\\n\\naffidavit set forth no facts indicating that Harris had committed a crime or traffic\\n\\noffense. The only facts relating to Harris in the affidavit were that Barker made a left\\n\\nturn and collided with Harris’s Cadillac in the southbound lane in which Harris was\\n\\ntraveling, that the Cadillac was forced off the road and overturned, and that a\\n\\npassenger died in the accident. The only crime referenced in the affidavit was\\n\\nvehicular homicide for leaving the scene of the accident, but the affidavit alleged only\\n\\nthat Barker, not Harris, had fled from the scene. Indeed, at the motion to suppress\\n\\nhearing, the trooper testified that the inspection of Harris’s Cadillac, including\\n\\nretrieval of data from the ECM, was done because Barker had left the scene of the\\n\\naccident.\\n\\n\\n                                           5\\n       We note that at the suppression hearing, the trooper also testified that he had\\n\\nbeen advised that another trooper smelled alcohol on Harris’s person after the\\n\\ncollision. But the trooper did not include any such information in his affidavit and\\n\\nthere is no evidence that the trooper otherwise informed the magistrate of such an\\n\\nallegation. “The (magistrate) may consider oral testimony as well as the affidavit in\\n\\nissuing a search warrant.” Whatley v. State, \\n335 Ga. App. 749\\n, 752 (1) (\\n782 SE2d 831\\n)\\n\\n(2016) (citation and punctuation omitted). Indeed, “[t]he well-established rule\\n\\npermits consideration of evidence concerning oral testimony provided to the\\n\\nmagistrate.” Gibson v. State, \\n223 Ga. App. 103\\n, 104 (2) (\\n476 SE2d 863\\n) (1996).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         6\\n But where, as here, there is no evidence that the magistrate was provided with any oral\\n\\ntestimony about an alleged odor of alcohol, we consider only the information set forth\\n\\nin the affidavit upon which the magistrate’s probable cause finding was made. See\\n\\nBlack, supra (we consider the circumstances as they existed when the search warrant\\n\\nwas issued). Since the trooper’s affidavit on which the search warrant for Harris’s car\\n\\nwas based was “insufficient to support probable cause, . . . the trial court should have\\n\\ngranted [Harris’s] motion to suppress.” Shirley v. State, \\n297 Ga. 722\\n, 725 (\\n777 SE2d\\n\\n444\\n) (2015).\\n\\n      Judgment reversed. Mercier, C.

On December 14,\\n2023, the trial court entered an order denying the motion to vacate. Chaparro\\nsubsequently moved to vacate the trial court’s December 14 order, arguing that he had\\nnot received notice of the same until the deadline for filing an appeal had passed.

WARD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n       HODGES, Judge.\\n\\n       Following a jury trial, Gregory Lamar Ward was convicted as a recidivist of\\n\\nfelony-level family violence battery (OCGA § 16-5-23.1 (a), (f) (2)). The trial court\\n\\ndenied his motion for a new trial, and he filed the instant appeal. In it, he argues that:\\n\\n(1) the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in considering the general grounds\\n\\n(OCGA §§ 5-5-20, 5-5-21); (2) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction;\\n\\n(3) the trial court erred in admitting his 2018 conviction for family violence battery\\n\\nunder OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (“Rule 404 (b)”)); (4) the trial court gave an erroneous\\n\\nRule 404 (b) jury instruction; and (5) the trial court also erred in admitting certain out-\\n of-court statements for impeachment purposes.1 For the reasons that follow, we\\n\\naffirm.\\n\\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,2 the evidence adduced at trial\\n\\nshows that on the night of September 27, 2020, witness Angela Withers heard her\\n\\napartment complex neighbor, Rebecca Simpson, screaming for her sister, who also\\n\\nlived nearby. Withers did not see what was going on because she was indoors, while\\n\\nSimpson was outside. Because Simpson sounded “scared[,]” Withers called 911.\\n\\nOfficer Bobby Elswick with the Dalton Police Department responded to the scene. He\\n\\nfound Simpson in the doorway of her apartment, in the rain, “hysterical” and\\n\\n“crying.” She was holding a bloody, wet rag to her mouth and had visible cuts inside\\n\\nher lips, with visible swelling on the right side.\\n\\n      Elswick testified that, at the scene, Simpson told him Ward “struck her in the\\n\\nface four times.” A witness told the officer that Ward “ran across the street towards\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      1\\n        Morgan County v. Gay, \\n352 Ga. App. 555\\n, 559 (1) (a), n. 4 (\\n834 SE2d 576\\n)\\n(2019) (“For convenience of discussion, we have taken the enumerated errors out of\\nthe order in which appellant has listed them . . . .”) (citation and punctuation\\nomitted).\\n      2\\n          Percell v. State, \\n346 Ga. App. 219\\n (1) (\\n816 SE2d 344\\n) (2018).\\n                                            2\\n a warehouse.” Elswick and another officer found Ward “hiding” in the trailer of a\\n\\nsemi-truck, filled with carpet rolls, that was backed up to a loading dock.\\n\\n      Simpson testified at trial, however, that she accidentally slipped and fell on the\\n\\nrain-slick tiled floor of her entryway and could not get up because she has a bone\\n\\ndisease and a bad knee. She and Ward had been arguing inside her apartment. They\\n\\nhad been in a romantic relationship for about a month and a half. Simpson and Ward\\n\\nwere both “[v]ery” intoxicated, and Simpson was yelling at Ward because he had left\\n\\nher somewhere and she was “jealous” that he had been with another woman. She was\\n\\nattempting to leave and when Ward “grabbed” her to prevent her from going, she\\n\\n“slipped.” When Ward tried to pick her up, she could not raise her knee. She testified\\n\\nthat Ward’s forearm hit her lip, causing her tooth to cut into it, and she crawled\\n\\noutside and walked to her sister’s home. By this time, Ward “had done left.”\\n\\n      At trial, Simpson denied telling the officer that Ward hit her, instead testifying\\n\\nthat she only “said it felt like I had been beat in the face a thousand times” or “felt\\n\\nlike I’d been hit about four or five times.” She then testified, contrary to her earlier\\n\\ntestimony, that she did not tell the officer Ward tried to pick her up, but only that she\\n\\nhad slipped, and Ward’s arm “caught [her] lip[,]” accidentally injuring her. Elswick\\n\\n\\n                                           3\\n testified, by contrast, that Simpson did not tell him it only “fe[lt] like” she was hit in\\n\\nthe face four times. He testified that on the night of the injuries, Simpson said nothing\\n\\nto him about an accidental injury or a slip-and-fall. Elswick did not have a body-cam,\\n\\nso there is no footage of his interaction with Simpson.\\n\\n      At trial, Simpson testified that she was still in touch with Ward, he had\\n\\nexpressed affection for her since the injuries, she loved him and wanted a favorable\\n\\nresult for him in court, and he had apologized to her for what happened on the date\\n\\nshe was injured.\\n\\n      1. Ward’s motion for new trial relied in part upon OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-21,\\n\\ninvoking the trial court’s discretion as the thirteenth juror to set the verdict aside as\\n\\ncontrary to the principles of justice and equity, because of the conflicting testimony\\n\\nfrom Simpson and Elswick regarding whether Simpson’s injuries were the result of\\n\\nan accident or Ward’s intentional actions. On appeal, Ward contends the record\\n\\nshows no evidence that the trial court exercised its discretion in denying his motion\\n\\nfor new trial. We find no error.\\n\\n             Even when the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a\\n      conviction, a trial judge may grant a new trial if the verdict of the jury is\\n      “contrary to . . . the principles of justice and equity,” OCGA § 5–5–20,\\n\\n\\n                                            4\\n        or if the verdict is “decidedly and strongly against the weight of the\\n       evidence.” OCGA § 5–5–21. When properly raised in a timely motion,\\n       these grounds for a new trial — commonly known as the “general\\n       grounds”— require the trial judge to exercise a broad discretion to sit as\\n       a thirteenth juror. In exercising that discretion, the trial judge must\\n       consider some of the things that she cannot when assessing the legal\\n       sufficiency of the evidence, including any conflicts in the evidence, the\\n       credibility of witnesses, and the weight of the evidence. Although the\\n       discretion of a trial judge to award a new trial on the general grounds is\\n       not boundless — it is, after all, a discretion that should be exercised with\\n       caution and invoked only in exceptional cases in which the evidence\\n       preponderates heavily against the verdict — it nevertheless is, generally\\n       speaking, a substantial discretion.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Allen v. State, \\n296 Ga. 738\\n, 740 (2) (\\n770 SE2d\\n\\n625\\n) (2015).\\n\\n\\n\\n       Although Ward argues that the record contains no evidence showing the trial\\n\\ncourt exercised its discretion, this is incorrect. At the hearing on Ward’s motion for\\n\\nnew trial, Ward’s attorney asked the trial court to sit as the thirteenth juror to consider\\n\\nconflicting witness testimony. In its order, the trial court stated that, “[h]aving\\n\\nreviewed the [d]efendant’s [m]otion, the record in this case, and having heard the\\n\\n\\n                                             5\\n arguments of counsel, the [c]ourt hereby DENIES the [d]efendant’s [m]otion for\\n\\n[n]ew [t]rial.” The trial court’s order in Allen, supra, was remarkably similar. It said:\\n\\n“After considering the record in this case, the Defendant’s amended motions for new\\n\\ntrial, the State’s response in opposition at the hearing in this case, and the arguments\\n\\nby both the defendant and State on the issues contained therein, the Defendant’s\\n\\nmotion for new trial is hereby DENIED.” \\n296 Ga. at 740-741\\n (2). In assessing this\\n\\norder, the Supreme Court found:\\n\\n      Nothing in this order indicates that the trial court failed to perform its\\n      duty to exercise its discretion and weigh the evidence in its consideration\\n      of the general grounds. The court did not state the incorrect standard in\\n      its order, and nothing in the record indicates that the court was unaware\\n      of its responsibility.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Allen, \\n296 Ga. at 741\\n (1); accord Drennon v.\\n\\nState, \\n314 Ga. 854\\n, 860 (2) (\\n880 SE2d 139\\n) (2022) (explaining that when a trial court\\n\\nevaluates the general grounds as the “thirteenth juror,” we presume that the court\\n\\nunderstood the nature of its discretion and exercised it, unless the record shows\\n\\notherwise, even if the court did not explicitly mention its discretion with respect to the\\n\\ngeneral grounds). In addition, after hearing the evidence and arguments of counsel,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            6\\n the trial court in the instant case said it would “take it under advisement” before\\n\\nreturning a decision. See Leggett v. State, \\n331 Ga. App. 343\\n, 345 (2) (\\n771 SE2d 50\\n)\\n\\n(2015) (finding, where trial court clearly indicated it would not rule on motion for new\\n\\ntrial until it had reviewed the transcript, then entered an order noting it had “heard\\n\\nthe evidence and argument of counsel[,]” that the appellate court “will not presume\\n\\nthe trial court committed error where that fact does not affirmatively appear”)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). “Under these circumstances, [Ward] has not\\n\\nshown that the trial court erred in denying his motion on the general grounds\\n\\nalleged.” Caviston v. State, \\n315 Ga. 279\\n, 284 (1) (\\n882 SE2d 221\\n) (2022).\\n\\n      2. Ward argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for\\n\\nfamily violence battery because the State failed to prove that Ward and Simpson were\\n\\nhousehold members and also failed to prove Ward’s intent. We disagree.\\n\\n             In considering the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a\\n      criminal conviction, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the\\n      evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\\n      of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\\n      reasonable doubt. It is the function of the jury, not the reviewing court,\\n      to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw\\n      reasonable inferences from the evidence. As long as there is some\\n      competent evidence, even though contradicted, to support each fact\\n\\n                                           7\\n       necessary to make out the [S]tate’s case, the jury’s verdict will be\\n      upheld.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted; emphasis in original.) Percell v. State, \\n346 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 219\\n, 219-220 (1) (\\n816 SE2d 344\\n) (2018).\\n\\n      OCGA § 16-5-23.1 provides, in pertinent part, that:\\n\\n      (a) A person commits the offense of battery when he or she intentionally\\n      causes substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm to another.\\n\\n\\n      (b) As used in this Code section, the term “visible bodily harm” means\\n      bodily harm capable of being perceived by a person other than the victim\\n      and may include, but is not limited to, substantially blackened eyes,\\n      substantially swollen lips or other facial or body parts, or substantial\\n      bruises to body parts. . . .\\n\\n\\n      [. . .]\\n\\n      (f) (1) As used in this subsection, the term “household member” means\\n      past or present spouses . . . or other persons living or formerly living in\\n      the same household.\\n\\n\\n      (2) If the offense of battery is committed between household members,\\n      it shall constitute the offense of family violence battery . . . .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            8\\n       Ward concedes in judicio that Simpson sustained visible bodily harm. He\\n\\nargues, however, that the evidence was insufficient to show that Simpson and Ward\\n\\nwere living or formerly living in the same household. Although Simpson initially\\n\\ntestified that she and Ward did not live together, when the State asked, “did you share\\n\\na residence, that’s what I’m asking[,]” Simpson responded, “Yes.” She also testified\\n\\nthat although Ward had a separate residence, “he stayed mostly at my house.”\\n\\nAlthough Ward “emphasizes that [Simpson] gave conflicting and self-contradictory\\n\\ntestimony[,] . . . [s]uch conflicts and contradictions are matters of credibility for the\\n\\njury to resolve; so long as some competent evidence supports the facts necessary for\\n\\nthe State’s case, the jury’s verdict stands.” Davis v. State, \\n244 Ga. App. 708\\n, 710 (1)\\n\\n(\\n536 SE2d 596\\n) (2000). The jury was authorized to find that Simpson and Ward were\\n\\nmembers of the same household.\\n\\n      Ward also argues that insufficient evidence showed his intention to injure\\n\\nSimpson, given the lack of eyewitnesses and her testimony that she slipped and fell,\\n\\naccidentally injuring her lip when it hit Ward’s forearm. As noted above, however, the\\n\\nevidence showed Simpson and Ward were arguing, he attempted to stop her from\\n\\nleaving the apartment, she told the police officer Ward hit her four or five times, and\\n\\n\\n                                           9\\n Ward fled the scene and hid in a trailer. From this and other evidence discussed above\\n\\n— in particular the evidence of the multiplicity of times Ward hit Simpson; the\\n\\nresulting visible, bloody injury; and the fact that Ward apologized to her afterwards\\n\\n— the jury was authorized to infer that he intentionally caused Simpson’s visible\\n\\nbodily injury. See Adams v. State, \\n280 Ga. App. 779\\n, 781 (\\n634 SE2d 868\\n) (2006)\\n\\n(“Intent, of course, may be inferred from circumstances.”); see generally Collins v.\\n\\nState, \\n283 Ga. App. 188\\n, 190-191 (1) (a) (\\n641 SE2d 208\\n) (2007) (finding that intent\\n\\nmay be inferred because “the incident occurred during a heated argument” and\\n\\nbecause of the perpetrator’s “subsequent flight[,]” as well as from other acts evidence\\n\\nadmitted to prove intent).\\n\\n      3. Ward argues that the trial court erred in admitting his 2018 conviction from\\n\\nhis guilty plea to family violence battery against his then-wife under OCGA § 24-4-\\n\\n404 (b). He contends that the prior conviction was not relevant to an issue other than\\n\\npropensity, in particular because the State introduced the prior conviction without\\n\\ntestimony or a proffer showing his intent or motive. He also argues that any probative\\n\\nvalue was outweighed by prejudicial effect. We disagree.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          10\\n       As an initial matter, this enumeration of error was not preserved for our review.\\n\\nAlthough Ward’s counsel did say at trial, “I would object to the 404 (b) evidence\\n\\nbeing introduced[,]” he gave no basis for the objection. “In order to preserve an\\n\\nobjection for appellate review, the specific ground of the objection must be made at\\n\\nthe time the challenged evidence is offered. Therefore, we review this enumeration\\n\\nfor plain error only.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Lopez v. State, \\n355 Ga. App.\\n\\n319\\n, 322 (2) (\\n844 SE2d 195\\n) (2020). To show plain error,\\n\\n      first, there must be an error or defect — some sort of deviation from a\\n      legal rule — that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned,\\n      i.e., affirmatively waived, by the appellant. Second, the legal error must\\n      be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. Third, the\\n      error must have affected the appellant’s substantial rights, which in the\\n      ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it affected the outcome\\n      of the trial court proceedings. Fourth and finally, if the above three\\n      prongs are satisfied, the appellate court has the discretion to remedy the\\n      error — discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error seriously\\n      affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\\n\\n\\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) \\nId.\\n\\n\\n      The State gave notice of its intention to introduce the conviction to show intent\\n\\nbecause it expected Simpson to testify, as she did, that her injury resulted from an\\n\\n\\n                                           11\\n accident rather than Ward’s intent to injure her. The State also argued to the trial\\n\\ncourt its need to introduce the conviction to show Ward’s motive to control his\\n\\nintimate partners through violence. The trial court ruled that the prior conviction\\n\\ncould be introduced to show intent and motive. At trial, the State presented a certified\\n\\ncopy of a conviction showing Ward had pled guilty to family violence against his then-\\n\\nwife. Ward now contends the State did not need the conviction to show motive or\\n\\nintent, that it impermissibly showed his bad character or criminal propensity, and that\\n\\nit was more prejudicial than probative.\\n\\n      OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) provides, in pertinent part:\\n\\n      Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts shall not be admissible to prove\\n      the character of a person in order to show action in conformity\\n      therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, including,\\n      but not limited to, proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,\\n      plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\\n\\n\\n      Under the three-part test for admissibility adopted by our Supreme Court, the\\n\\nmoving party must show that (1) the other acts evidence is relevant to an issue other\\n\\nthan the defendant’s character; (2) the probative value is not substantially outweighed\\n\\nby undue prejudice under OCGA § 24-4-403 (“Rule 403”); and (3) there is sufficient\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          12\\n proof that a jury could find by a preponderance of evidence that the defendant\\n\\ncommitted the other crimes. Jones v. State, \\n301 Ga. 544\\n, 545 (\\n802 SE2d 234\\n) (2017);\\n\\nOlds v. State, \\n299 Ga. 65\\n, 69-70 (2) (\\n786 SE2d 633\\n) (2016); Bradshaw v. State, \\n296 Ga.\\n\\n650\\n, 656 (3) (\\n769 SE2d 892\\n) (2015).\\n\\n      The threshold inquiry under the three-part test as set out above “is whether the\\n\\nevidence is probative of a material issue other than character.” Thompson v. State, \\n302\\n\\nGa. 533\\n, 539 (III) (A) (\\n807 SE2d 899\\n) (2017). The trial court in the instant case\\n\\nadmitted the evidence to show intent and motive, which are among the list of\\n\\ncommonly recognized permissible purposes set out in OCGA § 24-4-404 (b). As to\\n\\nintent, “a defendant puts his intent in issue when he pleads not guilty unless he takes\\n\\naffirmative steps to withdraw intent as an element to be proved by the State.” State\\n\\nv. Jones, \\n297 Ga. 156\\n, 161 (2), n. 4 (\\n773 SE2d 170\\n) (2015). Here, Ward pleaded not\\n\\nguilty. Additionally, given Simpson’s testimony that her injuries resulted from Ward’s\\n\\narm accidentally hitting her mouth, it is clear that the State’s burden of proving intent\\n\\nwas not relieved. Because the prior crime and the offense for which Ward was on trial\\n\\nare identical, the intent required to prove the crimes was necessarily the same. See\\n\\nBurgess v. State, \\n349 Ga. App. 635\\n, 640-641 (3) (\\n824 SE2d 99\\n) (2019) (finding that\\n\\n\\n                                           13\\n State satisfied first prong of the three-part test, even though it only introduced the\\n\\nprior accusation and conviction without offering testimony or a factual proffer where\\n\\nintent required for prior and current offenses was identical), overruled in part on other\\n\\ngrounds by Hill v. State, \\n360 Ga. App. 143\\n, 146, n. 4 (\\n860 SE2d 893\\n) (2021). The first\\n\\nprong of the Rule 404 (b) test was satisfied. We find no error, plain or otherwise.\\n\\n      We turn now to the second prong, the Rule 403 balancing test, under which the\\n\\ntrial court may exclude even relevant evidence if its probative value is “substantially\\n\\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\\n\\nthe jury or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation\\n\\nof cumulative evidence.” OCGA § 24-4-403. The application of the Rule 403 test is\\n\\na matter committed principally to the discretion of the trial courts, and “calls for a\\n\\ncommon sense assessment of all the circumstances surrounding the extrinsic offense,\\n\\nincluding prosecutorial need, overall similarity between the extrinsic act and the\\n\\ncharged offense, as well as temporal remoteness.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.)\\n\\nBradshaw, 296 Ga. at 657-58 (3). “The major function of Rule 403 is to exclude matter\\n\\nof scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its\\n\\nprejudicial effect.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Olds, \\n299 Ga. at 70\\n (2), n. 7.\\n\\n\\n                                           14\\n The exclusion of relevant evidence for this reason “is an extraordinary remedy which\\n\\nshould be used only sparingly, since it permits the trial court to exclude concededly\\n\\nprobative evidence.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Harvey v. State, \\n344 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 761\\n, 769-770 (2) (a) (ii) (\\n811 SE2d 479\\n) (2018). For this reason, “we look at the\\n\\nevidence in a light most favorable to its admission, maximizing its probative value and\\n\\nminimizing its undue prejudicial impact.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Anglin\\n\\nv. State, \\n302 Ga. 333\\n, 337 (3) (\\n806 SE2d 573\\n) (2017).\\n\\n      Ward asserts that the State presented no evidence other than the certified prior\\n\\nconviction itself, which does not provide details of similarity between the crimes and\\n\\nwhich he contends was prejudicial because it “provoke[d] an emotional response from\\n\\nthe jury[.]” In order to show a defendant acted with the criminal intent required by\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-23.1 (a), the probative value of the prior crimes evidence depends in\\n\\npart on the similarity of the offenses, regardless of whether there are differences in the\\n\\nmanner in which the crimes were committed. Burgess, 349 Ga. App. at 642 (3). Here,\\n\\nas Ward has pointed out, the State submitted only a certified copy of his guilty plea\\n\\nand conviction. As a result, “evidence that an accused committed an intentional act\\n\\ngenerally is relevant to show — the evidence, in other words, has some tendency to\\n\\n\\n                                           15\\n make more or less probable — that the same defendant committed a similar act with\\n\\nthe same sort of intent . . . .” (Emphasis omitted.)

When, as\\n\\nin the instant case, “the prior and current crimes are identical and the State introduces\\n\\ndefendant’s prior conviction demonstrating that he was previously convicted of an\\n\\nidentical crime requiring the State to prove he acted with an identical specific criminal\\n\\nintent, the similarity in the manner of commission of the crimes may be of lesser\\n\\nimportance.” Burgess, 349 Ga. App. at 642 (3). Here, in both instances, the State was\\n\\nrequired to prove Ward intended to injure an intimate partner. In the prior crime, that\\n\\npartner was his spouse. In the instant case, it was Simpson, with whom he shared a\\n\\nresidence. Given Ward’s not-guilty plea and Simpson’s testimony that Ward injured\\n\\nher accidentally, the evidence of the prior crime was highly relevant to the issue of\\n\\nWard’s intent to injure Simpson, making its probative value greater than its possible\\n\\nprejudicial effect. “Generally speaking, the greater the tendency to make the existence\\n\\nof a fact more or less probable, the greater the probative value.” Olds, \\n299 Ga. at 72\\n\\n\\n(2). Further, “because the defendant had unlawful intent in the extrinsic offense, it\\n\\nis less likely that he had lawful intent in the present offense.” (Citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted.) Kirby v. State, \\n304 Ga. 472\\n, 480-481 (4) (a) (\\n819 SE2d 468\\n)\\n\\n\\n                                           16\\n (2018). As discussed above, the prior guilty plea was important to the State’s case,\\n\\nthus enhancing its probative value, because while there was evidence from the police\\n\\nofficer that Simpson told him Ward hit her multiple times, this evidence was\\n\\ncontradicted by Simpson’s own testimony, and there was no eyewitness evidence.\\n\\n“Further, because the specific details of the prior crime were not disclosed, the\\n\\npotential for confusion concerning which crime [Ward] was on trial for was\\n\\nminimized.” Burgess, 349 Ga. App. at 643 (3).3\\n\\n      We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the trial court’s admission of Ward’s\\n\\nprior guilty plea and conviction for family violence battery.4\\n\\n      4. Ward argues that the trial court committed plain error in its jury instruction\\n\\non the admissibility of other acts evidence under Rule 404 (b). We disagree.\\n\\n\\n\\n      3\\n         Ward does not challenge the third prong of the Rule 403 balancing test, that\\nis, whether there was sufficient proof for the jury to find by a preponderance of the\\nevidence that Ward committed the other crime. See generally Harvey, 344 Ga. App.\\nat 771 (2) (a) (iii), n. 39 (noting that a conviction, even when based upon a guilty plea,\\nis sufficient proof that defendant committed the other act).\\n      4\\n        “Because the evidence of [Ward’s prior guilty plea and conviction] was\\nrelevant to prove intent, we need not decide whether it was also relevant for other\\npurposes, as the trial court found.” Rooks v. State, \\n317 Ga. 743\\n, 757 (4) (a) (ii), n. 14\\n(\\n893 SE2d 899\\n) (2023); accord Naples v. State, \\n308 Ga. 43\\n, 52 (2) (e), n. 9 (\\n838 SE2d\\n780\\n) (2020).\\n                                            17\\n        Ward asserts that the trial court, sua sponte, charged the jury prior to trial on\\n\\nsimilar transaction evidence under Georgia’s former Evidence Code, which was\\n\\nreplaced by the current Evidence Code in 2013, then following the close of evidence,\\n\\ncharged the jury under the current Evidence Code on the conditional admissibility of\\n\\nother acts evidence.5 He also argues that because the jury deadlocked before returning\\n\\na verdict, and sent a note asking the court to “please redefine the limitations\\n\\nconcerning the 2018 conviction of Mr. Ward[,]” this means “[i]t is possible that the\\n\\njury convicted Ward on the erroneous belief that he committed this crime because he\\n\\nhas been convicted of it before.” After receiving the jury’s note, the trial court re-\\n\\ncharged the jury using the language of its final charge. On appeal, Ward posits that\\n\\nneither instruction limited the jury’s consideration to the non-character issues of\\n\\nintent and motive.\\n\\n       Pertinently, Ward’s trial attorney raised no objections to the now-disputed jury\\n\\ncharges at trial, but did raise the issue at the motion for new trial hearing and in a post-\\n\\nhearing amended motion for new trial. We review such assertions for plain error. See\\n\\nState v. Kelly, \\n290 Ga. 29\\n, 31-32 (1), and 33 (2) (a) (\\n718 SE2d 232\\n) (2011) (providing\\n\\n       5\\n        See Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases, §\\n1.34.50.\\n                                            18\\n for review of jury instruction under plain error standard and setting forth plain error\\n\\ntest); Lopez, 355 Ga. App. at 322 (2) (setting forth plain error test).The court’s pre-\\n\\ntrial charge, in pertinent part, instructed the jury that:\\n\\n             Sometimes evidence is admitted for a limited purpose. Such\\n      evidence may be considered by the jury for the sole issue or purpose for that\\n      which the evidence is limited and not for any other purpose. The law provides\\n      that other alleged acts of this defendant that are sufficiently similar or\\n      connected and therefore purportedly related to the offenses for which\\n      the defendant is on trial may be considered for the limited purpose of\\n      showing, if it does, motive or intent in the crimes charged in the case now on\\n      trial. Such evidence, if any, may not be considered by you for any other\\n      purpose.\\n\\n\\n             The defendant is on trial for the offense charged in this bill of\\n      indictment only and not for any other acts[.] . . . Remember to keep in mind\\n      the limited use and consideration of the evidence of other acts of the\\n      defendant.\\n\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) The jury charge after the close of evidence was, in pertinent\\n\\npart, as follows:\\n\\n             Sometimes evidence is admitted conditionally[.] . . . In order to\\n      prove their case of family violence battery, the State may present evidence\\n      of other offenses for the purpose of showing defendant’s motive or intent. To\\n      do so, the State has offered evidence of another offense allegedly\\n\\n                                           19\\n       committed by the accused. You are permitted to consider that evidence\\n      for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant but only insofar as it\\n      may relate to that issue and not for any other purpose.\\n\\n\\n             The defendant is on trial for the offenses charged in this plea and\\n      indictment only and not for any other acts. Before you may consider any\\n      other alleged acts, you must first determine whether the accused\\n      committed any other alleged acts. If so, you must then determine\\n      whether that act sheds any light on the issue for which it was admitted\\n      and the crimes charged in the indictment of this trial. Such evidence is at\\n      most supporting evidence of some issues and may not by itself be the basis of\\n      conviction for the case on trial.\\n\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) These jury instructions are not identical to the Georgia\\n\\nSuggested Pattern Jury Instructions in effect at the time of trial because, Ward\\n\\ncontends, that pattern instruction included language not in the trial court’s charge:\\n\\n“‘You may not infer from such evidence that the defendant is of a character that\\n\\nwould commit such crimes.’ Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II:\\n\\nCriminal Cases § 1.34.10 (4th ed. 2007, updated July 2021).”\\n\\n      This does not end our inquiry, however. It is not necessarily error to fail to give\\n\\nan instruction in the exact language requested or, as in this case, the exact language of\\n\\nthe current pattern charge. See generally Tensar Earth Technologies v. City of Atlanta,\\n\\n                                           20\\n 267 Ga. App. 45\\n, 54-55 (7) (\\n598 SE2d 815\\n) (2004). This may be true even if a court\\n\\nuses language from a pattern charge that has since been replaced. See generally\\n\\nHampton v. State, \\n272 Ga. 284\\n, 287 (7) (\\n527 SE2d 872\\n) (2000) (finding that “although\\n\\nit may be the better practice for trial courts to instruct the jury on this point in\\n\\naccordance with the current language of the Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions . . .\\n\\nit is not error to charge the jury as was done here”) (citation omitted). The crucial\\n\\nquestion here is whether the “language in question was and is consistent with\\n\\nGeorgia’s pattern jury instructions . . . .” Taylor v. State, \\n306 Ga. 277\\n, 286-287 (3) (c)\\n\\n(\\n830 SE2d 290\\n) (2019).\\n\\n\\n\\n      Thus, to Ward’s point, although the jury charges per se did not include\\n\\nlanguage telling the jury it could not consider Ward’s prior guilty plea and conviction\\n\\nas evidence of his character, the instructions clearly charged the jury that it could only\\n\\nconsider the prior conviction in assessing Ward’s intent and motive in the crime for\\n\\nwhich he was on trial.6 As such, the charge necessarily excluded the jury’s\\n\\n      6\\n        Further, just prior to formally announcing that it was charging the jury and in\\nresponse to an objection near the end of closing arguments, the trial court instructed\\nthat the prior conviction could only be used “to show intent or motive, but not to\\nshow character.”\\n                                           21\\n consideration of the other acts for all purposes — including character — except\\n\\nmotive and intent. The trial court also clearly instructed the jury that the evidence of\\n\\nWard’s prior conviction “may not by itself be the basis of conviction for the case on\\n\\ntrial.” As a result, and having examined the charge as a whole, see Taylor, \\n306 Ga. at\\n\\n286\\n (3) (b), “[t]he language in question was and is consistent with Georgia’s pattern\\n\\njury instructions[.]” \\nId. at 287\\n (3) (c). Thus, “the charge of the trial court did not\\n\\ninvolve a clear departure from a settled legal rule, and the charge was not, therefore,\\n\\nplain error.” McKibbins v. State, \\n293 Ga. 843\\n, 854 (7) (\\n750 SE2d 314\\n) (2013) (finding\\n\\nno plain error where, inter alia, appellant pointed to no decision in which the appellate\\n\\ncourts had found error of the type appellant was asserting).\\n\\n      5. Finally, Ward contends that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting\\n\\nfor impeachment purposes Simpson’s out-of-court statement to her daughter, Jessica\\n\\nHolcombe, in which Simpson said she and Ward had “the big fight, the bad fight” and\\n\\nthat Ward “pushed” her to the floor. Ward argues that the State failed to lay a proper\\n\\nfoundation for the statement under OCGA § 24-6-613.7 We find no plain error.\\n\\n      7\\n        Ward also argues that because of statements in the State’s closing argument,\\nthe jury was allowed to consider the evidence not just for impeachment purposes, but\\nas substantive evidence. Ward points to no objection he made in the trial court to the\\nState’s closing argument, nor does he provide record citations to that closing\\n                                           22\\n        In the trial court, Ward objected to Holcombe’s testimony on the basis of\\n\\nhearsay. The trial court allowed the testimony for impeachment purposes. In the\\n\\ncontext presented here, a prior out-of-court statement is not considered hearsay as\\n\\nlong as the declarant is available to testify and is subject to cross examination about it.\\n\\nSee OCGA §§ 24-6-613,8 24-8-801 (d) (1) (A).9 As Ward contends, however, Simpson\\n\\ntestified before Holcombe, and Simpson was never recalled to the stand to explain\\n\\nwhat she told Holcombe.\\n\\n       As an initial matter, although Ward argues that the trial court erred because no\\n\\nproper foundation was laid for Holcombe’s testimony, Ward never objected below on\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nargument or citations to legal authority supporting this particular contention. Ward\\nhas abandoned this portion of his enumeration of error. See Court of Appeals Rule 25\\n(d) (1).\\n       8\\n        OCGA § 24-6-613 (b) provides that “extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent\\nstatement by a witness shall not be admissible unless the witness is first afforded an\\nopportunity to explain or deny the prior inconsistent statement and the opposite party\\nis afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness on the prior inconsistent\\nstatement or the interests of justice otherwise require.”\\n       9\\n        OCGA § 24-8-801 (d) (1) (A) provides that “[a]n out-of-court statement shall\\nnot be hearsay if the declarant testifies at the trial or hearing, is subject to\\ncross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is admissible as a prior\\ninconsistent statement or a prior consistent statement under Code Section 24-6-613\\nor is otherwise admissible under this chapter.”\\n                                            23\\n the basis of a lack of foundation. As stated previously, “[i]n order to preserve an\\n\\nobjection for appellate review, the specific ground of the objection must be made at\\n\\nthe time the challenged evidence is offered. Therefore, we review this enumeration\\n\\nfor plain error only.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Lopez, 355 Ga. App. at 322\\n\\n(2) (setting forth steps of plain error analysis); see also Hurt v. State, \\n298 Ga. 51\\n, 53-54\\n\\n(2) (\\n779 SE2d 313\\n) (2015) (finding that hearsay objection did not preserve for appellate\\n\\nreview contention that State failed to lay a proper foundation).\\n\\n       It is true that the State failed to lay a proper foundation for impeachment\\n\\ntestimony. But Simpson’s statement to Holcombe was merely cumulative of other\\n\\nunobjected-to evidence regarding how her injuries occurred. As noted above, the\\n\\npolice officer testified that Simpson told him Ward injured her by hitting her four or\\n\\nfive times. In addition, Holcombe testified that she observed bruising on her mother\\n\\nleading her to believe, based on her mother’s statements and history of abuse with\\n\\nother partners, that this “was a physical altercation.” The prior inconsistent\\n\\nstatement with which Ward takes issue was cumulative of this other evidence. See\\n\\nFraser v. State, \\n329 Ga. App. 1\\n, 2 (\\n763 SE2d 359\\n) (2014). Under these circumstances,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            24\\n we cannot say that any alleged trial court error “likely” contributed to the verdict.

       " Document(page_content='251 Ga. 1 (1983)\\n302 S.E.2d 542\\nJOHNSON\\nv.\\nSMITH.\\n39485.\\nSupreme Court of Georgia.\\nDecided May 11, 1983.\\nRehearing Denied May 11, 1983.\\nCharles W. Bell, for appellant.\\nRichard M. Cowart, for appellee.\\nWELTNER, Justice.\\nCrystal L. Johnson brought habeas corpus action under OCGA § 9-14-1 (b) (Code Ann. § 50-101), alleging that her infant daughter was being detained illegally from her custody by the respondent, Patricia Ann Smith. Ms. Smith defended on the ground that Ms. Johnson had entered into a voluntary oral contract by which she released the right of parental control over the child to her, as provided in OCGA § 19-7-1 (b) (1) (Code Ann. § 74-108). The trial court agreed and entered judgment for Ms. Smith.\\nMs. Johnson became pregnant in 1980. She was unmarried and employed as a teacher\\'s assistant in Savannah. The putative father took no interest in or responsibility for the child. Because of her uncertain financial condition and of her desire to provide a good home for the child, Ms. Johnson decided to put her child up for adoption after birth.\\nApproximately two months before the birth, Ms. Johnson met Ms. Smith through a mutual acquaintance. Ms. Johnson agreed to give custody of the child to Ms. Smith and to sign any papers necessary for adoption, while Ms. Smith agreed to accept the child and provide a good home for her. Ms. Smith informed Ms. Johnson that it was her understanding that, under the Georgia adoption law, either party might change her mind; each assured the other that she *2 would not change her mind. Ms. Johnson stated at trial that, at the time of this agreement, she intended for Ms. Smith to adopt the child.\\nLaVarez Nicole Johnson was born November 9, 1980. Three days later Ms. Johnson gave Nicole to Ms. Smith. Ms. Smith had the prepared adoption papers on that day, but they were not signed at that time nor at any time thereafter.\\nIn June 1981, Ms. Smith\\'s attorney sent to Ms. Johnson an acknowledgement of surrender of parental rights, requesting that she sign it. Ms. Johnson refused, indicating that she had changed her mind, and requested that the child be returned to her. Ms. Smith refused, and this action was commenced July 31, 1981, resulting in judgment for Ms. Smith.\\n1. Ms. Johnson appealed directly to this Court based upon our jurisdiction over habeas corpus cases. 1976 Ga. Const., Art. VI, Sec.II, Par. IV (Code Ann. § 2-3104). We then transferred the case to the Court of Appeals by order. The Court of Appeals interpreted our transferral as a determination that the case did not involve habeas corpus, but rather child custody, and dismissed for failure to file an application as required by OCGA § 5-6-35 (Code Ann. § 6-701.1). We then granted a writ of certiorari to consider the disposition of the case by the Court of Appeals.\\nAs Ms. Johnson was the natural mother of the child and contended that there had never been a transfer of custody to Ms. Smith, she properly brought complaint as habeas corpus, OCGA § 9-14-1 (b) (Code Ann. § 50-101), and the case should have remained with our Court. We now proceed to decide the appeal on its merits.\\n2. The record in this case demonstrates that the parties intended to effect an adoption of the child, and that the intended adoption failed due to a change of heart on the part of Ms. Johnson. Documents were prepared to comply with OCGA § 19-8-4 (Code Ann. § 74-404), which sets out the statutory procedure for surrender of parental rights. Despite at least two attempts to have Ms. Johnson sign these papers, this was never done.[1]\\nThe procedure for surrender of parental rights, set out in OCGA § 19-8-4 (Code Ann. § 74-404), requires strict compliance. \"Adoption statutes should be strictly construed and meticulously followed so that beyond all peradventure the adoption will not later be subject to *3 attack.\" Nelson v. Taylor, 244 Ga. 657, 659-60 (261 SE2d 579) (1979). Where an intended adoption fails due to a lack of compliance with the adoption statutes, an alleged surrender of parental rights will not then be upheld under OCGA § 19-7-1 (b) (1) (Code Ann. § 74-108), as such a procedure would tend to vitiate the policies underlying the adoption statutes. Bozeman v. Williams, 248 Ga. 606 (285 SE2d 9) (1981). \"This court will not convert an invalid consent to adoption into a valid contractual release of parental rights.\" Id. at page 608.\\nAs we conclude that this case falls squarely under the holding in Bozeman, we need not consider the validity of OCGA § 19-7-1 (b) (1) (Code Ann. § 74-108), or the effect of the enactment of the Adoption Act of 1977 (Ga. L. 1977, p. 201) upon that provision.\\nJudgment reversed. All the Justices concur, except Marshall, P. J., Clarke and Smith, JJ., who dissent.\\nNOTES\\n[1] Had Ms. Johnson signed a surrender of parental rights, she would have had an automatic right to withdraw the surrender by written notice within ten days after signing.

App. 251\\n, 257-258 (2) (\\n881 SE2d 699\\n) (2022).\\n\\nBut the Court of Appeals also concluded that evidence otherwise\\n\\nadmissible under Rule 418 remains subject to analysis under OCGA\\n § 24-4-403 (“Rule 403”). See McKinney, 366 Ga. App. at 258-259 (3).\\n\\nWe agree on both points and affirm the judgment of the Court of\\n\\nAppeals.\\n\\n     In August 2021, a Fulton County grand jury issued a 37-count\\n\\nindictment against McKinney and Julian Conley. The indictment\\n\\ncharged McKinney with twelve counts of violating Georgia’s Gang\\n\\nAct, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count each of\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and\\n\\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The charges stem from\\n\\nthe State’s allegations that on July 4, 2020, McKinney and Conley\\n\\nparticipated in an “armed takeover” of an area of Atlanta, placing\\n\\nbarricades in the roadway and prohibiting others from passing. The\\n\\ncharges against Conley, who is not a party to this appeal, include\\n\\nmurder for the shooting death of eight-year-old Secoriea Turner.\\n\\n     At issue in this pre-trial appeal is the State’s attempt to\\n\\nintroduce evidence of other acts by McKinney through Rule 418.\\n\\nRule 418 (a) provides:\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 2\\n      In a criminal proceeding in which the accused is accused\\n     of conducting or participating in criminal gang activity in\\n     violation of Code Section 16-15-4, evidence of the\\n     accused’s commission of criminal gang activity, as such\\n     term is defined in Code Section 16-15-3, shall be\\n     admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any\\n     matter to which it is relevant.\\n\\nThe rule also contains a notice requirement. See OCGA § 24-4-418\\n\\n(b). And it provides that the rule “shall not be the exclusive means\\n\\nto admit or consider evidence described” therein. OCGA § 24-4-418\\n\\n(c). OCGA § 16-15-3, referenced in Rule 418, is the definition section\\n\\nfor Georgia’s Gang Act. OCGA § 16-15-3 enumerates certain offenses\\n\\nthe commission of which constitutes “criminal gang activity.” See\\n\\nOCGA § 16-15-3 (1), (2). OCGA § 16-15-4, also referenced in Rule\\n\\n418, makes various forms of criminal gang activity additional\\n\\nseparate crimes; for instance, subsection (a) provides that “[i]t shall\\n\\nbe unlawful for any person employed by or associated with a\\n\\ncriminal street gang to conduct or participate in criminal gang\\n\\nactivity through the commission of any offense enumerated in\\n\\nparagraph (1) of Code Section 16-15-3.”\\n\\n     In McKinney’s case, the trial court considered the State’s\\n\\n                                  3\\n request to introduce evidence of the following three other acts under\\n\\nRule 418: (1) a May 2015 incident in which McKinney took a stolen\\n\\nfirearm to his school and pointed it at a classmate’s head; (2) a\\n\\nFebruary 2016 incident in which McKinney shot himself in the foot\\n\\nwith a firearm and then hid the gun in nearby bushes, claiming he\\n\\nhad been the victim of a drive-by shooting; and (3) an April 2017\\n\\nincident in which McKinney robbed two victims at gunpoint. The\\n\\nState argued to the trial court essentially that evidence of the\\n\\ncommission of any offense included in the definition of “criminal\\n\\ngang activity” in OCGA § 16-15-3 would be admissible under Rule\\n\\n418, irrespective of whether there was evidence that the defendant\\n\\nwas associated with a particular gang at the time of the offense or\\n\\nthat the offense was committed in furtherance of a gang’s interests.\\n\\nBased on the State’s proffer, the trial court entered an order\\n\\nconcluding that evidence of the April 2017 robbery incident was\\n\\nadmissible but evidence of the May 2015 school incident and the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 4\\n February 2016 shooting incident was not. 1 In its order, the trial\\n\\ncourt relied upon this Court’s decision in Rodriguez v. State, \\n284 Ga.\\n\\n803\\n (\\n671 SE2d 497\\n) (2009), in which we construed a prior version of\\n\\nOCGA § 16-15-4 (a) as requiring a nexus between the defendant’s\\n\\nact and an intent to further a gang’s purposes. Reading Rodriguez\\n\\nto establish “the necessity of reading the various sections of\\n\\n[Georgia’s Gang Act] in conjunction with one another,” the trial\\n\\ncourt concluded that “in reading OCGA § 24-4-418 and its reference\\n\\nto OCGA §§ 16-15-3 and 16-15-4 and those statutes in conjunction\\n\\nwith one another that a nexus between the prior act and an intent\\n\\nto further gang activity must be established for the evidence to be\\n\\nadmissible under OCGA § 24-4-418 in this case.”\\n\\n      The State appealed, arguing that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion by excluding some evidence of McKinney’s prior gang\\n\\nactivity, because the plain language of Rule 418 does not require the\\n\\n\\n      1 The State also sought admission of the evidence under OCGA § 16-15-\\n\\n9. But the State has conceded that OCGA § 16-15-9 requires proof of gang\\nassociation at the time of the other act for the act to be admissible under that\\nrule and has not challenged on appeal the trial court’s conclusion that the two\\nacts at issue here are not admissible under OCGA § 16-15-9.\\n                                       5\\n State to show a connection between a gang and the other act. A panel\\n\\nof the Court of Appeals reversed in part and remanded in part. See\\n\\nMcKinney, 366 Ga. App. at 251. The Court of Appeals agreed with\\n\\nthe State that the evidence of criminal gang activity admissible\\n\\nunder Rule 418 “is that activity defined in OCGA § 16-15-3.” Id. at\\n\\n257 (2). The Court of Appeals wrote that “[o]n its face, the statute\\n\\ndoes not require a nexus between a defendant’s commission of the\\n\\npredicate act and an intent to further the gang activity[.]” Id. at 257-\\n\\n258 (2). The Court of Appeals concluded that Rodriguez had “no\\n\\nbearing on the issue” presented in this case, because Rodriguez “was\\n\\ninterpreting only the definition of the crime found in OCGA § 16-15-\\n\\n4, not the language found in OCGA § 16-15-3 or Rule 418[,]” and\\n\\n“Rule 418 contains no such language similar to that found in OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-15-4[.]” McKinney, 366 Ga. App. at 258 (2). The court concluded:\\n\\n     Given the plain language of Rule 418, the trial court must\\n     find, prior to admitting the proffered evidence, that the\\n     conduct alleged, if proven, would constitute a violation of\\n     one of the listed statutes in OCGA § 16-15-3 or the\\n     commission of one of the crimes specified in OCGA § 16-\\n     15-3. It does not require the trial court to find any nexus\\n     between the alleged conduct and an intent to further gang\\n\\n                                   6\\n       activity.\\n\\nId. The Court of Appeals therefore determined that the trial court\\n\\nerred in excluding the other acts on the basis that they did not fall\\n\\nwithin Rule 418, although the Court of Appeals remanded for the\\n\\ntrial court to consider whether the acts should be excluded under\\n\\nRule 403. See id. at 258-259 (2)-(3). We granted McKinney’s petition\\n\\nfor certiorari.\\n\\n      McKinney appears to argue in his brief to this Court that\\n\\nadmissibility of evidence under Rule 418 requires a showing that the\\n\\nother act at issue was committed to further the interests of a gang.2\\n\\nWe disagree.\\n\\n      “When we consider the meaning of a statute, we must presume\\n\\nthat the General Assembly meant what it said and said what it\\n\\nmeant.” Deal v. Coleman, \\n294 Ga. 170\\n, 172 (1) (a) (\\n751 SE2d 337\\n)\\n\\n(2013) (citation and punctuation omitted)). “To that end, we must\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2  At oral argument, McKinney acknowledged that Rule 418 did not\\nexplicitly contain a nexus requirement, but suggested that it was a distinction\\nwithout a difference because regardless of what Rule 418 required, the\\nevidence would be inadmissible under Rule 403 without such a nexus.\\n                                      7\\n afford the statutory text its plain and ordinary meaning, we must\\n\\nview the statutory text in the context in which it appears, and we\\n\\nmust read the statutory text in its most natural and reasonable way,\\n\\nas an ordinary speaker of the English language would.” \\nId.\\n at 172-\\n\\n173 (1) (a) (citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Starting with the text, Rule 418 by itself contains no\\n\\nrequirement of a connection between the other act and gang\\n\\nmembership or interests in order for the act to be admissible.\\n\\nRather, it provides that in gang prosecutions, “evidence of the\\n\\naccused’s commission of criminal gang activity, as such term is\\n\\ndefined in Code Section 16-15-3, shall be admissible and may be\\n\\nconsidered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.”\\n\\nOCGA § 24-4-418 (a). OCGA § 16-15-3 defines “criminal gang\\n\\nactivity” as a list of specific offenses, stating simply that “‘[c]riminal\\n\\ngang activity’ means the commission, attempted commission,\\n\\nconspiracy to commit, or the solicitation, coercion, or intimidation of\\n\\nanother person to commit” those listed offenses. OCGA § 16-15-3 (1);\\n\\nsee also OCGA § 16-15-3 (2). This definition contains no reference to\\n\\n                                    8\\n a connection between the offenses and gang association or\\n\\nfurthering the interest of a gang.\\n\\n     McKinney argues that the trial court correctly concluded that,\\n\\nconsistent with Rodriguez, Rule 418 must be construed in the light\\n\\nof both OCGA § 16-15-3 and OCGA § 16-15-4. But Rule 418 turns on\\n\\nthe definition of “criminal gang activity” found in OCGA § 16-15-3.\\n\\nRodriguez, on the other hand, turned on nexus-creating language in\\n\\nOCGA § 16-15-4 that was at issue there but is not present in OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-15-3 or Rule 418. See Rodriguez, \\n284 Ga. at 805-807\\n (1).\\n\\nRodriguez considered OCGA § 16-15-4 (a), which at the time made\\n\\nit “unlawful for any person employed by or associated with a\\n\\ncriminal street gang to conduct or participate in criminal street gang\\n\\nactivity through the commission of any offense enumerated in\\n\\nparagraph (1) of Code Section 16-15-3.” The Court noted that “OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-15-4 must be read in conjunction with the definitions of\\n\\n‘criminal gang activity’ and ‘criminal street gang’ in OCGA § 16-15-\\n\\n3.” Rodriguez, \\n284 Ga. at 805\\n (1). But of course that was true, given\\n\\nthat OCGA § 16-15-4 (a) used at least one term, “criminal street\\n\\n                                     9\\n gang,” that was defined in OCGA § 16-15-3.\\n\\n     That does not necessarily mean that the converse is true, i.e.,\\n\\nthat OCGA § 16-15-3 must be read in the light of OCGA § 16-15-4.\\n\\nRodriguez reasoned that “the use of the verbs ‘conduct’ and\\n\\n‘participate’ confirm that the middle portion of OCGA § 16-15-4 (a)\\n\\nis referring to the ‘activity’ of the group” and that in the context of\\n\\nthe statute “both of these words imply the presence of others who\\n\\nare managed, controlled, led or guided in the ‘criminal street gang\\n\\nactivity’ by the defendant or who take part in or share in that\\n\\nactivity with the defendant.” \\n284 Ga. at 806\\n (1). And the Court said\\n\\nthat requiring no showing of a nexus with gang interests in order to\\n\\nsecure a conviction under OCGA § 16-15-4 (a) would render\\n\\n“meaningless or redundant” the phrase in the then-existing\\n\\nlanguage of OCGA § 16-15-4 (a), “to conduct or participate in\\n\\ncriminal street gang activity[.]” \\n284 Ga. at 805-806\\n (1). Limiting the\\n\\nvalue of Rodriguez for the case before us now, these words and\\n\\nphrases in the version of OCGA § 16-15-4 (a) in effect at the time the\\n\\nRodriguez Court construed them do not appear in any form in the\\n\\n                                  10\\n OCGA § 16-15-3 definition referenced by Rule 418. 3\\n\\n      Moreover, Rule 418 by its terms applies to all criminal\\n\\nprosecutions under OCGA § 16-15-4, not just those brought under\\n\\nOCGA § 16-15-4 (a). In addition to OCGA § 16-15-4 (a), OCGA § 16-\\n\\n15-4 contains nine other subsections creating distinct crimes, each\\n\\ndefined by unique language. Therefore, the meaning of Rule 418\\n\\ncannot turn on particular language in OCGA § 16-15-4 (a) — either\\n\\nthe version currently in effect, or the version that we construed in\\n\\nRodriguez.\\n\\n      McKinney’s only other argument is that construing Rule 418\\n\\nas not requiring a nexus with gang membership or interests would\\n\\nlead to an absurd result in that it would afford prosecutors virtually\\n\\n\\n      3 We also note that the phrase “to conduct or participate in criminal\\n\\nstreet gang activity” in OCGA § 16-15-4 (a) was amended the year after\\nRodriguez was decided to delete the word “street” from the phrase “criminal\\nstreet gang activity,” and that subsection now makes it unlawful “to conduct\\nor participate in criminal gang activity[.]” See Ga. L. 2010, pp. 230, 231 § 3.\\nThe Rodriguez Court had found this former text of OCGA § 16-15-4 significant,\\nnoting that the phrase “criminal street gang activity” in OCGA § 16-15-4 (a),\\nwas “not identical to the phrase ‘criminal gang activity’ as defined in OCGA §\\n16-15-3 (1).” \\n284 Ga. at 806\\n (1). No question is presented in this case regarding\\nthe continuing validity of Rodriguez following this amendment, and nothing in\\nthis opinion should be viewed as expressing any opinion on the issue.\\n\\n                                       11\\n unchecked power to obtain admission of other criminal acts in gang\\n\\nprosecutions. See Rodriguez, \\n284 Ga. at 805\\n (1) (“The various\\n\\nprovisions of a statute should be viewed in harmony and in a manner\\n\\nwhich will not produce an unreasonable or absurd result.” (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)). “But the fact that an application of clear\\n\\nstatutory text produces results that [a litigant or others] may think\\n\\nare unfair or unreasonable does not render the statute nonsensical\\n\\nor ‘absurd.’” Domingue v. Ford Motor Co., \\n314 Ga. 59\\n, 67 (2) (c) n.7\\n\\n(\\n875 SE2d 720\\n) (2022). And although “this Court may construe\\n\\nstatutes to avoid absurd results, . . . we do not have the authority to\\n\\nrewrite statutes,” Riley v. State, \\n305 Ga. 163\\n, 168 (3) (\\n824 SE2d 249\\n)\\n\\n(2019), so when the text is plain, we must follow it. And as we have\\n\\nexplained, the plain text of Rule 418 cannot be read to require the\\n\\nnexus for which McKinney argues.\\n\\n     Nevertheless, the breadth of Rule 418 is cabined by other rules\\n\\nof evidence. The Court of Appeals remanded the case for the trial\\n\\ncourt to consider whether evidence of the May 2015 school incident\\n\\nand the February 2016 shooting incident should be excluded under\\n\\n                                  12\\n Rule 403. See McKinney, 366 Ga. App. at 258-259 (3). And the State\\n\\ndoes not dispute that Rule 403 generally applies to evidence\\n\\notherwise admissible under Rule 418.\\n\\n     Indeed, we have made abundantly clear that “the Rule 403\\n\\nexclusionary rule generally applies to all evidence even when\\n\\nanother provision of the Evidence Code provides that certain\\n\\nevidence ‘shall’ be admissible.” Wilson v. State, \\n312 Ga. 174\\n, 189 (2)\\n\\n(\\n860 SE2d 485\\n) (2021) (citation and punctuation omitted). Such an\\n\\napproach “eliminates due process concerns posed by [other-acts\\n\\nevidence] that might be so prejudicial that the admission of that\\n\\nevidence would violate the defendant’s fundamental right to a fair\\n\\ntrial.” Id. at 189-190 (2). Under Rule 403, “[r]elevant evidence may\\n\\nbe excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\\n\\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\\n\\njury or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\\n\\npresentation of cumulative evidence.” “[O]f course, the trial court\\n\\nmust address whether . . . evidence is relevant under OCGA § 24-4-\\n\\n401 before determining whether its probative value (of course,\\n\\n                                 13\\n irrelevant evidence can have no probative value) is substantially\\n\\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403.” State\\n\\nv. Randall, \\n318 Ga. 79\\n, 82 (2) n.3 (__ SE2d __) (2024); see also OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-4-401 (defining “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any\\n\\ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to\\n\\nthe determination of the action more probable or less probable than\\n\\nit would be without the evidence”); OCGA § 24-4-402 (“Rule 402”)\\n\\n(“Evidence which is not relevant shall not be admissible.”). And Rule\\n\\n418 itself provides that evidence otherwise admissible under that\\n\\nrule may be considered only “for its bearing on any matter to which\\n\\nit is relevant.” This case does not call us to decide in the first\\n\\ninstance whether particular Rule 418 evidence is properly admitted\\n\\nin the light of Rules 402 and 403. But construing Rule 418 as not\\n\\nitself requiring proof that the other act furthered gang interests does\\n\\nnot leave the State with the unfettered ability to admit other acts in\\n\\nprosecutions under Georgia’s Gang Act, given the applicability of\\n\\nother Evidence Code provisions.\\n\\n     For these reasons, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded\\n\\n                                  14\\n that Rule 418 “does not require the trial court to find any nexus\\n\\nbetween the alleged conduct and an intent to further gang activity.”\\n\\nMcKinney, 366 Ga. App. at 258 (2). We therefore affirm the\\n\\njudgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court\\n\\nwith instructions that it remand the case to the trial court to\\n\\nconsider whether the other acts at issue should be excluded under\\n\\nRule 403 or any related rules.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

MILTON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n         MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n         Jarvis Lamont Milton was convicted of murder and other\\n\\ncrimes in connection with the shooting death of Frederick Cade.1\\n\\n\\n         1 Frederick Cade was killed on the night of August 13-14, 2017. Milton\\n\\nand Richard Stroud, Jr., were indicted by a Wilkes County grand jury on\\nFebruary 4, 2019, individually and as parties to a crime and co-conspirators,\\non charges of violating the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act (Count\\n1), malice murder (Count 2), felony murder (Count 3), possession of a firearm\\nin the commission of a crime (Count 4), and aggravated assault (Count 5).\\nAfter Stroud’s case was severed, Milton was tried before a jury in May 2019\\nand found guilty on all counts. On May 10, 2019, the trial court sentenced\\nMilton to life in prison, without the possibility of parole on Count 2 and to five\\nyears in prison on Count 4, to run consecutively to Count 2. Counts 1 and 5\\nwere merged into Count 2 for sentencing purposes, and Count 3 was vacated\\nby operation of law. Although it appears that the Gang Act charge was\\nimproperly merged into the murder conviction, see Lupoe v. State, \\n300 Ga. 233\\n,\\n239 (1) (\\n794 SE2d 67\\n) (2016) (“[T]he gang activity counts did not merge as that\\ncrime and malice murder each require proof of an element that the other does\\nnot.”), we decline to exercise our discretion to correct that merger error, which\\nhas not been raised by the State. See Dixon v. State, \\n302 Ga. 691\\n, 698 (4) (\\n808\\nSE2d 696\\n) (2017) (“[W]e have determined that, when a merger error benefits a\\ndefendant and the State fails to raise it by cross-appeal, we henceforth will\\nexercise our discretion to correct the error upon our own initiative only in\\n Milton appeals his convictions, asserting in his sole enumeration of\\n\\nerror that the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient for a\\n\\nrational trier of fact to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of\\n\\nthe crimes of which he was convicted as required by Jackson v.\\n\\nVirginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). We affirm\\n\\nfor the reasons that follow.\\n\\n      1. The evidence at trial showed that in August 2017, Cade was\\n\\nmarried to Shakevia Graves, who had an eight-year-old son, D.G.,\\n\\nwith Milton’s co-indictee, Richard Stroud, Jr. At that time, Milton\\n\\nhad been dating Shakevia’s twin sister, Shanevia (“NeNe”) Graves\\n\\nfor six to seven years.2 Shakevia and Cade’s marriage was volatile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nexceptional circumstances.”). Stroud was tried separately in November 2019,\\nand his appeal is before this Court as Case No. S24A0069.\\n      Milton filed a motion for new trial on May 28, 2019, and a second motion\\nasserting the same grounds on June 26, 2019; an amended motion for new trial\\nwas filed on August 15, 2022. The trial court denied Milton’s motion as\\namended on July 20, 2023. Milton filed a notice of appeal on July 28, 2023, and\\nan amended notice of appeal on August 9, 2023. This appeal was docketed to\\nthe term of this Court beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a\\ndecision on the briefs.\\n      2 Because the Graves sisters’ names are so similar and to avoid\\n\\nconfusion, we will refer to Shakevia by her full name and Shanevia by her\\nnickname, “NeNe,” which is how the witnesses and counsel primarily referred\\nto her at trial.\\n                                      2\\n The two would often argue and their arguments would sometimes\\n\\nturn physical. As a result, Shakevia often stayed at her\\n\\ngrandparents’ house, which was where NeNe was living. Shakevia\\n\\ntestified that there was “bad blood” between Cade and Stroud\\n\\nbecause Cade was jealous of the time Shakevia spent with Stroud\\n\\nand that the two men also argued over Stroud’s failure to contribute\\n\\nto D.G.’s support.\\n\\n     On Sunday, August 13, 2017, Cade and Shakevia were not\\n\\ngetting along and Shakevia had spent the prior week at her\\n\\ngrandparents’ house. That Sunday night, she and NeNe decided to\\n\\ndrive to a nearby business. While they were parked there, they saw\\n\\nCade driving up in his truck, and the sisters sped off, with Shakevia\\n\\ndriving. Cade followed them, and both vehicles drove through the\\n\\nneighborhood until Shakevia pulled into her grandparents’ house.\\n\\nCade pulled behind the sisters’ car but did not get out and instead\\n\\ndrove away.\\n\\n     In the interim, NeNe texted Milton to bring them cigarettes,\\n\\nand a short time later Stroud drove Milton to the grandparents’\\n\\n                                 3\\n house in Stroud’s car. NeNe got into the backseat of Stroud’s car,\\n\\nwhile Shakevia approached the car to get a cigarette. As Shakevia\\n\\nleaned inside the car, Cade “came out of nowhere” and pushed\\n\\nShakevia from behind. Both Shakevia and Cade fell inside the\\n\\nbackseat of Stroud’s car still “tussling.” Shakevia got out of the car\\n\\nand ran to the porch of the house, with Cade following her.\\n\\n     As this altercation was occurring, Stroud and Milton were\\n\\ntelling Cade to stop. Milton told Cade that he was “f**ked up about\\n\\n[himself] for putting [his] hands on [Shakevia] in front of her\\n\\ngrandma,” and Milton called Cade a “p***y n****r” for doing that.\\n\\nStroud argued with Cade for fighting Shakevia, his “baby mama,” in\\n\\nStroud’s car. When the sisters’ grandparents came out of the house\\n\\nin response to the altercation, Stroud escorted Cade off the porch,\\n\\nand Cade walked away. Shakevia testified that Stroud, Milton, and\\n\\nNeNe then drove away in Stroud’s car in the direction opposite from\\n\\nwhere Cade was walking. Shakevia stayed behind and began\\n\\nrepeatedly calling and texting Cade but never got a response.\\n\\n     Shakevia testified that NeNe returned to the house “in a rage”\\n\\n                                  4\\n and “cussing” less than an hour after she left. NeNe told Shakevia\\n\\nthat Shakevia was “stupid as hell” for calling Cade’s phone “while\\n\\nthey up there fighting.” When Shakevia asked what had happened,\\n\\nNeNe did not answer, but only said that “you and everybody else\\n\\ngoing to know what happened to him tomorrow.”\\n\\n     Cade’s body was discovered early on the morning of August 14,\\n\\n2017, lying on the pavement in an isolated area near the\\n\\ngrandparents’ house. Witnesses at the scene, including attending\\n\\nmedical personnel and police investigators, observed that Cade\\n\\nappeared to have suffered at least one gunshot wound to the arm\\n\\nand that he also had an injury to his torso. Emergency medical\\n\\nservices personnel called to the scene detected no signs of life.\\n\\nInvestigators also observed that Cade’s body and clothing were\\n\\nmuddy. And they discovered muddy shoe prints and a blood trail\\n\\nbeginning near a muddy area on the side of the road about 20 yards\\n\\nfrom Cade’s body. The blood trail ended at the body, suggesting that\\n\\nCade had traveled for some distance before collapsing to the\\n\\npavement. Blood samples taken from the blood trail on the roadway\\n\\n                                 5\\n were later identified as matching a blood sample obtained from\\n\\nCade’s body during his autopsy.\\n\\n     Agents from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (“GBI”)\\n\\narrived at the grandparents’ house around 5:00 a.m. to inform\\n\\nShakevia that Cade was dead. Afterwards, NeNe and Shakevia were\\n\\ninterviewed at the Wilkes County Sheriff’s office by GBI Agents\\n\\nDerrick Glasco and Austin Bradshaw. Agent Bradshaw first\\n\\nquestioned Shakevia at 6:20 a.m., and she told the agent that NeNe\\n\\nhad driven away with Stroud and Milton from the house, but she did\\n\\nnot know who had shot Cade. Meanwhile, Agent Glasco began\\n\\ninterviewing NeNe at 6:43 a.m., and as NeNe acknowledged at trial,\\n\\nher stories “changed numerous . . . times.” NeNe first told Glasco\\n\\nabout the altercation between Cade and Shakevia, but she never\\n\\nmentioned that Stroud or Milton were at her grandparents’ house or\\n\\nthat she was with them after the altercation. Instead, NeNe said she\\n\\nsmoked a cigarette after the altercation and went into the house.\\n\\n     When Agent Bradshaw joined Agent Glasco and NeNe at\\n\\naround 7:00 a.m., the agents began to video record the interview.\\n\\n                                  6\\n NeNe continued to maintain that she had not left her grandparents’\\n\\nhouse, although she eventually told the agents that Milton and\\n\\nStroud were at the house during the altercation between Cade and\\n\\nShakevia.3 But when the agents accused NeNe of lying and\\n\\nsuggested that she was covering for her boyfriend, Milton NeNe\\n\\nsaid, “Jarvis [Milton] shot Pooh,” which was Cade’s nickname. She\\n\\nstated that Stroud and Milton came over to the grandparents’ house\\n\\nto pick up NeNe and Shakevia, and as the sisters were getting into\\n\\nthe car with the two men, Cade came up behind Shakevia and\\n\\npushed her in the car, leading to the altercation. NeNe also admitted\\n\\nthat she left in Stroud’s car with Stroud and Milton after Cade left.\\n\\nNeNe said that as they drove away from the house, Stroud and\\n\\nMilton decided to follow Cade, and they caught up with him walking\\n\\nalong the road. When they drove up, Cade began yelling, and Milton\\n\\nand Stroud yelled back. Stroud then said, “F**k it, let’s go beat him\\n\\nup.” Both Stroud and Milton got out of the car while NeNe stayed in\\n\\nthe car. When the two men got out of the car, Cade immediately hit\\n\\n\\n     3 Neither GBI agent had interviewed Stroud or Milton at that point.\\n\\n                                    7\\n Stroud, leading to a “two-on-one” fight, with Stroud and Milton\\n\\nfighting Cade. NeNe then heard a gunshot, but she never saw a gun.\\n\\nShe thought Milton shot Cade because she heard Stroud say,\\n\\n“Damn, boy, you done f**ked up.” When the three drove away from\\n\\nthe scene, NeNe saw Cade running up the road, and he appeared to\\n\\nbe holding his arm. Stroud and Milton then took NeNe to her\\n\\ngrandparents’ house at her request, and she ran inside.\\n\\n     When asked at trial why her stories changed during the\\n\\ninterview, NeNe testified that she first said she had not left her\\n\\ngrandparents’ house because she was scared and nervous and did\\n\\nnot want anyone to know that she was at the scene of the shooting\\n\\nor in any way involved. She testified that after the GBI agents told\\n\\nher that her story was false, she told them that Milton shot Cade\\n\\nbecause she thought that was what they wanted to hear as they had\\n\\naccused her of trying to protect her boyfriend and they were\\n\\nthreatening that she could be charged with a crime if she did not tell\\n\\nthem what had happened. NeNe said that to avoid being charged\\n\\nshe “was willing to tell them anything.” Agent Bradshaw testified,\\n\\n                                  8\\n however, that he “just tried to make it clear to her how serious this\\n\\nwas, that a man had lost his life, and if she was in the vehicle, her\\n\\nwithholding information she could potentially be charged.” This\\n\\nportion of NeNe’s videotaped interview was played for the jury.4\\n\\n     Agent Bradshaw testified that, after he interviewed both\\n\\nsisters that morning, he went back to the crime scene at 8:20 a.m. to\\n\\nview the scene in the daylight, as the area had been dark earlier in\\n\\nthe morning. While at the scene, near an area on the side of the road\\n\\nwhere it looked like the mud had been freshly turned up and the\\n\\nblood trail and muddy shoe prints began, he discovered a gold\\n\\npendant “jammed up in the mud.” Agent Bradshaw later matched\\n\\nthe pendant to a profile picture from Stroud’s Facebook page, which\\n\\nshowed him wearing a necklace with a very similar pendant. The\\n\\nprofile picture was posted to Stroud’s page on August 3, 2017, ten to\\n\\n\\n     4 The video reflects that Agent Bradshaw told NeNe that he knew she\\n\\nwas leaving things out of her story because he had already talked to Shakevia.\\nHe told NeNe that the agents knew that she had left the house with Milton\\nand Stroud. Agent Bradshaw told NeNe that she was implicating herself by\\nnot being truthful and because a man had died, she could be charged with\\nmurder as she was in the car and lied to police about what happened. The agent\\nthen posited that NeNe was there when Cade was shot and saw what\\nhappened, but she was covering for her boyfriend.\\n                                      9\\n eleven days before Cade was shot.\\n\\n     Agent Bradshaw interviewed Stroud at 8:52 a.m. the same\\n\\nmorning. During the interview, Stroud gave the GBI permission to\\n\\nsearch his car, where investigators located mud and blood smears\\n\\nboth inside and outside of the vehicle. A blood smear located on the\\n\\nvehicle’s front center console was later determined to match Cade’s\\n\\nblood sample. Milton was arrested later that afternoon, and Agent\\n\\nBradshaw interviewed him at 2:52 p.m. that day. The agent testified\\n\\nthat Milton said that after the altercation occurred at the\\n\\ngrandparents’ house, Stroud drove him and NeNe to Milton’s house.\\n\\nMilton said they did not make any stops and denied having any\\n\\nknowledge or involvement in Cade’s death.\\n\\n     At Milton’s trial, NeNe again changed her story about what\\n\\nhappened that night. She testified that Stroud and Milton did not\\n\\ngo looking for Cade after they left the grandparents’ house, but,\\n\\ninstead, they just happened upon him walking in the road. She said\\n\\nStroud stopped the car, and Stroud and Cade were yelling at each\\n\\nother. Although NeNe stated in her interview that both Milton and\\n\\n                                10\\n Stroud fought with Cade in a “two-on-one” fight, at trial she testified\\n\\nthat Milton tried to be the peacemaker, that he told Stroud, “y’all\\n\\ncan deal with that on another time,” and that only Stroud fought\\n\\nwith Cade. NeNe testified that while Cade and Stroud were fighting,\\n\\nMilton stood beside NeNe’s side of the car smoking a cigarette, and\\n\\nthat he was still standing there when she heard the gunshot. And\\n\\nunlike in her interview where she said she heard Stroud say, “Damn,\\n\\nboy, you done f**ked up,” at trial she testified to hearing Stroud say,\\n\\nafter the gunshot, “damn man, I done f**ked up.” NeNe testified that\\n\\nshe did not see a gun, but when Stroud started walking to the car,\\n\\nshe saw that he had his shirt off and was wrapping his hand in the\\n\\nshirt. She could not see what was in his hand, but she said that\\n\\nStroud placed the wrapped shirt between his legs when he got back\\n\\ninto the car. And she testified that she never really saw Cade after\\n\\nthat, contrary to her statement in her interview that after the\\n\\ngunshot she saw Cade running away holding his arm.\\n\\n     The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Cade’s\\n\\nbody testified that it appeared that a single bullet entered and exited\\n\\n                                  11\\n his right arm, then re-entered his right torso where it struck several\\n\\nof his ribs, his right lung, and ultimately his heart, resulting in\\n\\nmassive hemorrhaging and death. The medical examiner did not,\\n\\nhowever, rule out the possibility that the wounds to the arm and the\\n\\ntorso could have been made by separate gunshots.\\n\\n      Additionally, the State played DVD recordings of two phone\\n\\ncalls Milton made at the jail shortly after his arrest. In the calls,\\n\\nMilton stated that he had been charged with murder and that he\\n\\nneeded to get the charge reduced to manslaughter.\\n\\n      2. Milton asserts that the evidence presented at trial was not\\n\\nsufficient for a rational trier of fact to find him guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt under Jackson v. Virginia.5 “Under [the Jackson]\\n\\ntest, we view all of the evidence presented at trial in the light most\\n\\n\\n      5 Although Milton purports to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\\n\\nas to all the charges of which the jury found him guilty, he was only sentenced\\non the charges of malice murder and possession of a firearm in the commission\\nof a felony. The other charges were either merged into his murder conviction\\nor vacated. Therefore, his challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to\\nsupport those crimes are moot, and we confine our analysis to the evidence\\npresented in support of malice murder and the firearm possession charge. See\\nAnderson v. State, \\n299 Ga. 193\\n, 196 (1) n.4 (\\n787 SE2d 202\\n) (2016) (defendant’s\\nclaims about sufficiency of evidence were moot for crimes that were vacated or\\nthat mergedr).\\n                                      12\\n favorable to the verdicts and consider whether any rational juror\\n\\ncould have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of\\n\\nthe crimes of which he was convicted.” Kirkland v. State, __ Ga. __,\\n\\n__ (8), \\n2024 WL 674830\\n, at *13 (Case No. S23A0942, decided Feb.\\n\\n20, 2024). See also Jackson, \\n443 U. S. at 319\\n (III) (B); Fitts v. State,\\n\\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 141 (3) (\\n859 SE2d 79\\n) (2021). “This limited review\\n\\nleaves to the jury the resolution of conflicts in the evidence, the\\n\\nweight of the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and reasonable\\n\\ninferences to be made from basic facts to ultimate facts.” Muse v.\\n\\nState, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n, 647 (2) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Milton was charged individually and as a party to the crime of\\n\\nmalice murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of\\n\\na crime. “A person commits the offense of murder when he\\n\\nunlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied,\\n\\ncauses the death of another human being.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (a). And\\n\\nunder OCGA §16-11-106 (b) (1), it is unlawful for any person to “have\\n\\non or within arm’s reach of his or her person a firearm . . . during\\n\\n                                  13\\n the commission of, or the attempt to commit . . . [a]ny crime against\\n\\nor involving the person of another.”\\n\\n      Moreover, “[e]very person concerned in the commission of a\\n\\ncrime is a party thereto and may be charged with and convicted of\\n\\ncommission of the crime.” OCGA § 16-2-20 (a). To obtain a conviction\\n\\nof a person as a party to the crime, the State must prove “that he\\n\\nintentionally aided or abetted in the commission of the crimes or\\n\\nintentionally advised, encouraged, counseled, or procured someone\\n\\nelse to commit the crimes.” Frazier v. State, \\n308 Ga. 450\\n, 453 (2) (a)\\n\\n(\\n841 SE2d 692\\n) (2020). “Conviction as a party to a crime requires\\n\\nproof of a common criminal intent, which the jury may infer from\\n\\nthe defendant’s presence, companionship, and conduct with another\\n\\nperpetrator before, during, and after the crimes.” Muse, 316 Ga. at\\n\\n648 (2) (citation and punctuation omitted). Thus, to prove Milton\\n\\nguilty of the charges of malice murder and possession of a firearm\\n\\nduring the commission of a felony, it was not necessary for the State\\n\\nto prove that Milton personally possessed a weapon or fired a gun at\\n\\nCade as long as the State proved that Milton was a party to the\\n\\n                                 14\\n crimes. See Scoggins v. State, \\n317 Ga. 832\\n, 836-39 (1) (a)-(b) (\\n896\\n\\nSE2d 476\\n) (2023) (even where evidence did not conclusively\\n\\nestablish which of the two defendants shot victim or had a weapon,\\n\\nevidence of a common criminal intent, including defendant’s\\n\\npresence, companionship, and conduct before and immediately after\\n\\nthe fatal shooting supported convictions as a party to the crimes of\\n\\nmalice murder and possession of a firearm).\\n\\n     Upon review of the record, we conclude the evidence at trial,\\n\\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, was\\n\\nconstitutionally sufficient to support Milton’s convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony. The State produced evidence that on the morning after Cade\\n\\nwas shot, NeNe told police that Milton shot Cade. Although NeNe\\n\\nsubsequently testified at trial that Stroud, rather than Milton, was\\n\\nthe shooter and that she originally identified Milton as the shooter\\n\\nonly because she felt pressured by police to do so, the jurors had the\\n\\nopportunity to review the portion of the video recording leading up\\n\\nto NeNe’s identification of Milton as the shooter, and it was up to\\n\\n                                 15\\n them to assess her credibility and decide which version to believe.\\n\\nSee Lewis v. State, \\n314 Ga. 654\\n, 659 (2) (\\n878 SE2d 467\\n) (2022) (where\\n\\nwitness provided conflicting testimony at trial about the events\\n\\nsurrounding the shooting and the identity of the shooter, it “was for\\n\\nthe jury to assess the credibility of the witnesses” and “to resolve\\n\\nany discrepancies in the evidence presented at trial.” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)).\\n\\n      Moreover, even if the jury had concluded that Stroud was the\\n\\nshooter, the evidence was sufficient to find Milton guilty as a party\\n\\nto the crime. NeNe initially told police that Stroud and Milton went\\n\\nlooking for Cade together after they had both argued with him and\\n\\nthat Stroud and Milton fought Cade together two-on-one after\\n\\nStroud said, “let’s go beat him up.” 6 Milton and Stroud also left the\\n\\nscene together in Stroud’s car after Cade was shot, and Cade’s blood\\n\\nwas found inside Stroud’s car. After his arrest, Milton lied to police\\n\\nabout what happened on the night of the shooting. Thus, the\\n\\n\\n      6Although NeNe testified at trial that they came upon Cade by chance\\n\\nand only Stroud fought Cade, it was for the jury to resolve this conflict. See\\nLewis, 314 Ga. at 659.\\n                                     16\\n evidence supported Milton’s presence and active participation\\n\\nbefore, during, and after the commission of the crimes.\\n\\n     We conclude that this and other evidence at trial was more\\n\\nthan sufficient to authorize the jury to find Milton guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt of the crimes of malice murder and possession of a\\n\\nfirearm during the commission of a crime, either as the shooter or\\n\\nas a party to the crimes.

Wilson Smith, Jr., John H. Smith, Robinson, Buice, Harben & Strickland, B. Carl Buice, for appellants.\\nGreer, Sartain & Carey, Tifton S. Greer, J. Nathan Deal, for appellees.\\nHAWES, Justice.\\nThe principal question presented by this appeal is whether the imposition of a business license tax by Hall County upon places of amusement charging an admission fee and excluding therefrom places of amusement which do not charge an admission fee but derive their revenue from other charges, violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. At the 1970 session of the General Assembly there was proposed a local constitutional amendment applicable to Hall County which authorized the Board of Commissioners of Hall County, Georgia, to levy, assess and collect for regulatory and revenue purposes license fees, occupational taxes and amusement taxes from any person, firms, or corporations (except those subject to regulation by the Georgia Public Service Commission) who may maintain a place of business or in any manner engage in any type of business in Hall County outside the limits of incorporated municipalities. Ga. L. 1970, pp. 1032-1034. That amendment was duly ratified by the voters of Hall County. It further authorized the board of commissioners to classify businesses and to assess different license fees, occupational taxes and amusement taxes against different classes of business. Pursuant to that amendment the Commissioners of Hall County passed a resolution imposing a tax of 5 percent on the amount paid for admission to any places, including admission to a series of events, admission by season ticket or subscription, said tax to be imposed *55 upon the person paying such admission, and said tax to be collected by the person, firm or corporation receving such payments for admissions. Lake Lanier Theatres, Inc., and John Thompson Theatre Enterprises, Inc., filed suit in the Superior Court of Hall County to enjoin the collection of said tax. Road Atlanta, Inc., was later allowed to intervene therein as a party plaintiff. The trial court granted the defendants' motion to strike or dismiss paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the plaintiffs' complaint, which paragraphs embodied all of the substance of the plaintiffs' contentions with respect to the illegality of the taxes, and that judgment is the subject of this appeal. A certificate of immediate review was filed. Held:\\n1. The constitutional provision respecting uniformity of taxation (Art. VII, Sec. I, Par. III, Code Ann. § 2-5403) refers to subjects of taxation other than property and means only that if one kind of business, privilege, franchise, right, etc., is taxed, the tax shall be uniform upon all of those who engage in that business. Mayor &c. of Savannah v. Weed, 84 Ga. 683, 686 (11 S.E. 235, 8 LRA 270); Singer Mfg. Co. v. Wright, 97 Ga. 114, 116 (25 S.E. 249, 35 LRA 497); Wright v. Hirsch, 155 Ga. 229, 235 (116 S.E. 795). As was observed in the latter case (p. 236), the power of the legislature to classify persons for the purpose of taxation is undisputed, and the power to classify necessarily includes the power to sub classify. It was never the intent of the framers of our Constitution that the legislature could not impose a tax on any occupation or calling unless it imposed a tax on all occupations and callings. McGhee v. State, 92 Ga. 21, 26 (17 S.E. 276). The only requirement with respect to classification is that the classification must be based on some reasonable ground. This is about as accurately as the rule can be stated. The classification must be based on some difference which bears a just and proper relation to the attempted classification. Wright v. Hirsch, supra, p. 240. From a reading of the authorities, it is plain that the right to classify *56 businesses and occupations for the purpose of imposing a license tax upon them lies largely within the discretion of the legislative body imposing the tax, and that in the absence of a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion the courts ought not to interfere with its exercise. The constitutional amendment authorizing Hall County to impose business license taxes vests discretionary power in the Board of Commissioners of Hall County, and we cannot say that in imposing the tax here complained of on places of amusement charging an admission fee and not upon other places of amusement they have abused their discretion. The reasonable exercise of that discretion, even to the extent of imposing a tax on one class and none on other classes does not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. Southern Transfer Co. v. Harrison, 171 Ga. 358 (155 S.E. 338).\\nNothing which was ruled by this court in Richmond County v. Richmond County Business Assn., 228 Ga. 281 (185 SE2d 399) conflicts with the ruling which we here make. In that case the basis upon which we invalidated the Richmond County ordinance was that it imposed the tax on businesses located outside municipalities while the funds derived therefrom were utilized for county-wide services for the benefit of all residents of the county whether within or without the municipalities, and, as such, it violated the due process and equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the U. S. Constitution. There was no attack on the ordinance in this case like the attack made in the Richmond County case. No issue was raised here as to whether the funds derived from the tax are to be used within municipalities as well as outside or merely outside. Furthermore, no question was raised in the trial court or sought to be raised in this court that the tax here is a sales tax imposed in violation of the provision of the Act approved February 20, 1951 (Ga. L. 1951, pp. 360, 387; Code Ann. § 92-3446a) which prohibits the imposition of sales or use taxes by political subdivisions of the State.\\n*57 2. The exemption from the taxes here in question of admissions paid where the proceeds inure exclusively to the benefit of a church or association of churches; or, to the benefit of a public school, private school, public or private college; or to any corporation or foundation organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes which is exempt under the Internal Revenue laws of the United States; or to any society or organization conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining a musical group and receiving substantial support from voluntary contributions; or to National Guard organizations, Army Reserve Units, posts or organizations of war veterans or their auxiliaries, provided no part of their earnings inures to the benefit of any individual or stockholder; or to benefits of a municipal or county police or fire department if no part of the net earnings thereof inures to the benefit of any private person or stockholder, manifested an intent to exempt charitable and non-profit enterprises from the burden of the tax and was not an unreasonable classification for the purposes of exemption.\\n3.

MAYO v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       COLVIN, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Justin Scott Mayo appeals his convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and other crimes related to the beating death of his\\n\\ngirlfriend, Stephanie Smith. 1 Appellant argues that the trial court\\n\\n\\n       1Smith died on November 4, 2017. On December 19, 2017, a White\\nCounty grand jury indicted Appellant for one count of malice murder (Count\\n1), one count of felony murder (Count 2) predicated on a count of aggravated\\nassault (Count 3), and an additional two counts of felony murder (Counts 4 and\\n6), each of which was predicted on a separate count of aggravated battery\\n(Counts 5 and 7). Appellant was tried by a jury from March 2 to March 6, 2020.\\nFollowing the close of the State’s evidence, the trial court granted Appellant’s\\nmotion for directed verdict as to Counts 4 through 7, thereby acquitting\\nAppellant of two counts of felony murder and the two counts of aggravated\\nbattery on which those felony murder counts were predicated. On March 6,\\n2020, the jury found Appellant guilty of all the remaining counts: malice\\nmurder (Count 1), felony murder (Count 2), and aggravated assault (Count 3).\\nOn March 10, 2020, Appellant was sentenced to life in prison without the\\npossibility of parole for malice murder (Count 1). Though the trial court\\npurported to merge Counts 2 and 3 into Count 1, Count 2 was actually vacated\\nby operation of law. See Williams v. State \\n316 Ga. 147\\n, 153 (3) (\\n886 SE2d 818\\n)\\n(2023).\\n      On April 1, 2020, Appellant filed a timely motion for new trial, which he\\n committed two reversible errors: (1) the trial court presented the\\n\\njury with a “confusing” verdict form that was inconsistent with the\\n\\njury charge; and (2) the trial court received and responded to a note\\n\\nfrom the jury during its deliberations without informing the parties,\\n\\nthereby depriving Appellant of his right to be present throughout\\n\\nthe proceedings against him under Article I, Section I, Paragraph\\n\\nXII of the Georgia Constitution and his right to effective assistance\\n\\nof counsel under the Sixth Amendment of the United States\\n\\nConstitution. 2 For the reasons stated below, Appellant’s claims fail.\\n\\n\\nsubsequently amended through new counsel on August 10, 2020, and again on\\nOctober 25, 2022. Because Appellant’s motion for new trial concerned the trial\\njudge’s ex parte communication with the jury, Appellant filed a motion to\\nrecuse on April 17, 2020, which Appellant supplemented with an additional\\nfiling on the same day. Appellant’s motion to recuse was granted on May 9,\\n2022, and a different judge was appointed to hear Appellant’s motion for new\\ntrial. Following the subsequent judge’s appointment, the trial court held a\\nhearing on Appellant’s motion for new trial on November 22, 2022, and denied\\nit by written order on January 27, 2023. On February 24, 2023, Appellant filed\\na timely notice of appeal directed to this Court. The case was assigned to the\\nterm of this Court beginning in December 2023, and decided on the briefs.\\n       2 Appellant never states expressly whether his claims arise under the\\n\\nUnited States Constitution or the Georgia Constitution. Though he does not\\ncite either constitution, Appellant avers in his brief that he “raised both the\\nstate and federal constitutional violations of Lowery [v. State, \\n282 Ga. 68\\n (\\n646\\nSE2d 67\\n) (2007)] and the failure to follow this Court’s Lowery procedures”\\nduring the hearing on his motion for new trial. Lowery concerned a defendant’s\\nright to be present at trial under the Georgia Constitution and his right to\\n\\n                                       2\\n       1. At approximately 2:00 p.m. on November 4, 2017, Appellant\\n\\nentered the White County Sheriff’s Office and told the detention\\n\\nofficer at the front desk that he thought his girlfriend, Smith, was\\n\\ndead. Law enforcement officers were dispatched to Appellant and\\n\\nSmith’s shared residence, where they found a trail of bloodstains\\n\\nfrom Smith’s car in the driveway, along the front porch, to the door,\\n\\nwhich had been kicked in. Inside, Smith was found deceased, lying\\n\\nnude in her bed, covered by a blanket and a small red towel or\\n\\nwashcloth over her eyes. Her body exhibited numerous and\\n\\nextensive injuries, and the bedroom itself was littered with broken\\n\\nand overturned objects. There appeared to be bloodstains on the\\n\\n\\n\\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See\\nLowery, \\n282 Ga. at 73\\n (4) (b). Appellant also cites Carter v. State, \\n273 Ga. 428\\n\\n(\\n541 SE2d 366\\n) (2001) and Hanifa v. State, \\n269 Ga. 797\\n (\\n505 SE2d 731\\n) (1998),\\neach of which concerns a defendant’s right to be present at trial under Article I,\\nSection I, Paragraph XII of the Georgia Constitution. See Carter, \\n273 Ga. at\\n429-430\\n (3); Hanifa, \\n269 Ga. at 807\\n (6). We therefore conclude that Appellant’s\\nchallenge to the trial court’s alleged infringement of his right to be present\\nconcerns Appellant’s right under the Georgia Constitution and that his claim\\nregarding effective assistance of counsel is raised under the United States\\nConstitution. We remind counsel to cite those portions of the constitutions on\\nwhich they rely. See Supreme Court Rule 19 (1) (g) (requiring the appellant’s\\nbrief to contain an argument section which “cite[s] the authorities relied on”);\\nSupreme Court Rule 22 (2) (“[B]riefs must contain full and complete citations\\nof authority.”).\\n                                        3\\n floor, and there were large amounts of dried blood in the nearby\\n\\nbathroom.\\n\\n     While law enforcement officers were searching Appellant’s\\n\\nhome, Appellant remained at the White County Sheriff’s Office.\\n\\nThere, he gave one written statement and two oral statements to\\n\\nlaw enforcement officers. Appellant’s second oral statement was\\n\\nvideo-recorded, admitted into evidence at trial, and played for the\\n\\njury. In Appellant’s second oral statement, which was consistent\\n\\nwith his first, Appellant explained that he and Smith had gone out\\n\\nthe prior evening with Smith’s friends to two bars in Helen, Georgia.\\n\\nAppellant stated that he “black[ed] out” from alcohol, but that he\\n\\npartially remembered getting into a verbal fight with Smith in\\n\\nHelen because she had been flirting with and “touching” another\\n\\nman at one of the bars. Appellant further stated that he did not\\n\\nremember whether he or Smith drove them home, but that he had\\n\\nsome memory of getting into a physical fight with Smith during the\\n\\ndrive, kicking in the front door, and continuing the altercation before\\n\\nand after Smith took a bath. Though Appellant’s reported memory\\n\\n                                  4\\n of the events was incomplete, he admitted that he was the sole\\n\\nperson responsible for Smith’s death.\\n\\n     A subsequent autopsy revealed the extent of Smith’s injuries.\\n\\nAccording to the testimony of Dr. John Wassum, an assistant\\n\\nmedical examiner for the GBI, Smith had dozens of contusions\\n\\nacross the front and sides of her body consistent with blunt-force\\n\\ntrauma. There were at least ten contusions on her face, covering\\n\\nboth cheeks and both eyes, her forehead, chin, jaw line, and ear lobe.\\n\\nFurther injuries consistent with blunt-force trauma were found on\\n\\nher abdomen, chest, arms, and hands, as well as on her knees, shins,\\n\\nand both ankles. An internal examination revealed that Smith had\\n\\ntwo broken ribs and a “large[,] ragged laceration” on her liver, which\\n\\ncaused large amounts of internal bleeding. Smith also had a\\n\\nhematoma that was “diffuse across the entire scalp,” as well as\\n\\nsubdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages in her brain. The fifth\\n\\ncervical vertebra in her neck was broken, which, in Dr. Wassum’s\\n\\nopinion, was likely caused by the blunt-force trauma to her chin. Dr.\\n\\nWassum determined that Smith’s cause of death was blunt-force\\n\\n                                  5\\n trauma to her head, neck, and torso.\\n\\n     At trial, Appellant conceded through counsel that he had killed\\n\\nSmith but argued that the jury should find him guilty only of\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter, rather than of murder.\\n\\n     2. On appeal, Appellant argues that the sequencing of the\\n\\nverdict form — which listed pre-printed options for malice murder,\\n\\nfelony murder, voluntary manslaughter, and aggravated assault, in\\n\\nthat order — was “confusing” because it was inconsistent with the\\n\\njury instructions in two related, but distinct ways. First, Appellant\\n\\nclaims that, though the trial court correctly instructed the jury that\\n\\nit could return a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter for\\n\\neither Count 1 (malice murder) or Count 2 (felony murder), the\\n\\nverdict form listed voluntary manslaughter only after Count 2. In\\n\\nAppellant’s view, the form therefore “implied that voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter was not a valid alternative for malice murder in\\n\\nCount 1.” Second, Appellant argues that the verdict form incorrectly\\n\\nimplied that the jury was required to determine whether Appellant\\n\\nwas guilty of malice murder and felony murder before considering\\n\\n                                  6\\n voluntary manslaughter, contrary to the court’s jury charge, which\\n\\ncorrectly provided that the jury must determine if there were\\n\\nmitigating circumstances that would reduce either Count 1 or\\n\\nCount 2 to voluntary manslaughter before it was authorized to\\n\\nreturn a verdict on either count. While both issues arise from the\\n\\ntrial court’s choice to list options for malice murder, felony murder,\\n\\nand voluntary manslaughter in that order, they present distinct\\n\\nchallenges to the verdict form, and, as explained below, only the first\\n\\nof these claims was preserved for ordinary appellate review. We\\n\\naccordingly treat them separately, and, after review, conclude that\\n\\nboth fail.\\n\\n     (a) During its charge to the jury, the trial court instructed the\\n\\njury on Appellant’s presumption of innocence, the State’s burden of\\n\\nproof, and reasonable doubt. The court also instructed the jury on\\n\\nmalice murder, felony murder, and voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n     In defining malice murder, the court explained that “[a] person\\n\\ncommits murder when that person unlawfully and with malice\\n\\naforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another\\n\\n                                  7\\n human being.” The court further instructed the jury that “[l]egal\\n\\nmalice is not necessarily ill will or hatred, but it is an unlawful\\n\\nintention to kill without justification, excuse, or mitigation.”\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) When defining felony murder, the court stated\\n\\nthat “[a] person also commits the crime of murder when, in the\\n\\ncommission of a felony, that person causes the death of another\\n\\nhuman being with or without malice.” Following the court’s\\n\\ninstructions regarding malice murder and felony murder, it stated:\\n\\n     After consideration of all the evidence, before you would\\n     be authorized to return a verdict of guilty of malice\\n     murder or felony murder, you must first determine\\n     whether mitigating circumstances, if any, would cause\\n     the offenses to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.)\\n\\n     The court then defined voluntary manslaughter as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\n     A person commits voluntary manslaughter when that\\n     person causes the death of another human being under\\n     circumstances that would otherwise be murder if that\\n     person acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and\\n     irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation\\n     sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person.\\n\\n\\n                                 8\\n After explaining voluntary manslaughter, the trial court\\n\\nstated:\\n\\n     The burden of proof is upon the State to prove beyond a\\n     reasonable doubt that the offense is not so mitigating. If\\n     you do not believe beyond a reasonable doubt the\\n     defendant is guilty of murder in Count l or felony murder\\n     in Count 2, but do believe beyond a reasonable doubt that\\n     the defendant is guilty of voluntary manslaughter, then\\n     you would be authorized to find the defendant guilty of\\n     voluntary manslaughter as to that respective count and\\n     the form of your verdict in that event would be: [“]We, the\\n     jury, find the defendant guilty of voluntary\\n     manslaughter[”] as to that count.\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) The court did not instruct the jury on any other\\n\\ncircumstances in which it was authorized to return a guilty verdict\\n\\nfor voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n     The trial court prepared a verdict form but did not discuss it\\n\\nwith the parties during the charge conference. The form began with\\n\\nCount 1 (malice murder) and provided pre-printed options for the\\n\\njury to mark whether it found Appellant “guilty” or “not guilty.” The\\n\\nform then listed the same options for Count 2 (felony murder).\\n\\nFollowing Count 2, the form stated:\\n\\n     After considering the evidence in this case:\\n\\n                                 9\\n      ( ) We, the jury, finds [sic] the evidence DOES show\\n     sufficient mitigation and that [Appellant] [is] guilty of\\n     the offense of VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.\\n\\n     ( ) We, the Jury, finds [sic] the evidence DOES NOT show\\n     sufficient mitigation and that [Appellant] [is] not guilty\\n     of the offense of VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.\\n\\n(Emphasis in the original.) The form concluded by listing the options\\n\\nof guilty and not guilty for Count 3, aggravated assault.\\n\\n     Immediately following the jury charge, Appellant objected to\\n\\nthe verdict form on the ground that it was inconsistent with the jury\\n\\ninstructions. Appellant argued then, as he does now, that the verdict\\n\\nform should begin with voluntary manslaughter, rather than\\n\\nmurder, so as to make it consistent with the jury charge. The trial\\n\\ncourt overruled Appellant’s objection.\\n\\n     During the jury’s deliberations, the jury wrote a note to the\\n\\ntrial court asking, “On Count 2, if we find the defendant guilty of\\n\\nfelony murder[,] do we mark anything on the second section\\n\\nindicating guilty or not guilty of voluntary manslaughter?” This note\\n\\nwas delivered by the bailiff to the trial judge in chambers. Neither\\n\\n\\n                                 10\\n party was alerted at that time to the jury’s note nor consulted about\\n\\nthe trial court’s response. The trial judge wrote on the note, “No, you\\n\\nwill leave that portion blank,” and the note was returned to the jury.\\n\\n     When the jury finished deliberating, it was asked to read its\\n\\nverdict, and the jury foreperson pronounced the defendant guilty of\\n\\nCounts 1 and 2. After the foreperson read Count 2, the trial judge\\n\\ninterrupted and asked, “And before we go any further, . . . did the\\n\\njury consider . . . whether there were any mitigating circumstances\\n\\nthat would justify voluntary manslaughter?” The foreperson\\n\\nresponded, “Yes.” The court then asked the foreperson to continue,\\n\\nand the foreperson announced that the jury had found Appellant\\n\\nguilty of Count 3, aggravated assault. Consistent with the trial\\n\\ncourt’s response to the note, the jury left blank the portion of the\\n\\nverdict form regarding voluntary manslaughter. The jury was\\n\\npolled, and each member confirmed the verdict.\\n\\n     (b) A verdict form in a criminal case is erroneous when “the\\n\\nform would mislead jurors of reasonable understanding, or the trial\\n\\ncourt erroneously instructed the jury on . . . the possible verdicts\\n\\n                                  11\\n that could be returned, or how the verdict should be entered on the\\n\\nprinted form.” Ruff v. State, \\n314 Ga. 386\\n, 388 (2) (\\n877 SE2d 239\\n)\\n\\n(2022) (citation and punctuation omitted). When determining\\n\\nwhether there is error regarding a preprinted verdict form, the “form\\n\\nis treated as part of the jury instructions which are read and\\n\\nconsidered as a whole.” Atkins v. State, \\n310 Ga. 246\\n, 252 (3) (\\n850\\n\\nSE2d 103\\n) (2020). See also Rowland v. State, \\n306 Ga. 59\\n, 67-68 (6),\\n\\n(\\n829 SE2d 81\\n) (2019) (“In deciding whether a verdict form accurately\\n\\npresented the law and properly guided the jury, we review the form’s\\n\\nlanguage in conjunction with the rest of the trial court’s jury\\n\\ninstructions.”).\\n\\n     (i) As an initial matter, the State argues that Appellant failed\\n\\nto preserve for ordinary appellate review his argument that\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter should have also been included on the\\n\\nverdict form immediately after Count 1, as it had been after Count\\n\\n2, because Appellant failed to object on that specific ground at trial.\\n\\nSee OCGA § 17-8-58 (providing that a party who objects to any\\n\\nportion of the jury charge must “inform the court of the specific\\n\\n                                  12\\n objection and the grounds for such objection before the jury retires\\n\\nto deliberate,” and that a failure to make such an objection “shall\\n\\npreclude appellate review of such portion of the jury charge, unless\\n\\nsuch portion of the jury charge constitutes plain error which affects\\n\\nsubstantial rights of the parties.”). We agree, and therefore review\\n\\nfor plain error Appellant’s claim that the trial court should have\\n\\nlisted voluntary manslaughter after Count 1, in addition to Count 2.\\n\\nSee Jones v. State, \\n303 Ga. 496\\n, 501 (III) (\\n813 SE2d 360\\n) (2018)\\n\\n(applying plain error review under OCGA § 17-8-58 where the\\n\\nappellant objected to the jury charge but did not “make the specific\\n\\nobjection that he now raises on appeal”); Cheddersingh v. State, \\n290\\n\\nGa. 680\\n, 682-683 (2) (\\n724 SE2d 366\\n) (2012) (applying plain error\\n\\nreview under OCGA § 17-8-58 to an unpreserved claim regarding\\n\\nthe verdict form). To show plain error:\\n\\n     the appellant must demonstrate that the instructional\\n     error was not affirmatively waived, was obvious beyond\\n     reasonable dispute, likely affected the outcome of the\\n     proceedings, and seriously affected the fairness, integrity,\\n     or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Satisfying all\\n     four prongs of this standard is difficult, as it should be.\\n\\n\\n                                 13\\n State v. Owens, \\n312 Ga. 212\\n, 219 (3) (\\n862 SE2d 125\\n) (2021). The\\n\\nfailure to meet a single element of this test “dooms a plain error\\n\\nclaim.” Rogers v. State, \\n311 Ga. 634\\n, 638 (3) (\\n859 SE2d 92\\n) (2021).\\n\\n     Here, Appellant has failed to show that the trial court’s\\n\\ndecision to include an option on the verdict form for voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter only after Count 2 instead of after both murder counts\\n\\nlikely affected the outcome of the proceedings. Though there may\\n\\nhave been better ways to formulate or sequence the verdict form, see\\n\\nChapman v. State, \\n258 Ga. 214\\n, 216 (4) (\\n367 SE2d 541\\n) (1988) (“We\\n\\nreiterate here our opinion . . . that it would be safer to omit\\n\\npreprinted terms of ‘guilty’ and ‘not guilty’ from any verdict form\\n\\nsubmitted to the jury and to require the verdict be completed by the\\n\\nhand of the jury.” (citation and punctuation omitted)), the trial court\\n\\ncorrectly instructed the jury that voluntary manslaughter was an\\n\\noption for both murder counts. Specifically, as recounted above, the\\n\\ntrial court instructed the jury that it was required to determine\\n\\n“whether mitigating circumstances . . . would cause the offenses” of\\n\\nmalice murder or felony murder “to be reduced to voluntary\\n\\n                                  14\\n manslaughter.” The court further instructed the jury that if it did\\n\\nnot believe Appellant was guilty of malice murder or felony murder\\n\\nbut did believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was guilty\\n\\nof voluntary manslaughter, then it “would be authorized to find the\\n\\ndefendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter as to that respective\\n\\ncount.” (Emphasis supplied.) In light of these instructions, the\\n\\ncorrectness of which Appellant concedes, and which we are required\\n\\nto view together with the verdict form, it is likely that the jury\\n\\nunderstood the verdict form’s preprinted options for voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter were meant to apply to both counts of murder, rather\\n\\nthan only to Count 2 (felony murder), and it is unlikely that the\\n\\nstructure of the verdict form affected the outcome of the proceedings\\n\\nwith respect to Count 1, as Appellant contends. We therefore\\n\\nconclude that the trial court did not plainly err by listing voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter only after Count 2. See Leeks v. State, \\n296 Ga. 515\\n,\\n\\n522 (6) (\\n769 SE2d 296\\n) (2015) (holding that it was not error for the\\n\\ntrial court to refuse, over objection, to use a special verdict form\\n\\nlisting voluntary manslaughter after each count of murder, and to\\n\\n                                 15\\n instead use a general verdict form with pre-printed options of\\n\\n“guilty” and “not guilty” where the court instructed the jury on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter and where there was “sufficient space\\n\\nunderneath each count for the jury to write in a lesser included\\n\\noffense or another offense.”).\\n\\n     Appellant appears to argue that the jury note implied the\\n\\njurors were “confused” and they did not understand that voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter was a possible alternative to malice murder. As\\n\\nstated above, the jury asked, “On Count 2, if we find the defendant\\n\\nguilty of felony murder[,] do we mark anything on the second section\\n\\nindicating guilty or not guilty of voluntary manslaughter?”\\n\\nAppellant appears to suggest that the framing of the jury’s question,\\n\\nwhich concerns only Count 2, shows that the jury did not have\\n\\nsimilar questions with respect to Count 1. This further implies that\\n\\nthe jury did not have such questions because they did not\\n\\nunderstand that they could convict Appellant of voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter for Count 1.\\n\\n     To the extent any such implication arises, however, it is\\n\\n                                 16\\n insufficient to rebut “the presumption that qualified jurors, in the\\n\\nabsence of clear evidence to the contrary, followed the instructions\\n\\nof the trial court” to consider voluntary manslaughter with respect\\n\\nto each of Appellant’s murder charges. Herring v. State, \\n277 Ga. 317\\n,\\n\\n320 (6) (c) (\\n588 SE2d 711\\n) (2003) (emphasis supplied). The fact that\\n\\nthe jury failed to ask a similar question with respect to Count 1 is\\n\\nnot clear evidence that the jurors ignored the court’s instructions or\\n\\nthat they were confused: it could be that the jury asked this question\\n\\nafter considering any mitigating evidence and determining that\\n\\nAppellant was guilty of felony murder, but before reaching a\\n\\nconsensus on malice murder, and that the Court’s response to its\\n\\nquestion forestalled further similar questions. Other explanations\\n\\nare possible. As such, the jury note falls short of the clear evidence\\n\\nneeded to rebut the presumption of jurors’ adherence to the court’s\\n\\ninstructions. See Herring, \\n277 Ga. at 320\\n (6) (c).\\n\\n     (ii) In Appellant’s second claim regarding the verdict form, he\\n\\nargues that the form improperly listed malice murder and felony\\n\\nmurder before voluntary manslaughter, thereby implying that the\\n\\n                                  17\\n jury should determine its verdicts on those charges prior to\\n\\nconsidering whether there was mitigating evidence that would\\n\\nreduce these charges. Though Appellant preserved this claim for\\n\\nordinary appellate review by objecting at trial, his claim fails.\\n\\n     In Van v. State, \\n294 Ga. 464\\n (\\n754 SE2d 355\\n) (2014), this Court\\n\\nconsidered an almost identical argument regarding the use of a\\n\\nverdict form that listed malice murder, felony murder, and\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter in the same order as the form used here.\\n\\nSee Van, \\n294 Ga. at 467\\n (4). There, we held that “[m]erely listing the\\n\\noffenses on the verdict form in order of malice murder, felony\\n\\nmurder, and voluntary manslaughter did not constitute reversible\\n\\nerror” where the trial court had otherwise properly instructed the\\n\\njurors on the presumption of innocence, the State’s burden of proof,\\n\\nthe possible verdicts that could be returned, and how to enter the\\n\\nverdict on the printed form. \\nId.\\n\\n\\n     Appellant concedes that the trial court’s formal charge to the\\n\\njury — which covered Appellant’s presumption of innocence, the\\n\\nState’s burden of proof, the possible verdicts for each charge and how\\n\\n                                   18\\n to enter such verdicts on the printed form — was correct, but he\\n\\ncontends that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury\\n\\nregarding the verdict form when responding to its note. We therefore\\n\\nconsider whether the court erred in this regard.\\n\\n     As recounted above, during the jury’s deliberations, it sent a\\n\\nnote to the court asking, “On Count 2, if we find the defendant guilty\\n\\nof felony murder[,] do we mark anything on the second section\\n\\nindicating guilty or not guilty of voluntary manslaughter?” and the\\n\\ncourt responded, “No, you will leave that portion blank.” Appellant\\n\\nargues that this response was erroneous: in Appellant’s view, the\\n\\ncourt’s response was akin to “telling the jury it should not even make\\n\\na decision on voluntary manslaughter if it voted to convict on felony\\n\\nmurder.”\\n\\n     Appellant has raised two issues with the court’s response,\\n\\narguing that, consistent with this instruction, (1) the jury could\\n\\ndetermine Appellant was guilty of felony murder without\\n\\nconsidering whether there were mitigating circumstances that\\n\\nwould reduce that offense to voluntary manslaughter or (2) the jury\\n\\n                                 19\\n could determine that Appellant was guilty of both felony murder and\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter (but leave the portion of the verdict\\n\\ncorresponding to voluntary manslaughter blank, in accordance with\\n\\nthe court’s instruction).3\\n\\n      We do not construe the court’s response to the note in a\\n\\nvacuum, however; it was but one instruction that must be considered\\n\\ntogether with the court’s other instructions as a whole. Appellant\\n\\nargues that the court’s response permitted the jury to find the\\n\\ndefendant guilty of felony murder without considering evidence in\\n\\nmitigation. But, as we have already noted, the court previously\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 These options would be problematic because, as we explained in Edge\\n\\nv. State, \\n261 Ga. 865\\n (\\n414 SE2d 463\\n) (1992), a defendant cannot be convicted\\nof both felony murder and voluntary manslaughter for the same underlying\\nassault, and because, where there is at least slight evidence of voluntary\\nmanslaughter, “a sequential charge requiring the jury to consider voluntary\\nmanslaughter only if they have considered and found the defendant not guilty\\nof malice murder and felony murder is not appropriate.” See Edge, \\n261 Ga. at\\n865-867\\n (2). We have held, however, that where, as here, the court instructs\\nthe jury it must first determine whether “mitigating evidence, if any, would\\ncause the offense to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter,” before the jury is\\n“authorized to return a verdict of guilty of malice murder or felony murder,”\\nthe jury charge is not improperly sequential in violation of Edge. See Elvie v.\\nState, \\n289 Ga. 779\\n, 780 (2) (\\n716 SE2d 170\\n) (2011) (explaining that the pattern\\ncharge referenced above “has frequently been relied upon in determining that\\nthe jury was not given improper sequential instructions in violation of Edge”).\\n                                      20\\n instructed the jury that it “must first determine” whether there were\\n\\nmitigating circumstances that would reduce felony murder to\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter “before” the jury “would be authorized to\\n\\nreturn a verdict of guilty” on the felony murder count. When the\\n\\ncourt’s response to the jury note is considered together with this\\n\\ninstruction, Appellant’s first argument fails. It makes no difference\\n\\nthat the court did not recharge the jury that it must first determine\\n\\nwhether there were mitigating circumstances before it was\\n\\nauthorized to find the defendant guilty of felony murder: because the\\n\\njury did not request a recharge on this instruction, the court was\\n\\nwithin its sound discretion not to give it. See Barnes v. State, \\n305\\n\\nGa. 18\\n, 23 (3) (\\n823 SE2d 302\\n) (2019) (“A trial court has a duty to\\n\\nrecharge the jury on issues for which the jury requests a recharge.\\n\\nAs a general matter, however, where no such request has been made\\n\\n[by the jury], the need, breadth, and formation of additional jury\\n\\ninstructions are left to the sound discretion of the trial court.”).\\n\\n     Appellant’s second argument also fails. Appellant claimed at\\n\\ntrial that if the jury followed the trial court’s direction to leave a\\n\\n                                   21\\n portion of the verdict form blank, we would not know if the jury\\n\\nfound Appellant guilty of both felony murder and voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. But the only circumstance under which the court\\n\\nauthorized the jury to return a verdict of guilty of voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter for Count 2 was if, after considering evidence in\\n\\nmitigation, the jury did “not believe beyond a reasonable doubt the\\n\\ndefendant is guilty of . . . felony murder.” Specifically, the court\\n\\ninstructed the jury that a guilty verdict of voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nfor Count 2 required the following: (1) proof by the State of “every\\n\\nessential element” of felony murder “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2)\\n\\nthe State’s failure “to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\\n\\noffense [was] not . . . mitigat[ed]; and (3) proof beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt that Appellant “cause[d] the death of another human being\\n\\nunder circumstances that would otherwise be murder” (emphasis\\n\\nsupplied); but for (4) the jury’s determination beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt that Appellant acted “solely as a result of a sudden, violent,\\n\\nand irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient\\n\\nto excite such passion in a reasonable person.” Further, as\\n\\n                                 22\\n previously explained, the court instructed the jury that it must\\n\\nconsider evidence in mitigation before returning a verdict of guilty\\n\\nfor felony murder. Considering the court’s response to the note\\n\\ntogether with its previous instructions, as we must, the trial court’s\\n\\ninstructions did not permit the jury to find the defendant guilty of\\n\\nboth felony murder and voluntary manslaughter at the same time\\n\\nwhile leaving the voluntary manslaughter portion of the verdict\\n\\nform blank. Thus, in the context of the court’s other instructions, the\\n\\ncourt’s response was within its discretion and not incorrect. See\\n\\nWhite v. State, \\n291 Ga. 7\\n, 9 (3) (\\n727 SE2d 109\\n) (2012) (no error where\\n\\nthe trial court accepted a verdict that found the defendant guilty of\\n\\nfelony murder but left the portion of the verdict form corresponding\\n\\nto voluntary manslaughter blank); Barnes, \\n305 Ga. at 23\\n (3).\\n\\n     Appellant nonetheless argues that the jury’s note shows it had\\n\\nalready determined Appellant was guilty of felony murder without\\n\\nconsidering voluntary manslaughter, in violation of the jury charge.\\n\\nWe disagree. Because the jury note asked how to complete the\\n\\nverdict form “if” the jury found the defendant guilty of murder, we\\n\\n                                  23\\n cannot conclude from it that the jury had already made such a\\n\\ndetermination or that it made such a determination without first\\n\\nconsidering evidence in mitigation. This is especially true where the\\n\\njury foreperson later confirmed during his recitation of the verdict\\n\\nthat the jury had considered evidence in mitigation as instructed.\\n\\nSee Herring, \\n277 Ga. at 320\\n (6) (c) (“While a verdict form that\\n\\ndemonstrates    the   jury   considered   and   rejected   voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter is helpful, its absence does not overcome the\\n\\npresumption that qualified jurors, in the absence of clear evidence\\n\\nto the contrary, followed the instructions of the trial court to\\n\\nconsider voluntary manslaughter before considering the felony\\n\\nmurder charge.” (citations and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     Because the trial court’s response to the note was not incorrect\\n\\nand because the foreperson confirmed, during the return of the\\n\\nverdict and in response to the judge’s question, that the jury did in\\n\\nfact follow the court’s instructions, Van controls Appellant’s claim\\n\\nregarding the allegedly erroneous ordering of the charges on the\\n\\nverdict form. Appellant’s claim therefore fails. See Van, \\n294 Ga. at\\n\\n24\\n 467 (4) (holding that where the jury was properly instructed on the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, the State’s burden of proof, and the\\n\\npossible verdicts that could be returned, “[m]erely listing the\\n\\noffenses on the verdict form in order of malice murder, felony\\n\\nmurder, and voluntary manslaughter did not constitute reversible\\n\\nerror”).\\n\\n     3. In his final enumeration of error, Appellant argues that the\\n\\ntrial court violated both his right under Article I, Section I,\\n\\nParagraph XII of the Georgia Constitution to be present during the\\n\\ncriminal proceedings against him and his right under the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment of the United States Constitution to the effective\\n\\nassistance of counsel by receiving and responding to the jury note\\n\\noutside the presence of the parties and without consulting counsel\\n\\nregarding the court’s response. Because we agree that the trial court\\n\\nmishandled its response to the jury note, we assume without\\n\\ndeciding that the trial court violated Appellant’s right to counsel\\n\\nunder the United States Constitution and his right to be present\\n\\nunder the Georgia Constitution. We nevertheless conclude, however,\\n\\n                                 25\\n that the court’s assumed violation of Appellant’s right to counsel was\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt and that the rebuttable\\n\\npresumption of harm arising from the court’s assumed violation of\\n\\nAppellant’s right to be present was overcome by the evidence, as\\n\\nexplained further below.\\n\\n     (a) The parties did not become aware of the note described\\n\\nabove until after the trial court dismissed the jury. After the jury\\n\\ndeparted, the trial court informed counsel for both parties that it\\n\\nhad received the note described above, explained its response, and\\n\\ngave the parties a chance to inspect the note, which was marked as\\n\\nCourt’s Exhibit 1 and entered into the record.\\n\\n     Appellant objected to the trial court’s communication with the\\n\\njury outside of the presence of the parties. Appellant also objected to\\n\\nthe trial court’s procedure insofar as it failed to notify the parties of\\n\\nthe note until after the jury was dismissed, thereby depriving\\n\\nAppellant of the chance to move timely for mistrial. Appellant\\n\\nnevertheless attempted to move for mistrial, which the trial court\\n\\ndenied before Appellant could state the grounds for his motion. The\\n\\n                                   26\\n trial judge then adjourned the trial and instructed the court reporter\\n\\nto stop transcribing the proceedings, even though Appellant’s\\n\\ncounsel was still attempting to articulate the grounds for his\\n\\nmotion. 4\\n\\n     (b) In Lowery v. State, \\n282 Ga. 68\\n (\\n646 SE2d 67\\n) (2007), we\\n\\nexercised our “inherent power” to announce a set of rules governing\\n\\njurors’ communications with the trial court (the “Lowery Rules”).\\n\\nLowery, \\n282 Ga. at 76\\n (4) (b) (ii). Under the Lowery Rules, trial\\n\\ncourts are required:\\n\\n        to have jurors’ communications submitted to the court\\n        in writing; to mark the written communication as a\\n        court exhibit in the presence of counsel; to afford\\n        counsel a full opportunity to suggest an appropriate\\n        response; and to make counsel aware of the substance\\n        of the trial court’s intended response in order that\\n        counsel may seek whatever modifications counsel\\n        deems appropriate before the jury is exposed to the\\n        instruction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 We do not condone the conduct of the trial court. The trial court violated\\n\\nthe procedures set forth in Lowery v. State, \\n282 Ga. 68\\n (\\n646 SE2d 67\\n) (2007),\\nand the court’s attempt to end the proceedings and close the record while\\ncounsel was still attempting to articulate the grounds for his motion for\\nmistrial was inappropriate.\\n                                      27\\n Id.\\n 5 The State does not dispute that the trial court failed to follow\\n\\nthese procedures.\\n\\n     Though we have applied harmless error analysis to claims\\n\\narising from a trial court’s failure to follow the Lowery Rules, see\\n\\ne.g., Styles v. State, \\n309 Ga. 463\\n, 469 (3) (\\n847 SE2d 325\\n) (2020);\\n\\nGrant v. State, \\n295 Ga. 126\\n, 129 (4) (\\n757 SE2d 831\\n) (2014), we have\\n\\napplied heightened standards of review where an appellant asserts\\n\\nthat the trial court violated a constitutional right in the course of a\\n\\nLowery violation. Where, as here, an appellant argues that a trial\\n\\ncourt violated his right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment by failing to follow the Lowery Rules, we have applied\\n\\nfederal precedent requiring the State to show that any such error is\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Lowery, \\n282 Ga. at 75-76\\n\\n\\n(4) (b) (ii) (citing Chapman v. California, \\n386 U.S. 18\\n, 24 (III) (87\\n\\nSCt 824, 17 LE2d 705) (1967)). See also Muse v. State, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n,\\n\\n\\n     5 As we noted in Styles v. State, \\n309 Ga. 463\\n (\\n847 SE2d 325\\n) (2020),\\n\\n“[s]ome of us have questions as to the propriety of our unilateral\\npronouncement of a new rule of procedure in Lowery, rather than through the\\nrule-making process established by the Georgia Constitution.” Styles, 309 Ga.\\nat 469 (3) n.6.\\n                                     28\\n 657-658 (5) (c) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023) (citing Lowery and applying a\\n\\nconstitutional harm standard).\\n\\n     Where, however, an appellant raises a right-to-be-present\\n\\nclaim under the Georgia Constitution regarding substantive\\n\\ncommunications between the court and the jury during its\\n\\ndeliberations outside the parties’ presence, we have instead applied\\n\\na rebuttable-presumption-of-harm standard. See Hanifa v. State,\\n\\n269 Ga. 797\\n, 807 (6) (\\n505 SE2d 731\\n) (1998) (stating that “unless the\\n\\ncharacter of the communication” between the court and the jury\\n\\n“clearly shows that it could not have been prejudicial to the accused,\\n\\nthe presumption of law would be that it was prejudicial” (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)), disapproved of on other grounds by Clark\\n\\nv. State, \\n315 Ga. 423\\n (\\n883 SE2d 317\\n) (2023). See also Fuller v. State,\\n\\n277 Ga. 505\\n, 506 (2) (\\n591 SE2d 782\\n) (2004) (quoting Hanifa, \\n269 Ga.\\n\\nat 807\\n (6)); Waldrip v. State, \\n266 Ga. 874\\n, 878-879 (2) (\\n471 SE2d 857\\n)\\n\\n(1996) (holding that the presumption of error that arose from the\\n\\ntrial judge eating lunch with the sequestered jury was overcome and\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 29\\n that the error was harmless).6\\n\\n      (c) It is undisputed that the trial court failed to follow the\\n\\nLowery Rules. Nevertheless, Appellant’s claims fail. Assuming\\n\\nwithout deciding that the trial court’s receipt of and response to the\\n\\njury note outside the presence of Appellant and his counsel violated\\n\\nAppellant’s right to be present under the Georgia Constitution and\\n\\nhis right to effective assistance of counsel under the United States\\n\\nConstitution, these errors were harmless under the applicable\\n\\nstandards of review explained above.\\n\\n\\n      6 As we explained at length in Champ v. State, \\n310 Ga. 832\\n (\\n854 SE2d\\n\\n706\\n) (2021), we have been inconsistent regarding whether the presumption of\\nharm arising from a violation of the defendant’s right to be present is\\nrebuttable. See Champ, 310 Ga. at 845 (2) (c) n.10. There, we noted that while\\nGeorgia courts “began saying more consistently and squarely that violations of\\nthe Georgia Constitution’s right to be present are not subject to harmless error\\nanalysis” by the late 1990s, “this Court and the Court of Appeals have\\ncontinued to treat one type of right-to-be-present violation — communications\\nbetween trial courts and jurors without the defendant present — as subject to\\na rebuttable presumption of prejudice.” Id. We further stated that “[i]t is not\\nclear . . . whether the automatic-reversal position . . . is the correct rule for all\\ncases, for certain categories of cases, or for no cases. We would be amenable to\\nreconsidering our recent holdings in a case in which the issue is fully briefed.”\\nId. Here, Appellant cites Hanifa and Carter for the proposition that a\\nrebuttable presumption of harm applies. Because Appellant does not ask us to\\nreconsider these cases or to otherwise resolve our caselaw regarding whether\\nthe presumption of harm is rebuttable, we decline to do so here. But, as we said\\nin Champ, id., we remain amenable to such arguments if properly raised in a\\nfuture case.\\n                                         30\\n      (i) We turn first to Appellant’s right-to-counsel claim. The\\n\\nassumed violation of Appellant’s right to counsel arose from the trial\\n\\ncourt’s response to the jury note outside the presence of counsel.\\n\\nThat note concerned the mechanical process of completing the\\n\\nverdict form, rather than the law regarding the charges presented.\\n\\nAnd the trial court’s response — which directed the jury to leave\\n\\nblank the portion of the verdict form corresponding to voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter if it found the defendant guilty of felony murder —\\n\\nconcerned that same mechanical process.\\n\\n     By responding to the jury without consulting counsel, the trial\\n\\ncourt deprived Appellant of the opportunity to inspect the note, to\\n\\noffer a proposed response, or to object to the trial court’s response.\\n\\nSee Phillips v. Harmon, \\n297 Ga. 386\\n, 392-393 (I) (B) (\\n774 SE2d 596\\n)\\n\\n(2015) (explaining the consequences of a court’s failure to disclose a\\n\\njury note to the parties and their counsel). We have already\\n\\nconcluded, however, that in the context of the instructions as a\\n\\nwhole, the court’s substantive response to the jury’s note was not\\n\\nincorrect and was within the trial court’s discretion. See Division 2\\n\\n                                 31\\n (b) (ii), supra. It is therefore unclear what guidance, if any,\\n\\nAppellant or Appellant’s trial counsel could have provided the court\\n\\nwith respect to its response that would have altered the outcome of\\n\\nthe proceedings, and Appellant does not propose any such guidance\\n\\non appeal. We also consider that though the trial court did not\\n\\ndisclose the note until after it dismissed the jury, it did ultimately\\n\\ninform counsel. This disclosure permitted Appellant’s counsel to\\n\\nrequest that the note be made a part of the record and to object to\\n\\nthe court’s procedure. Though the court did not permit Appellant’s\\n\\ncounsel to articulate the grounds of his motion for mistrial, the\\n\\ncourt’s disclosure ensured that Appellant could litigate the\\n\\ncorrectness of the trial court’s response at the motion for new trial\\n\\nand on appeal, as he did. Each of these considerations leads us to\\n\\nthe conclusion that this assumed error was harmless. Compare\\n\\nPhillips, \\n297 Ga. at 393\\n (I) (B) (concluding there was harmful error\\n\\nwhere the jury’s note was not preserved and differing recollections\\n\\nof the timing of the note meant that the plaintiffs were unable to\\n\\nlitigate whether the trial court properly responded to the note).\\n\\n                                 32\\n      Further, and more importantly, we have held that when the\\n\\njury has been charged on voluntary manslaughter and it “returns a\\n\\nverdict of malice murder, it, of necessity, finds that the defendant\\n\\ncommitted the homicide without the provocation sufficient to\\n\\nauthorize a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter.” Terry v.\\n\\nState, \\n263 Ga. 294\\n, 294 (1) (\\n430 SE2d 731\\n) (1993) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). See also Stanley v. State, \\n300 Ga. 587\\n, 591 (2)\\n\\n(\\n797 SE2d 98\\n) (2017) (same); Johnson v. State, \\n300 Ga. 665\\n, 668 (4)\\n\\n(a) (\\n797 SE2d 903\\n) (2017) (same); Dyal v. State \\n297 Ga. 184\\n, 187-188\\n\\n(4) (\\n773 SE2d 249\\n) (2015) (same). This is so because, as the court\\n\\ninstructed the jury, “[l]egal malice . . . is an unlawful intention to\\n\\nkill without justification, excuse, or mitigation.” (Emphasis\\n\\nsupplied.) See, e.g., Tessmer v. State, \\n273 Ga. 220\\n, 222 (2) (\\n539 SE2d\\n\\n816\\n) (2000) (“Malice means the intent to take a life without legal\\n\\njustification or mitigation.”); Bailey v. State, \\n70 Ga. 617\\n, 621 (2)\\n\\n(1883) (“[M]alice . . . . is an unlawful intention to kill, without\\n\\njustification, or mitigation.”). Thus it was the jury’s finding that\\n\\nAppellant killed his girlfriend with malice, rather than the\\n\\n                                 33\\n potentially faulty verdict form, that eliminated a determination that\\n\\nAppellant was guilty only of voluntary manslaughter. See Dyal, \\n297\\n\\nGa. at 188\\n (4). Cf. Swayzer, \\n263 Ga. 690\\n, 691 (1) (\\n436 SE2d 652\\n)\\n\\n(1993) (holding that because the jury found the defendant guilty of\\n\\nmalice murder, any error in giving an improperly sequential jury\\n\\ncharge   in   connection   with   felony   murder    and   voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter was harmless). We therefore conclude that the error\\n\\narising from the trial court’s assumed violation of Appellant’s right\\n\\nto counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States is\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n     (ii) Many of these same considerations affect our analysis of the\\n\\nharm that arose from the trial court’s assumed violation of\\n\\nAppellant’s right to be present. As stated above, we apply a\\n\\nrebuttable presumption of harm where the court engages in a\\n\\nsubstantive communication with the jury outside the presence of the\\n\\ndefendant. See Hanifa, \\n269 Ga. at 807\\n (6). Even where the\\n\\ncommunication is substantive, however, the presumption of harm\\n\\nthat arises may be overcome by evidence that the communication\\n\\n                                  34\\n did not affect the outcome of the trial. See Waldrip, \\n266 Ga. at\\n877-\\n\\n879 (2). In Waldrip, the trial court attended lunch with the jurors at\\n\\nthe hotel at which they were sequestered, outside the presence of\\n\\nthe defendant and his counsel. \\nId. at 877\\n (2). The judge later\\n\\ninformed the parties and explained that he and the jurors had\\n\\nengaged in “informal chitchat” unrelated to the case. \\nId.\\n Defense\\n\\ncounsel immediately moved for a mistrial, but his motion was\\n\\ndenied. \\nId.\\n After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the trial court\\n\\nquestioned each of the jurors on the record about his or her\\n\\nrecollection of this lunch. \\nId.\\n Though many of the jurors could not\\n\\nrecall their conversations with the judge or confirmed that they had\\n\\nengaged in only small talk, one of the jurors testified that he told the\\n\\njudge that if his wife and granddaughter were to come to the area,\\n\\nhe “might have to break the law” related to his sequestration. \\nId.\\n\\n\\nAccording to this juror, the trial judge responded that he “might do\\n\\nthe same thing” if he were in the juror’s position. \\nId. at 878\\n (2). The\\n\\njuror testified, however, that nothing the judge said or did affected\\n\\nhis decisions regarding the verdict. \\nId. at 878, 879\\n (2). Each other\\n\\n                                  35\\n juror testified to the same. \\nId. at 877\\n (2). Notwithstanding its\\n\\nrecognition that a presumption of harm arose from the judge’s ex\\n\\nparte communications with the jury, see \\nid. at 878\\n (2), the Waldrip\\n\\nCourt concluded that the error was harmless because each member\\n\\nof the jury confirmed that there was no effect upon the verdict. \\nId.\\n\\nat 879\\n (2).\\n\\n     Turning to Appellant’s case, the court’s communications with\\n\\nthe jurors were substantive insofar as they concerned the process of\\n\\ncompleting the verdict form, but we have already concluded that the\\n\\ncourt’s failure to consult with counsel was harmless beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt because this failure did not affect the outcome of\\n\\nthe trial. See Division 3 (c) (i), supra. As explained above, the court’s\\n\\nresponse to the note was not incorrect; the court acted within its\\n\\ndiscretion to forgo further instruction; and the jury considered\\n\\nevidence in mitigation but nevertheless found Appellant guilty of\\n\\nmalice murder. Two conclusions follow. First, like his trial counsel’s\\n\\nabsence,      Appellant’s   absence     during   the   Court’s   written\\n\\ncommunications with the jury did not affect the outcome of the trial.\\n\\n                                   36\\n Second, because these communications did not affect the outcome of\\n\\nthe trial, the presumption of harm from the assumed violation of\\n\\nAppellant’s right to be present was overcome. See Waldrip, \\n266 Ga.\\n\\nat 879\\n (2) (concluding that the presumption of harm arising from the\\n\\ndefendant’s involuntary absence during a discussion between the\\n\\ntrial judge and a juror regarding sequestration had been overcome\\n\\nbecause the discussion did not affect the outcome of the trial). As\\n\\nsuch, we conclude that the presumption of harm arising from the\\n\\ncourt’s assumed violation of Appellant’s right to be present is\\n\\nrebutted by the evidence.\\n\\n     This result is not inconsistent with our decision in Phillips v.\\n\\nHarmon because that case is distinguishable. See Phillips, \\n297 Ga.\\n\\nat 392-393\\n (I) (B). There, the trial court responded to multiple notes\\n\\noutside the presence of the parties and their counsel, and we\\n\\nconcluded that the trial court’s violation of the civil defendants’ right\\n\\nto be present was harmful. See Phillips, \\n297 Ga. 393\\n at (I) (B).\\n\\nAmong our reasons for concluding there was harm, we noted that\\n\\nthe jury notes were not disclosed to the plaintiffs until several weeks\\n\\n                                   37\\n after the trial, that the court had failed to preserve one of those notes\\n\\nfor the record, and that the judge and some of the jurors had\\n\\ndifferent recollections about the nature and timing of their\\n\\ncommunications. See \\nid.\\n Unlike Phillips, these circumstances are\\n\\nnot present here: the note was disclosed immediately after the jurors\\n\\nwere dismissed, the court preserved the note as part of the record,\\n\\nand there is no dispute about the timing of the judge’s\\n\\ncorrespondence with the jury. Perhaps most importantly, we further\\n\\nstated in Phillips that “the inability to make a determination that a\\n\\nverdict for the Defendants was demanded, regardless of any effect of\\n\\nthe communication on the jury, support[s] Plaintiffs’ entitlement to\\n\\na new trial.” \\nId.\\n Here, we have made an opposite conclusion: a\\n\\nverdict for the State on voluntary manslaughter was demanded by\\n\\nthe jury’s determination, regardless of the court’s response to the\\n\\nnote, given the foreperson’s confirmation that the jury considered\\n\\nevidence in mitigation and the jury’s finding that Appellant\\n\\ncommitted malice murder. As such, it is appropriate to reach a\\n\\ndifferent result here.\\n\\n                                   38\\n Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                           39\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9501676/mayo-v-state/'}),\n",

WARD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n        LAGRUA, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant James Graham Ward appeals his convictions for\\n\\nfelony murder and other crimes related to two shootings that\\n\\noccurred on March 24, 2021—one of which resulted in the death of\\n\\nBrian Belin. 1 Ward contends on appeal that (1) the trial court erred\\n\\n\\n        1 On August 4, 2021, a Paulding County grand jury indicted Ward for the\\n\\nfollowing counts: malice murder of Belin (Count 1); felony murder predicated\\non aggravated assault of Belin (Count 2); aggravated assault of Belin (Count\\n3); aggravated assault of Shadeja Rutledge (Count 4); aggravated assault of\\nJewell Porter (Count 5); aggravated assault of Russell Jones (Count 6); and\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (Count 7). The grand\\njury also indicted Ward and his co-defendant Annias Brooks—individually and\\nas parties concerned in the commission of a crime—for the following counts:\\naggravated assault of Belin (Count 8); aggravated assault of Rutledge (Count\\n9); aggravated assault of Porter (Count 10); aggravated assault of Jones (Count\\n11); and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony—\\nspecifically, the aggravated assault of Rutledge (Count 12). Ward and Brooks\\nwere jointly tried from March 14 to March 23, 2022. At trial, the jury found\\nWard guilty on Counts 2, 3, 7, 8, and 12 and not guilty on the remaining counts.\\nThe jury found Brooks not guilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced Ward\\nto life in prison without the possibility of parole on the felony murder count\\n(Count 2), plus a total of 20 consecutive years to serve for Counts 7, 8, and 12.\\nThe aggravated assault count (Count 3) merged with the felony murder count\\n in denying his request to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nbecause there was “some evidence” to support such a charge; (2) the\\n\\ntrial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on\\n\\nCount 8 (aggravated assault) and Count 12 (possession of a firearm\\n\\nduring the commission of a felony) because those counts were not\\n\\nsupported by the evidence and because his convictions on those\\n\\ncounts constituted repugnant verdicts since he was acquitted of the\\n\\nother aggravated assault charges based on the same conduct; and\\n\\n(3) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by agreeing to\\n\\nthe trial court’s ruling on the State’s motion in limine and by failing\\n\\nto file a “reverse 404 (b) motion” under OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) related\\n\\nto Belin’s propensity to carry firearms because this evidence was\\n\\nrelevant to Ward’s self-defense claim and prejudiced his ability to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Count 2) for sentencing purposes. Ward filed a timely motion for new trial,\\nwhich he later amended through new counsel on January 9, 2023 and April 17,\\n2023. After holding an evidentiary hearing on the motion for new trial, the trial\\ncourt denied the motion on August 21, 2023. Ward filed a timely notice of\\nappeal to this Court on September 8, 2023, and the case was docketed to the\\nDecember 2024 term of this Court and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                      2\\n support this defense at trial. Seeing no merit to these claims, we\\n\\naffirm Ward’s convictions.\\n\\n     The evidence presented at Ward’s trial, viewed in the light\\n\\nmost favorable to the verdicts, showed that, prior to the shootings\\n\\non March 24, 2021, Belin was spending the evening with his\\n\\ngirlfriend, Shadeja Rutledge, and a few friends. Rutledge, who\\n\\nstarted dating Belin in 2020, had previously been in an “on-\\n\\nagain/off-again” sexual relationship with Ward, which Ward\\n\\ndescribed as “friends with benefits.” Several months after Belin and\\n\\nRutledge started dating, Belin was incarcerated, and during that\\n\\ntimeframe, Rutledge and Ward saw each other again—but no more\\n\\nthan “once or twice.” When Belin was released from jail, he and\\n\\nRutledge resumed their relationship.\\n\\n     On the evening of March 24, Belin and Rutledge went to the\\n\\nhome of Russell Jones, a “close friend” of Belin’s, who lived with his\\n\\nparents in the Regency Park subdivision. Belin, Rutledge, and Jones\\n\\n“decided [they] were going to chill at [Jones’s] house” that night to\\n\\n                                  3\\n “drink and play music.” The group left the house briefly to purchase\\n\\nliquor and pick up Rutledge’s friend, Anisa Karim, and then\\n\\nreturned to Jones’s house. They were later joined by Jones’s\\n\\ngirlfriend, Jewell Porter. Around 8:00 p.m., Jones’s parents came\\n\\nhome, and his mother told the group to leave. According to Jones, he\\n\\nhad previously gotten into trouble with his parents because Porter\\n\\n“was caught spending the night,” and he was not allowed to have\\n\\ncompany at the house.\\n\\n     The group got into Belin’s car. Belin drove to the common area\\n\\nof the subdivision—an area next to the entrance of the subdivision\\n\\nwhere the swimming pool and tennis courts are located—and he\\n\\nparked the car. Jones was very angry about being forced to leave his\\n\\nhouse, and he and Belin got out of the car while Belin tried to calm\\n\\nJones down. Belin and Jones talked outside the car for about 10 or\\n\\n15 minutes, and then, the two men started walking along a paved\\n\\npath leading from the common area to other homes in the\\n\\nsubdivision. Rutledge, Karim, and Porter stayed in the car, listening\\n\\n                                 4\\n to music and talking. Rutledge testified that she did not see Belin\\n\\nand Jones walk away from the car, and according to Porter, she\\n\\n“los[t] sight” of where the men went.\\n\\n      As Belin and Jones were walking along the path, Jones heard\\n\\n“a [woman]’s voice coming from [a] house” adjacent to the common\\n\\narea, and Jones realized it was Ward’s house.2 Jones testified that\\n\\nhe and Belin did not intentionally walk to Ward’s house; they were\\n\\n“just walking and talking” when they heard a woman’s voice and\\n\\nsaw several people outside on the deck of the house, “playing music\\n\\nand stuff.” Jones and Belin approached the fence running along the\\n\\nbackyard of the house, and Belin asked the woman if Ward was\\n\\nhome. She said Ward was not there. Jones testified that “a lot of\\n\\npeople” from the house then came over to the fence and “started\\n\\ngetting rowdy” and “making threats.”\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 The record reflects that, on March 24, 2021, Ward’s mother, Stacy\\nMason, rented a house in the Regency Park subdivision, which backs up to the\\ntennis courts and swimming pool in the common area. Mason testified that\\nseveral of her children and her husband’s children lived with her in this house,\\nincluding Ward and his co-defendant Brooks.\\n                                      5\\n      Rutledge, Karim, and Porter—who were still sitting in Belin’s\\n\\ncar—heard “some noise” and “someone screaming,” so they got out\\n\\nof the car and followed the path until they came upon Belin and\\n\\nJones “arguing” and “talking to some dudes over the fence.” Rutledge\\n\\ntestified that she was concerned because Belin was “on probation”\\n\\nand was “extremely drunk,” so she grabbed his hand and told him to\\n\\ncome back to the car. Belin followed Rutledge towards the common\\n\\narea, but the rest of the group stayed at the fence. Jones testified\\n\\nthat he was “still arguing” with the people on the other side of the\\n\\nfence, and Porter was telling him, “[L]et’s go.” Jones testified that\\n\\nhe did not “trust the situation, so he didn’t “want to turn [his] back”\\n\\nand walk away.\\n\\n     Ward’s mother, Stacy Mason, testified that she was sitting in\\n\\nher bedroom talking to Ward on the evening of March 24 when it\\n\\n“came to [her] attention that something was going on outside of her\\n\\nhouse.” Mason testified that Ward “got a phone call” around that\\n\\ntime, and he answered the phone, “shook his head,” and “went out\\n\\n                                  6\\n of the room.” Ward and Mason went downstairs, at which point\\n\\nWard exited “out the front door and [Mason] went out the back door”\\n\\nonto the deck. Mason testified that “[t]here was a lot of yelling over\\n\\n[their] fence,” and “it was commotion just all in back of the fence.”\\n\\nMason said the people on the other side of the fence were “calling\\n\\nfor” Ward, and she told them to leave.\\n\\n     Rutledge testified that, when she and Belin got back to the\\n\\nparking lot in the common area, “a car pull[ed] up, and [Ward]\\n\\nhop[ped] out.” Ward approached Rutledge and Belin and “ask[ed] is\\n\\nthere a problem,” and she responded, “No. There ain’t no problem.”\\n\\nWard then started shooting at Belin. Porter testified that she saw\\n\\n“someone come running up” to Belin and Rutledge in the parking lot\\n\\nof the common area and heard “shots go off.” Porter said she could\\n\\nnot identify the person who was shooting, but she saw the person\\n\\n“pointing at” Belin and saw Belin “go to the ground.” Karim also\\n\\ntestified that, while she was standing by Ward’s backyard, she heard\\n\\nwhat she thought were “fireworks,” and when she turned around,\\n\\n                                  7\\n she saw “someone shoot at someone and then quickly run away.” She\\n\\ncould not see who the shooter was, but she heard Rutledge\\n\\nscreaming and yelling Ward’s name “over and over again.” Ward’s\\n\\nsister, Amyris Avritte, testified that she was outside their home on\\n\\nthe evening of March 24while an argument was going on at their\\n\\nbackyard fence, and she saw a car pull into the common area and\\n\\n“heard shots.”3 Mason also testified to seeing a “dark car” pull into\\n\\nthe common area parking lot and to hearing gunshots “over in the\\n\\nparking lot area.”4\\n\\n     According to Rutledge, after Ward shot Belin, she ran to grab\\n\\nher phone out of Belin’s car to call 911, at which point a second round\\n\\nof shots—which she assumed were intended for her—were fired.\\n\\nPorter and Jones testified that they also heard a second round of\\n\\n“shots pointed [their] way,” and Porter realized she had been struck\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 Avritte testified that she did not see Ward that night.\\n     4 According to Mason, Ward did not have a gun on him while he was in\\n\\nher bedroom that night and, “to [her] knowledge,” did not own a gun.\\n                                       8\\n with a bullet.” 5 Karim similarly testified that, moments after the\\n\\nfirst shooting, she heard “shots go again,” so she “duck[ed],” “roll[ed]\\n\\nover,” and hid behind some bushes by the tennis courts.\\n\\n     Jones testified that, after Porter was struck, he picked her up\\n\\nto carry her back to the common area, and as he was doing so, he\\n\\nsaw “Ward “hop into” a car, which went “peeling off” away from the\\n\\ncommon area and “out [of] the neighborhood.” Rutledge also testified\\n\\nthat she saw Ward “hop back into [a] car” in the common area, and\\n\\nKarim said she saw “a dark gray or a black van” in the common area\\n\\n“during the second shooting.”\\n\\n     Rutledge and Karim called 911,6 while Jones attended to Belin.\\n\\nJones “took up [Belin’s] shirt,” saw “bullet wounds and blood\\n\\nsquirting out,” and tried to “do CPR and pump [Belin’s] chest.”\\n\\nRutledge and Jones testified that Belin did not have a gun on him\\n\\nthat night and that they did not know him to ever “carry a gun.”\\n\\n\\n     5 Jones testified that a bullet “grazed” Porter’s back.\\n     6 Recordings of the 911 calls were played for the jury at trial.   During the\\nphone calls, Rutledge and Karim identified Ward as the shooter.\\n                                     9\\n       Ronnie and Janelle Scogin, who lived in the Regency Park\\n\\nsubdivision, 7 were at home around 8:30 p.m. on March 24 when they\\n\\nheard “seven or eight bangs” that sounded like “gunshots.” The\\n\\nScoginses stepped outside and “could hear young women crying\\n\\nreally, really loud” and screaming for help. Ronnie hurried “towards\\n\\nthe [common] area where [he] heard them crying,” and “as [he] got\\n\\nto the sidewalk, . . . [he] saw a guy get in a silver SUV and then come\\n\\ndown the road at a high rate of speed.” Ronnie next saw a “black\\n\\nSUV Ford Explorer with New York plates” drive up “right behind”\\n\\nthe silver SUV, 8 “heard several more shots,” and saw the black SUV\\n\\nleave the subdivision, followed by the silver SUV “maybe a minute”\\n\\nlater. Ronnie ran back to the house and yelled for Janelle to call 911.\\n\\nJanelle called 911 and advised the operator that there had been a\\n\\nshooting and that a black SUV with New York plates involved in\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 The Scoginses’ house was located a few houses away from the common\\n\\narea, between the house where Ward lived and the entrance to the subdivision.\\n      8 Mason testified that, during this timeframe, she was renting a silver or\\n\\ngray Nissan Pathfinder that Brooks was driving on March 24, and Ward was\\nrenting and driving a black Ford Explorer.\\n                                       10\\n that shooting was driving out of the subdivision. The Scoginses had\\n\\na motion-sensitive video camera installed on the front of their house,\\n\\nfacing the street, which recorded the events of March 24. The video\\n\\nfootage from the camera, which was played for the jury at trial,\\n\\ncaptured the sounds of multiple gunshots and screaming, followed\\n\\nby images of a black Ford Explorer and a silver Nissan Pathfinder\\n\\ndriving towards the common area, the sound of more gunshots, and\\n\\nimages of a black Ford Explorer and a silver Nissan Pathfinder\\n\\ndriving away from the common area and out of the subdivision on\\n\\nthe night of March 24. The Scoginses shared this video with the law\\n\\nenforcement officers investigating the case.\\n\\n        Around 8:30 p.m. on March 24, law enforcement officers with\\n\\nthe Paulding County Sheriff’s Office received a call regarding a\\n\\nhomicide in the common area of the Regency Park subdivision.\\n\\nDetective Jacob Martin, one of the first responding officers, testified\\n\\nthat:\\n\\n        [o]nce I arrived on the scene, a female identified as\\n        Shadeja Rutledge ran down the hill screaming and saying\\n                                  11\\n      that her boyfriend had been shot in the head and he is\\n     dying. I ran up the hill area at the tennis courts and I\\n     observed that there was a male lying on the ground and\\n     he was bleeding with shell casings around him and\\n     appeared to be lifeless. A male identified as ‘Russell\\n     Jones’ was on top of him trying to give CPR. I observed\\n     two other females on the side.\\n\\n     Emergency medical services soon arrived and “attempted to\\n\\nrender aid” to Belin, but he was deceased. The medical examiner\\n\\ntestified that Belin sustained a total of four gunshot wounds—one\\n\\nin “the anterior upper chest,” one in “the right side of the lower\\n\\nabdomen,” one in “the left side of the head,” and one in “the left side\\n\\nof the back”—as well as “shrapnel injuries” in his left hand.\\n\\nAccording to the medical examiner, “each one of the gunshot wounds\\n\\nin and of themselves would have been fatal,” but “the collective of all\\n\\nof them [was] what led to [Belin’s] death.”\\n\\n     Detective Gregory Pauch, a crime scene technician, testified\\n\\nthat he collected 9mm shell casings from around Belin’s body, “in\\n\\nthe vicinity of the tennis courts,” and in the roadway. Detective\\n\\nPauch testified that some of the 9mm shell casings he discovered\\n\\n                                  12\\n were aluminum or metal, while others were brass, which led\\n\\ninvestigators to believe that two guns might be involved. At trial,\\n\\nthe GBI firearms examiner testified that, after examining the shell\\n\\ncasings recovered during the autopsy and the shell casings collected\\n\\nfrom the crime scene area, she was able to establish that all the shell\\n\\ncasings were fired from Smith & Wesson 9mm pistols. However, the\\n\\nshell casings located inside and around the victim’s body and in the\\n\\ncommon area, and the shell casings located in the roadway were\\n\\nfired from two different firearms. No weapons were found on the\\n\\nscene, and neither the murder weapon nor any other weapon\\n\\ninvolved in the shootings was ever recovered by law enforcement.\\n\\n     Law enforcement officers learned that Ward was driving a\\n\\nblack Ford Explorer with New York plates on the night of the\\n\\nshooting. During the early morning hours of March 25, law\\n\\nenforcement officers located Ward and co-defendant Brooks at the\\n\\nhome of Shayla George, and Ward was arrested and taken into\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  13\\n custody.9 While he was in custody, Ward was swabbed for the\\n\\npresence of gunshot residue (“GSR”). At trial, Kimberly Jewett, a\\n\\nGBI expert in microanalysis, testified that GSR testing revealed\\n\\n“four particles characteristic of gunshot primer residue” on Ward’s\\n\\nhands, which meant that “either he discharged a firearm or he was\\n\\nin the presence of a discharging firearm or he came into contact with\\n\\nan item whose surface bears GSR[,] which would be like a recently\\n\\ndischarged firearm.”\\n\\n     Shortly after Ward’s arrest, law enforcement officers obtained\\n\\nand executed a search warrant at George’s residence, and during\\n\\ntheir search, they located Brooks’s cell phone, as well as a gray or\\n\\nsilver Nissan Pathfinder parked inside the garage. George testified\\n\\nthat Brooks drove the Pathfinder to her house on the night of March\\n\\n24, and at some point during the night, he moved the vehicle into\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     9  At that time, Brooks was not a suspect in the shootings. When\\nDetective Dickson later interviewed Brooks about the events of March 24,\\nDetective Dickson came to suspect that Brooks was a second shooter and took\\nhim into custody during the interview.\\n                                     14\\n the garage.10 George also testified that Ward arrived at her house\\n\\nabout “an hour and 45 minutes” after Brooks, but she did not know\\n\\nhow Ward got there.\\n\\n     On the morning of March 25, law enforcement officers located\\n\\nWard’s Ford Explorer at a local park. After obtaining a search\\n\\nwarrant for the Ford Explorer and removing its computer system—\\n\\nfrom which geolocation data was subsequently downloaded— law\\n\\nenforcement officers found a black handgun holster in the pocket\\n\\nbehind the driver’s seat, as well as personal items belonging to\\n\\nWard, including Ward’s driver’s license. Law enforcement officers\\n\\nalso swabbed the interior and exterior of the Ford Explorer to test\\n\\nfor the presence of GSR, which testing revealed “four particles of\\n\\ngunshot primer residue” on the driver’s side panel and steering\\n\\nwheel of the vehicle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     10 Mason testified that she spoke to Brooks by phone on the night of the\\n\\nshootings, and she told him to park the Pathfinder in the garage at George’s\\nhouse because it was “linked” to Mason as the renter of the vehicle.\\n                                     15\\n      On March 30, 2021, law enforcement officers executed a search\\n\\nwarrant at Ward’s residence and located Ward’s cell phone. Law\\n\\nenforcement officers then obtained search warrants for the cell\\n\\nphones of Ward, Brooks, and Mason. Detective Tyler Brown, who\\n\\nwas admitted as an expert in geolocation analysis and forensic\\n\\nanalysis of electronic data at trial, testified that he reviewed and\\n\\nanalyzed the cell phone records in this case, as well as the\\n\\ngeolocation data taken from the Ford Explorer. Detective Brown\\n\\ntestified that the recovered data showed that, during certain periods\\n\\nof time, Ward’s cell phone and the Ford Explorer were “synced up\\n\\nto” one another. According to Detective Brown, the data recovered\\n\\nfrom Ward’s cell phone and the Ford Explorer also demonstrated\\n\\nthat, between approximately 8:20 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on the night of\\n\\nthe shootings, Ward’s cell phone and the Ford Explorer were\\n\\npositioned and traveled as follows: (1) the cell phone and vehicle\\n\\nwere first located near Ward’s residence; (2) the car and phone\\n\\ntraveled near the parking lot of the common area by the tennis\\n\\n                                 16\\n courts, but did not remain in one spot; (3) the car and phone left the\\n\\nvicinity of the parking lot and common area—traveling out of the\\n\\ncrime scene area and in the direction of the back of the subdivision;\\n\\n(4) the car and phone traveled near the common area and the\\n\\nentrance of the subdivision, “paused briefly,” and then traveled in\\n\\nthe direction of the exit of the subdivision; (5) the car and phone\\n\\ntraveled near the area around the park where Ward’s Ford Explorer\\n\\nwas located, after which there was “no more data for the Ford\\n\\nExplorer”; and (6) the cell phone then traveled near the northern\\n\\npart of Paulding County. Detective Brown testified that, about 15 to\\n\\n20 minutes after the shooting, Ward’s cell phone “didn’t\\n\\ncommunicate anymore, and it wasn’t used.” Additionally, Detective\\n\\nBrown noted that ten calls were exchanged between Mason and\\n\\nWard between 8:30 and 8:45 p.m. on March 24, and 27 calls were\\n\\nexchanged between Mason and Brooks during the same timeframe.\\n\\n     Ward testified in his own defense at trial. According to Ward,\\n\\non the evening of March 24, he had just “pull[ed] in the driveway” of\\n\\n                                 17\\n his house and had “run in” to “grab something out of [his] room” and\\n\\nthen “leave again,” when Avritte—who was outside in the\\n\\nbackyard—called him on the phone. Ward was inside talking to\\n\\nMason at the time, and Avritte said, “There’s people out here asking\\n\\nfor you and they’re cursing or whatever.” Ward said he did not think\\n\\nit was anything serious—he assumed it was “some of her little\\n\\nfriends”—but he decided he would drive over to the common area,\\n\\n“see what’s going on,” and try to diffuse the situation. Ward testified\\n\\nthat he got in his car and “went to the parking lot” by the common\\n\\narea, where he thought “it was going to be like a little situation with\\n\\nthe kids that my siblings went to school with or whatever.”\\n\\n     According to Ward, when he got to the parking lot, the\\n\\nfollowing occurred:\\n\\n     I went and I got out of the car and walked up the path—\\n     and started walking up the path and then I seen Mr. Belin\\n     and Ms. Rutledge and then I was just like—like, basically,\\n     I just asked him like, What’s going on—or basically,\\n     What’s your problem or whatever, and then he didn’t\\n     really say nothing. He was like, Who’s that and walked\\n     closer, and then he just lunged at me and hit me with the\\n     gun.\\n                                  18\\n Ward testified that, after “Belin came at [him]” and “hit him with\\n\\nthe gun,” they “tussled for like maybe 15 seconds.” Ward said he\\n\\nwas not armed, but he “took the gun from” Belin, and then Belin\\n\\n“backed up maybe like five or 6 feet and then he just lunged at\\n\\n[Ward] again and that’s when [Ward] shot him.” Ward testified that\\n\\nhe did not “have any intentions of fighting anybody,” and he was just\\n\\n“defending” himself.\\n\\n     When Ward’s trial counsel asked why several shots were fired,\\n\\nWard responded that he was “scared for [his] life,” so he “just shot\\n\\nuntil [Belin] dropped.” After shooting Belin, Ward said he “dropped\\n\\nthe gun and ran and hopped in [his] car and left.” Ward testified that\\n\\nhe thought about going back to his house, but he knew his “family\\n\\n[wa]s not going to be safe,” so he “left the neighborhood” and went to\\n\\nthe “courts at Ben Hill Park.” Ward said he left his Ford Explorer at\\n\\nthe park because he was “too shaken up to drive” and “asked a friend\\n\\nto drop [him] off” at George’s house. Ward recalled leaving his wallet\\n\\n\\n                                 19\\n and driver’s license inside the Explorer, but testified that he did not\\n\\nknow a gun holster was also in the vehicle.\\n\\n     On cross examination, Ward testified that he was “justified” in\\n\\nshooting Belin “because it was self-defense.” Ward insisted that he\\n\\nwas not in “like a heat of passion” nor had he “lost his control or\\n\\nanything.” Ward said, “[I]t was him or me,” and he “had to” shoot\\n\\nBelin. According to Ward, he was not sure where he shot Belin\\n\\nbecause he “didn’t really look.” Ward believed he shot Belin in the\\n\\nchest and “didn’t know anything” about the shots to Belin’s back,\\n\\nstomach, or head. Ward said he just “pulled the trigger” multiple\\n\\ntimes, acknowledging that he was responsible for shooting and\\n\\nkilling Belin, but emphasizing that he shot Belin in “self-defense.”\\n\\nWard testified that he was aware that—other than his trial\\n\\ntestimony—no other evidence or testimony had been presented to\\n\\nshow that Belin was armed on the night of the shootings.\\n\\n     As for the second shooting on the night of March 24, Ward\\n\\ntestified that he was not present, he “didn’t shoot at nobody,” and he\\n\\n                                  20\\n was not the one who shot Porter in the back. Ward admitted that\\n\\nthe video recording from the Scoginses’ house showed a black Ford\\n\\nExplorer driving towards the common area “right before the second\\n\\nshots” were heard and that he could hear the “second volley of\\n\\ngunshots” on the video. However, Ward insisted that he was “not\\n\\nthere at the time of the second shooting.”\\n\\n     1. On appeal, Ward contends that the trial court erred in\\n\\nfailing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, see OCGA §\\n\\n16-5-2 (a), 11 because his trial testimony constituted sufficient\\n\\nevidence of provocation for the issue of voluntary manslaughter to\\n\\nhave been charged to the jury. We see no merit to this claim because\\n\\nthere was not even slight evidence presented to support this charge.\\n\\nSee Smith v. State, \\n296 Ga. 731\\n, 737 (3) (\\n770 SE2d 610\\n) (2015) (“As\\n\\n\\n    11 OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) states, in pertinent part, that\\n\\n\\n\\n     [a] person commits the offense of voluntary manslaughter when he\\n     causes the death of another human being under circumstances\\n     which would otherwise be murder and if he acts solely as the result\\n     of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious\\n     provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable\\n     person[.]\\n                                       21\\n the evidence in this case does not rise to a level sufficient to support\\n\\na voluntary manslaughter charge, the trial court did not err in\\n\\nrefusing to give the charge requested.”).\\n\\n     At trial, Ward submitted a written request to charge the jury\\n\\non voluntary manslaughter. At the close of the evidence, the trial\\n\\ncourt held a charge conference and advised the parties that it would\\n\\nnot give the voluntary manslaughter charge because Ward’s trial\\n\\ntestimony demonstrated that he did not shoot Belin as the result of\\n\\n“serious provocation which was sufficient to excite [sudden] passion\\n\\nin a reasonable person.” The trial court did not charge the jury on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter, and Ward objected.\\n\\n     Later, in denying Ward’s motion for new trial alleging that the\\n\\ntrial court’s refusal to give this charge was error, the trial court\\n\\nrejected this claim, explaining that, to “merit a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge as a lesser included offense of malice murder\\n\\nor felony murder,” the evidence “must demonstrate the requisite\\n\\nprovocation.” The trial court determined that Ward failed to\\n\\n                                  22\\n demonstrate the “requisite provocation” at trial, and thus, the trial\\n\\ncourt properly denied Ward’s request for a charge on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. We agree.\\n\\n     If there is any evidence, however slight, to support a\\n     properly requested charge of voluntary manslaughter,\\n     then the trial court must give it. But a charge on\\n     voluntary manslaughter is warranted only where it can\\n     be shown that the accused was so influenced and excited\\n     that he reacted passionately rather than simply in an\\n     attempt to defend himself. A charge on voluntary\\n     manslaughter is not available to a defendant whose own\\n     statement unequivocally shows that he was not angered\\n     or impassioned when a killing occurred, and when the\\n     other evidence does not show otherwise.\\n\\nThompson v. State, \\n312 Ga. 254\\n, 257-258 (2) (\\n862 SE2d 317\\n) (2021)\\n\\n(quoting Beck v. State, \\n310 Ga. 491\\n, 496-497 (2) (\\n852 SE2d 535\\n)\\n\\n(2020)).\\n\\n     Here, there was not even slight evidence presented that could\\n\\nmeet this standard. At trial, Ward testified that, on the night of\\n\\nMarch 24, 2021, Belin was armed with a gun when Ward\\n\\nencountered him in the common area, and the two men “tussled”\\n\\nbefore the shooting occurred. Ward then testified      that he was\\n\\n                                 23\\n “justified” in shooting Belin “because it was self-defense,” and when\\n\\nasked on cross-examination whether he shot Belin in the “heat of\\n\\npassion” or whether he had “lost his control,” Ward plainly denied\\n\\nboth, insisting that “it was him or me” and that he shot Belin\\n\\nbecause he was “scared for [his] life.”\\n\\n      “This Court has repeatedly held that neither fear that\\n\\nsomeone is going to pull a gun nor fighting prior to a homicide are\\n\\ntypes of provocation demanding a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ncharge[,]” Funes v. State, \\n289 Ga. 793\\n, 795 (2) (\\n716 SE2d 183\\n) (2011),\\n\\nand Ward points to no evidence whatsoever of provocation other\\n\\nthan a tussle between him and Belin. “[A]cting out of fear is not the\\n\\nsame as acting in the heat of a sudden irresistible passion[,]” \\nid.,\\n\\n\\n“and only evidence of the latter supports a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nconviction.” Burke v. State, \\n302 Ga. 786\\n, 791 (2) (\\n809 SE2d 765\\n)\\n\\n(2018). See also Dugger v. State, \\n297 Ga. 120\\n, 123-124 (7) (\\n772 SE2d\\n\\n695\\n) (2015) (holding that, where the appellant claimed that he shot\\n\\nthe victim in self-defense, “not out of anger or other passion,” and\\n\\n                                  24\\n there was no other evidence supporting a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ncharge, such a charge was not warranted). For these reasons, we\\n\\nconclude there was “no error in the trial court’s failure to instruct\\n\\nthe jury that it might consider voluntary manslaughter.” \\nThompson,\\n\\n312\\n Ga. at 258 (2).\\n\\n     2. Ward next contends that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\nmotion for a directed verdict on the aggravated assault and\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony counts\\n\\nrelated to the second shooting because the evidence was insufficient\\n\\nto establish that he was present when that shooting occurred. The\\n\\nrecord reflects that Ward did not move for a directed verdict at trial,\\n\\nso this enumeration is without merit. However, even if Ward had\\n\\nmoved for a directed verdict, we disagree that the evidence was\\n\\ninsufficient to support Ward’s convictions for aggravated assault\\n\\nand possession of a firearm as a matter of constitutional due process.\\n\\n     Ward also argues that the verdict was repugnant because he\\n\\nwas acquitted of the other aggravated assault charges related to the\\n\\n                                  25\\n second shooting. We conclude that the verdict in this case was not\\n\\nrepugnant, see Rutland v. State, \\n315 Ga. 521\\n, 522 (1) (\\n883 SE2d 730\\n)\\n\\n(2023), and this claim also fails.\\n\\n     The standard of review for the denial of a motion for a\\n     directed verdict of acquittal is the same as for\\n     determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\\n     conviction. Under this review, we leave to the trier of fact\\n     the resolution of conflicts or inconsistencies in the\\n     evidence, credibility of witnesses, and reasonable\\n     inferences to be derived from the facts, we do not reweigh\\n     the evidence, and as long as there is some competent\\n     evidence, even though contradicted, to support each fact\\n     necessary to make out the State’s case, the jury’s verdict\\n     will be upheld.\\n\\nEllington v.

See \\nid.\\n\\n\\n     Accordingly, after properly viewing the evidence in the light\\n\\nmost favorable to the verdict, we conclude that the evidence was\\n\\nsufficient as a matter of constitutional due process for a jury to find\\n\\nWard guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of aggravated assault\\n\\nagainst Belin and possession of a firearm during the commission of\\n\\na felony against Rutledge. See Jackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n (III) (B).\\n\\nSee also Boyd v. State, \\n306 Ga. 204\\n, 207 (1) (\\n830 SE2d 160\\n) (2019).\\n\\n     Additionally, Ward’s claim that the verdicts rendered in this\\n\\ncase were repugnant is meritless. “‘Repugnant verdicts occur when,\\n\\nin order to find the defendant not guilty on one count and guilty on\\n\\nanother, the jury must make affirmative findings shown on the\\n\\nrecord that cannot logically or legally exist at the same time.”\\n\\nRutland, 315 Ga. at 522 (1) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\nHere, the jury’s verdicts were not repugnant. While the jury found\\n\\nWard not guilty of aggravated assault as to Rutledge but guilty of\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the aggravated assault of Rutledge,\\n\\n                                  29\\n these verdicts could “legally exist at the same time,” and the not\\n\\nguilty verdict does not require any specific findings by the jury. Id.\\n\\n     Instead, the jury’s verdicts were “inconsistent.” Rutland, 315\\n\\nGa. at 522 (1). “An example of ‘inconsistent verdicts’ is when a\\n\\ndefendant is convicted of possession of a firearm during the\\n\\ncommission of the crime of aggravated assault but found not guilty\\n\\nof aggravated assault.”    Id.   “Although this Court once viewed\\n\\ninconsistent verdicts as impermissible, this Court now allows\\n\\ninconsistent verdicts to stand,” because “it is not generally within\\n\\nthe court’s power to make inquiries into the jury’s deliberations, or\\n\\nto speculate about the reasons for any inconsistency between guilty\\n\\nand not guilty verdicts.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted). See\\n\\nalso Coleman, 286 Ga. at 295-296 (4) (concluding that, while the\\n\\nappellant “contends his conviction for possession of a firearm during\\n\\nthe commission of the crime of aggravated assault of [the victim]\\n\\ncannot stand in light of his acquittal of the underlying felony,”\\n\\nGeorgia has rejected the “inconsistent verdict rule,” and          an\\n\\n                                  30\\n appellant can no longer “attack as inconsistent a jury verdict of\\n\\nguilty on one count and not guilty on a different count”). As such,\\n\\nwe conclude that the jury’s verdicts on the aggravated assault of\\n\\nRutledge and possession of a firearm during the aggravated assault\\n\\nof Rutledge counts are permitted to stand.12\\n\\n         3. In Ward’s final contention, he asserts that his trial counsel\\n\\nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion under\\n\\nOCGA § 24-4-404 (b) to present “reverse 404 (b) evidence” related to\\n\\nBelin’s propensity to carry firearms and by failing to object to the\\n\\ntrial court’s pretrial ruling granting the State’s motion in limine\\n\\nregarding this issue.

The trial court held a pretrial hearing on the\\n\\nState’s motions in limine on the first morning of trial. During the\\n\\nhearing, the prosecutor explained that the primary focus of the\\n\\nState’s motion in limine was Belin’s incarceration from late 2020\\n\\nuntil early 2021, which the State anticipated would be addressed\\n\\nduring trial because Belin’s incarceration “impacted his relationship\\n\\nwith [Rutledge].” The prosecutor indicated that the State would\\n\\n“affirmatively” discuss the fact that Belin was “locked up,” but\\n\\nargued that the “general rule” still prevailed—i.e., “the character of\\n\\nwitnesses, including victims, [was] not relevant.” The prosecutor\\n\\nnoted that the defense had not provided any discovery to the State,\\n\\nsuch as certified copies of convictions or any other documents that\\n\\n“could be used for proper impeachment,” so the State believed that\\n\\n                                 34\\n “any bad character of witnesses, victims, any police officers” was “off\\n\\nlimits.”\\n\\n     In response, Ward’s trial counsel argued that the defense had\\n\\n     some [photographs] of [Belin] with guns and [Ward’s]\\n     defense [was] that Mr. Belin brought the gun to the party\\n     rather than [Ward], and [Ward] would like to use those\\n     [photographs] as evidence, not for character, but for\\n     propensity to carry a gun, and also the conviction for\\n     having a gun on school grounds. We believe it is relevant\\n     to our defense.13\\n\\nThe prosecutor responded that there had “not been any reverse\\n\\n[OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (“Rule 404 (b)”] notice,” and he believed “that\\n\\nwould be required if [the parties were] going to go into—or there’s\\n\\ngoing to be any attempt to make pertinent any specific instances of\\n\\nalleged prior acts.”\\n\\n     In ruling on the State’s motion in limine, the trial court agreed\\n\\nwith the State that this “type of evidence would require maybe a 404\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     13 The record reflects that Ward’s trial counsel did not show any of the\\n\\nphotographs or documentation pertaining to a gun-possession disposition to\\nthe trial court or the State during the pretrial hearing.\\n                                       35\\n (b) notice, which requires [the defense] to put the State on notice.”14\\n\\nThe trial court also observed that it did not “know what exactly the\\n\\nrelevance of that evidence would be at th[at] point” since Ward had\\n\\nnot included self-defense in the requests to charge he filed before\\n\\ntrial. The trial court granted the motion in limine, advising that,\\n\\n      [i]f during the course of this case, something comes to\\n      light or there does appear to be a reason to revisit this,\\n      the court is certainly open to doing so if that becomes\\n      necessary, but that needs to be done outside the presence\\n      of the jury and [the parties] need to notify the court that\\n      [they] intend to do it prior to any attempts or any\\n      references to that.\\n\\nAt trial, Ward did not raise the issue of introducing any photographs\\n\\nor convictions of Belin as evidence.\\n\\n      In his motion for new trial, Ward contended that his trial\\n\\ncounsel “provided ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel\\n\\nfailed to file a [Rule 404 (b)] motion relating to [Belin’s] propensity\\n\\nto carry firearms.” 15 In support of this claim, Ward argued that “the\\n\\n\\n      14 We express no opinion as to whether a Rule 404 (b) notice to the State\\n\\nwould have been required under these circumstances.\\n     15 Ward did not specify in his motion for new trial what evidence his trial\\n\\n                                      36\\n heart of [his] defense was self[-]defense,” and thus, his trial\\n\\n“[c]ounsel’s failure to properly file a motion to introduce the\\n\\ncharacter of [Mr.] Belin related to the use of firearms under [Rule\\n\\n404 (b)]” fell below “the standard of what a reasonable attorney\\n\\nwould do under the circumstances and prejudiced Mr. Ward’s ability\\n\\nto support his self-defense claim” because that evidence was\\n\\n“probative”    of   “whether     a   reasonable     person   under   the\\n\\ncircumstances would have felt threatened sufficiently to justify the\\n\\nuse of deadly force.”\\n\\n     At the motion-for-new-trial hearing, evidence was presented to\\n\\nshow that Belin was arrested on May 25, 2018 and October 12, 2020\\n\\nfor, respectively: (1) possession of a firearm on school grounds after\\n\\nlaw enforcement discovered a firearm inside a motor vehicle\\n\\nassociated with Belin parked at the local high school; and (2)\\n\\npossession of a firearm after law enforcement discovered a firearm\\n\\ninside a motor vehicle associated with Belin parked on a street\\n\\n\\ncounsel should have sought to admit under Rule 404 (b).\\n                                     37\\n where law enforcement officers were responding to a noise\\n\\ncomplaint.16 Ward’s trial counsel testified that, during trial\\n\\npreparation, investigators in the public defender’s office ran a\\n\\ncriminal history report for Belin and “check[ed] social media for\\n\\nanything that might be out there.” Ward’s trial counsel stated that,\\n\\nbased on Belin’s criminal history report, he was aware of Belin’s\\n\\nMay 2018 arrest “for firearm on school grounds.” However, trial\\n\\ncounsel indicated that, while he knew Belin had been incarcerated\\n\\nin late 2020 for a probation violation, he did not know how Belin’s\\n\\nprobation had been violated or that Belin had been arrested again\\n\\nin October 2020. Ward’s trial counsel testified that he advised Ward\\n\\nbefore trial that evidence of Belin’s May 2018 arrest “wasn’t\\n\\nadmissible because the judge had ruled on a motion in limine that it\\n\\nwas not admissible,” and the defense was “not going to be allowed to\\n\\n\\n\\n     16 At the motion-for-new-trial hearing, the prosecutor advised the trial\\n\\ncourt that the State and Ward—through his motion-for-new-trial counsel—had\\n“agreed to stipulate” that Belin was “in custody” for the October 2020 charge\\nfrom October 12, 2020 until February 28, 2021, shortly before the crimes at\\nissue occurred.\\n                                      38\\n go into it.” When trial counsel was asked whether he thought it\\n\\nwould have been “proper to try and file a 404 (b) motion to try to get\\n\\nthat evidence in” based on Ward’s self-defense claim, trial counsel\\n\\nresponded that he did not consider filing a Rule 404 (b) motion\\n\\nbecause he “didn’t think it would do any good in view of [the trial\\n\\ncourt’s] ruling on the motion in limine already.” On cross\\n\\nexamination, Ward’s trial counsel confirmed that he argued during\\n\\nthe hearing on the State’s motion in limine that information about\\n\\nBelin’s incarceration “should come in,” but he “gathered from [the\\n\\ntrial court’s] ruling that [the court] was going to put a very tight\\n\\n[rein] on what [they] could get into with Mr. Belin,” and “the gun\\n\\nwas not one that I could get into.”\\n\\n     In the order denying Ward’s motion for new trial, the trial court\\n\\nnoted that, during the motion in limine hearing, Ward’s trial counsel\\n\\nstated that the defense had “some photographs” of Belin with guns\\n\\nand “a criminal case disposition for having carried a gun on school\\n\\ngrounds” that the defense wanted to use at trial to show Belin’s\\n\\n                                 39\\n “propensity to carry a gun,” but Ward’s trial counsel did not show\\n\\nthe trial court any such photographs or documentation. The trial\\n\\ncourt observed that, in ruling on the State’s motion in limine, the\\n\\ntrial court advised the parties that it would “revisit the issue” at trial\\n\\nif “a reason were to arise” for the court to do so, but Ward’s trial\\n\\ncounsel “did not later request [the trial court] to revisit the issue.”\\n\\nThe trial court then noted that, at the motion for new trial hearing,\\n\\n“evidence was presented about 2 instances in which Mr. Belin had\\n\\nbeen arrested for having possessed, constructively, a firearm,” but\\n\\nconcluded that this evidence did not demonstrate that Belin “had a\\n\\nviolent character trait” and would not have been “an essential\\n\\nelement of [Ward’s] self-defense claim.”          The trial court also\\n\\nconcluded that this evidence did not “indicate that Belin had ever\\n\\nused a firearm offensively against another person” or that Ward\\n\\n“had been involved in either incident.” The trial court further\\n\\ndetermined that evidence of Belin’s arrests and any photographs of\\n\\nBelin with guns “would not have been admissible under [OCGA §§\\n\\n                                   40\\n 24-4-404 (a) (2) or 24-4-405] to demonstrate that Mr. Belin had\\n\\nallegedly possessed a firearm during his fatal encounter with\\n\\n[Ward].”\\n\\n     On this basis, the trial court concluded that Ward’s trial\\n\\ncounsel was not deficient for electing not to file a Rule 404 (b) motion\\n\\nseeking to admit this evidence because “if the [d]efense had filed\\n\\nsuch [a] reverse Rule 404 (b) motion solely to try to show Mr. Belin’s\\n\\npropensity for possessing a firearm, such purpose would have\\n\\nconstituted sheer propensity evidence that [the trial court] would\\n\\nhave been authorized to exclude from trial.” The trial court also\\n\\nruled that “any marginal relevance or probative value of that other\\n\\nact evidence would have been substantially outweighed by the\\n\\ndanger of unfair prejudice” and, thus, “excludable under OCGA § 24-\\n\\n4-403.” The trial court further determined that, “even pretermitting\\n\\nany deficiency in this regard, [Ward] ha[d] not established the\\n\\nprejudice prong” of Strickland.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  41\\n       On appeal, Ward contends that his trial counsel was deficient\\n\\nin conceding to the trial court’s pretrial ruling on the State’s motion\\n\\nin limine and in failing to file a Rule 404 (b) motion to introduce\\n\\nevidence of Belin’s prior “gun charge” because this evidence was\\n\\nadmissible to show “the character of Mr. Belin related to the use of\\n\\nfirearms” and Belin’s “propensity to carry firearms” and was\\n\\nrelevant to Ward’s self-defense claim. 17 Ward further argues that\\n\\nhis trial counsel’s failure to seek to admit this evidence prejudiced\\n\\nWard’s ability to support his self-defense claim. We see no merit to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      17 In his briefing, Ward does not mention any photographs of Belin “with\\n\\nguns”—i.e., the photographs referenced by his trial counsel during the motion\\nin limine hearing—or argue that those photographs would have been\\nadmissible under Rule 404 (b) had his trial counsel filed the requisite Rule 404\\n(b) motion, so we assume Ward has abandoned any such claim on appeal. See\\nHarris v. State, \\n313 Ga. 653\\n, 665 (6) n.13 (\\n872 SE2d 732\\n) (2022) (noting that\\nappellant abandoned any claim that a Brady violation occurred with respect to\\nrecords from his prior trial “by failing to make any argument in support of it\\non appeal”) (citing former Supreme Court Rule 22 (“Any enumerated error not\\nsupported by argument or citation of authority in the brief shall be deemed\\nabandoned.”)). Additionally, Ward does not make any argument or cite to any\\nlegal authority in support of his contention that his trial counsel was\\nineffective by failing to object to the trial court’s pretrial ruling granting the\\nState’s motion in limine; thus, we assume this claim is similarly abandoned.\\nSee \\nid.\\n\\n                                        42\\n these contentions, as Ward has not shown that this evidence would\\n\\nhave been admissible at trial.\\n\\n     (b) First, although OCGA § 24-4-404 (a) (2) provides that “an\\n\\naccused may offer evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the\\n\\nalleged victim, for the purpose of proving action in conformity\\n\\ntherewith,” that evidence “is generally limited [by OCGA § 24-4-405\\n\\n(a)] to testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an\\n\\nopinion.” Copeland, 316 Ga. at 458 (3) (b) (citing OCGA §§ 24-4-404\\n\\n(a) (2) and 24-4-405 (a); punctuation omitted). See also Wofford v.\\n\\nState, \\n305 Ga. 694\\n, 698 (2) (c) (\\n827 SE2d 652\\n) (2019) (“Character\\n\\nabout a victim generally is limited to reputation or opinion, not\\n\\nspecific bad acts.”). And, in cases where an accused is arguing self-\\n\\ndefense, the accused may only seek to introduce evidence of the\\n\\nvictim’s violent character through the admission of “reputation and\\n\\nopinion testimony.” Strong v. State, \\n309 Ga. 295\\n, 313-314 (3) (\\n845\\n\\nSE2d 653\\n) (2020).    We have held that “‘specific instances’ of a\\n\\nvictim’s conduct,” Copeland, 316 Ga. at 458 (3) (b) (quoting OCGA §\\n\\n                                 43\\n 24-4-405 (b)), are not admissible where the accused is arguing self-\\n\\ndefense because “a victim’s violent character is not an essential\\n\\nelement of a self-defense claim.” Strong, 390 Ga. at 313-314 (3)\\n\\n(holding that OCGA § 24-4-404 (a) “allowed [an a]ppellant to offer\\n\\nevidence of [the victim’s] violent character, as that trait was\\n\\npertinent to [the a]ppellant’s claim of self-defense,” but OCGA § 24-\\n\\n4-405 (a) required that this trait be “proved only with reputation and\\n\\nopinion testimony”; emphasis in original).\\n\\n     Here, to the extent Belin’s purportedly violent character was\\n\\npertinent to Ward’s claim of self-defense at trial, Ward could only\\n\\nprove this character trait “by reputation and opinion testimony,”\\n\\nwhich Ward never sought to do and does not argue his trial counsel\\n\\nshould have done. Strong, 309 Ga. at 313-314 (3). See also Beck,\\n\\n310 Ga. at 498 (3). Instead, Ward argues that his trial counsel\\n\\nshould have sought to prove Belin’s purportedly violent character\\n\\nthrough the admission of his prior gun charge, which was not\\n\\nadmissible for this purpose. See Strong, 309 Ga. at 313-314 (3).\\n\\n                                 44\\n And, because Belin’s prior gun charge was not admissible for this\\n\\npurpose, Ward’s trial counsel was not deficient in failing to introduce\\n\\nevidence of this prior conviction at trial. See Wofford, \\n305 Ga. at 699\\n\\n\\n(2) (c) (“Absent a showing that these prior convictions would have\\n\\nbeen admissible at trial, [the appellant] cannot prove that his lawyer\\n\\nrendered ineffective assistance when he failed to present evidence of\\n\\nthe prior convictions.”).\\n\\n     (c) Additionally, we have held that “[s]pecific instances of a\\n\\nvictim’s past conduct may also be admitted, not to show the victim’s\\n\\naction in conformity therewith, but rather [to] establish the\\n\\ndefendant’s state of mind and the reasonableness of the defendant’s\\n\\nuse of force.” Copeland, 316 Ga. at 458 (3) (b) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). See also OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (allowing\\n\\nevidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts” to be “offered to prove the\\n\\ncircumstances immediately surrounding the charged crime, motive,\\n\\nor prior difficulties between the accused and the alleged victim”).18\\n\\n\\n     18 As we did in Roberts v. State, \\n305 Ga. 257\\n, 260 (3) (\\n824 SE2d 326\\n)\\n\\n                                   45\\n However, “[b]ecause such evidence is offered as proof of the\\n\\ndefendant’s state of mind at the time of the charged crime, it is only\\n\\nadmissible if there is proof that the defendant actually knew about\\n\\nthe victim’s prior acts at that time.” Copeland, 316 Ga. at 458-459\\n\\n(3) (b).\\n\\n      Here, there is no evidence that Ward “was aware at the time of\\n\\nthe shooting[]” of Belin’s 2018 conviction, “so the conviction[] would\\n\\nnot have been admissible to show” Ward’s “state of mind or the\\n\\nreasonableness of his conduct” when he shot Belin in March 2021.\\n\\nWofford, \\n305 Ga. at 698\\n (2) (c) (citing OCGA § 24-4-404 (b)). Given\\n\\nthat nothing in the record shows that Ward “actually knew” about\\n\\nBelin’s prior conviction, Copeland, 316 Ga. at 459 (3) (b), or had\\n\\n“personal knowledge” of “any specific acts of violence” by Belin at the\\n\\ntime the shooting occurred, Ward’s claim of ineffective assistance\\n\\nbased on his counsel’s alleged failure to seek to introduce evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2019), we again assume without deciding that Rule 404 applies to evidence\\nregarding the other acts of a victim or third party.\\n                                       46\\n of this conviction fails. Beck, 310 Ga. at 498 (3) (concluding that,\\n\\nonly where “the defendant had personal knowledge” of “a victim’s\\n\\nspecific acts of violence,” will those acts potentially “be admissible to\\n\\nshow the defendant’s state of mind with respect to self-defense”).\\n\\n     For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that, because\\n\\nWard failed to establish that “his counsel performed in an objectively\\n\\nunreasonable way considering all the circumstances and in light of\\n\\nprevailing professional norms,” Ward has failed to prove that his\\n\\ncounsel performed deficiently. Ward, 313 Ga. at 273 (4). See also\\n\\nCopeland, 316 Ga. at 456 (3) (“To overcome the strong presumption\\n\\nthat counsel performed reasonably, the defendant must show that\\n\\nno reasonable lawyer would have done what his lawyer did, or would\\n\\nhave failed to do what his lawyer did not.”) (quotation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).

SHRIVER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      MILLER, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      Christopher Shawn Shriver appeals from the trial court’s order denying his\\n\\nmotion to dismiss this criminal case based on an alleged violation of his constitutional\\n\\nright to a speedy trial. Because the court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the\\n\\nfour-factor balancing test for constitutional speedy trial claims, we affirm.\\n\\n      On October 16, 2017, Shriver was allegedly involved in a physical altercation\\n\\nwith another man at an office of the Division of Family and Children Services.\\n\\nAccording to the State and five witnesses who provided written statements shortly\\n\\nafter the incident, Shriver approached the alleged victim, punched him in the face, and\\n\\nbit off his ear, all in the presence of a one-year-old child. However, according to two\\n other witnesses who provided written statements shortly after the incident, the alleged\\n\\nvictim threw the first punch.\\n\\n          Shriver was arrested shortly after the incident and released on bond the next\\n\\nday. Shriver was charged by indictment in December 2018 with simple battery (OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-5-23 (a)), aggravated battery (OCGA § 16-5-24 (a)), and cruelty to children in the\\n\\nthird degree (OCGA § 16-5-70 (d)). In March 2019, the State provided Shriver with\\n\\ndiscovery, including a list of witnesses to the incident and their written statements,\\n\\naddresses, and telephone numbers. Shriver waived formal arraignment and pled not\\n\\nguilty.\\n\\n          In August 2021, Shriver waived his right to a jury trial and requested a bench\\n\\ntrial. The trial court scheduled a bench trial for September 20, 2021. However, on\\n\\nSeptember 2, 2021, Shriver changed his mind and demanded a jury trial.\\n\\n          Shriver did not invoke his constitutional right to a speedy trial until February\\n\\n7, 2023, when he filed a motion to dismiss the case based on an alleged violation of this\\n\\nright.1 At a March 15, 2023 hearing on the motion to dismiss, Shriver’s counsel stated\\n\\nthat (1) the defense had attempted to contact the witnesses to the incident but had\\n\\n          1\\n        Shriver never filed a statutory demand for speedy trial pursuant to OCGA\\n§ 17-7-170.\\n                                              2\\n only been able to contact one inculpatory witness, and (2) Shriver had completed his\\n\\nmaster’s degree in mental counseling but had been unable to obtain a counseling\\n\\nlicense because of this case. The State indicated that the defense needed to provide\\n\\ntestimony to support counsel’s statements, and counsel called a private investigator\\n\\nto testify that the defense retained him to locate and interview the witnesses but that\\n\\nhe had only been able to contact one inculpatory witness. Shriver, however, did not\\n\\ntestify at the hearing.\\n\\n       On June 6, 2023, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding that\\n\\nShriver’s constitutional right to a speedy trial had not been violated. As an initial\\n\\nmatter, the court found that the delay since Shriver’s arrest was presumptively\\n\\nprejudicial such that the court needed to conduct the four-factor balancing test for an\\n\\nalleged violation of the constitutional speedy trial right — specifically, the length of\\n\\nthe delay, the reasons for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his right, and any\\n\\nprejudice to him caused by the delay. Regarding the first factor, the court found that\\n\\nthe delay of over five years since Shriver’s arrest was uncommonly long and weighed\\n\\nagainst the State. Regarding the second factor, the court found that the reasons for the\\n\\ndelay should be weighed only slightly against the State because: (a) there was no\\n\\n\\n                                           3\\n evidence that the State had any intent to delay the case, and the delay appeared to be\\n\\nthe result of ordinary neglect; (b) the delay during the COVID judicial state of\\n\\nemergency was neutral; (c) the delay after the judicial state of emergency was\\n\\ninevitable and occurred when the courts were inundated with trial cases; and (d) when\\n\\nthe case had been set for a bench trial, Shriver withdrew his waiver and demanded a\\n\\njury trial.\\n\\n       Regarding the third factor, the trial court found that the delay by Shriver in\\n\\nasserting his right to a speedy trial weighed strongly against him, explaining that he did\\n\\nnot invoke his right until over four years after his indictment even though he had\\n\\nopportunities to do so and had been provided discovery. Regarding the fourth factor,\\n\\nthe court found that the prejudice to Shriver should be weighed slightly for him\\n\\nbecause: (a) he had been out on bond since his arrest; (b) there was no evidence that\\n\\nhe had suffered any unusual anxiety or concern due to the delay; and (c) both parties\\n\\nwould face problems caused by the unavailability of witnesses and the potentially\\n\\nfaded memories of available witnesses. In balancing the four factors and concluding\\n\\nthat Shriver’s right to a speedy trial had not been violated, the court emphasized his\\n\\nfailure to assert his right in due course.\\n\\n\\n                                             4\\n       Shriver filed an application for interlocutory review, which this Court granted.\\n\\nShriver then filed this appeal, in which he argues that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in balancing the four-factor test. Specifically, Shriver challenges the trial\\n\\ncourt’s assessment of the reasons for the delay, his assertion of his speedy trial right,\\n\\nand the prejudice to him. We conclude, however, that the trial court did not abuse its\\n\\ndiscretion in assessing these factors and in ultimately finding that Shriver’s speedy\\n\\ntrial right had not been violated.\\n\\n      The Sixth Amendment of the Bill of Rights guarantees that “[i]n all criminal\\n\\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy . . . trial.” U. S. Const.\\n\\nAmend. VI. The Georgia Constitution of 1983 affirms that “[i]n criminal cases, the\\n\\ndefendant shall have . . . a speedy trial.” Ga. Const. 1983, Art. I, Sec. I, Par.

The analysis has two\\n\\nstages. \\nId.\\n “First, the court must determine whether the [delay] is sufficiently long to\\n\\n\\n                                            5\\n be considered ‘presumptively prejudicial.’ If not, the speedy trial claim fails at the\\n\\nthreshold.” (Citation omitted.) \\nId.\\n “The right to a speedy trial attaches at the time of\\n\\narrest or formal accusation or indictment, whichever occurs first, and we measure the\\n\\ndelay from the time the right attaches.” (Citation omitted.) Singleton v. State, \\n317 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 637\\n, 639 (1) (\\n732 SE2d 312\\n) (2012). “Where no trial has occurred, the length of\\n\\ndelay should be calculated from the date of arrest or formal accusation to the date on\\n\\nwhich the motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds was decided.” Phan v. State, \\n290\\n\\nGa. 588\\n, 593 (1) (a) (\\n723 SE2d 876\\n) (2012). Here, there is no dispute that the delay of\\n\\nover five-and-a-half years is presumptively prejudicial. See Fallen v. State, \\n289 Ga.\\n\\n247\\n, 248 (1) (\\n710 SE2d 559\\n) (2011) (three-year delay triggered presumption of\\n\\nprejudice).\\n\\n      “If . . . the delay has passed the point of presumptive prejudice, the court must\\n\\nproceed to the second step of the Barker-Doggett analysis, which requires the\\n\\napplication of a delicate, context-sensitive, four-factor balancing test to determine\\n\\nwhether the accused has been deprived of the right to a speedy trial.” Ruffin, supra,\\n\\n284 Ga. at 55\\n (2).\\n\\n      [T]he four factors that form the core of the constitutional speedy trial\\n      balancing test are: (i) whether delay before trial was uncommonly long,\\n\\n                                           6\\n       (ii) whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame\\n      for that delay, (iii) whether, in due course, the defendant asserted the\\n      right to a speedy trial, and (iv) whether he or she suffered prejudice as\\n      the delay’s result.\\n\\n\\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) \\nId. at 56\\n (2) (b).\\n\\n      “Speedy trial claims require trial courts to engage in a difficult and sensitive\\n\\nbalancing process. This task is committed principally to the discretion of the trial\\n\\ncourt, and this Court has a limited role in reviewing the trial court’s decision.”\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Henderson v. State, \\n310 Ga. 231\\n, 235 (2) (\\n850\\n\\nSE2d 152\\n) (2020). Indeed, “[t]he trial court’s weighing of each factor and its\\n\\nbalancing of all four factors — its ultimate judgment — are reviewed on appeal only\\n\\nfor abuse of discretion.” State v. Porter, \\n288 Ga. 524\\n, 526 (2) (a) (\\n705 SE2d 636\\n)\\n\\n(2011), disapproved on other grounds, Johnson v. State, \\n315 Ga. 876\\n, 889 (3) n.11 (\\n885\\n\\nSE2d 725\\n) (2023). “We must accept the factual findings of the trial court unless they\\n\\nare clearly erroneous, and we must accept the ultimate conclusion of the trial court\\n\\nunless it amounts to an abuse of discretion, even though we might have reached a\\n\\ndifferent conclusion were the issue committed to our discretion.” (Citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted.) Henderson, supra, 310 Ga. at 235 (2).\\n\\n\\n                                          7\\n       1. Preliminarily, although the parties do not contest the issue, we note that the\\n\\ntrial court properly recognized that a pre-trial delay of over five years is uncommonly\\n\\nlong and should be weighed against the State. Labbee v. State, \\n362 Ga. App. 558\\n, 562\\n\\n(2) (a) (\\n869 SE2d 520\\n) (2022).\\n\\n      2. Shriver argues that the trial court should have weighed the reasons for the\\n\\ndelay strongly against the State because the COVID judicial emergency only\\n\\naccounted for a small portion of the delay and because he did nothing to contribute to\\n\\nthe delay. We disagree and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\\n\\nassessing this second factor in the Barker-Doggett analysis.\\n\\n      “Some amount of pretrial delay is unavoidable, and even quite extended\\n\\nintervals between arrest or indictment and trial are sometimes both necessary and\\n\\nreasonable. Consequently, the reason for the delay is pivotal in evaluating the strength\\n\\nof a constitutional speedy trial claim, as it can color the consideration of all other\\n\\nfactors.” (Citation omitted.) Ruffin, supra, \\n284 Ga. at 59\\n (2) (b) (ii). “Deliberate delay\\n\\nto gain an improper advantage over the accused strikes at the very heart of the speedy\\n\\ntrial guarantee and is thus weighted heavily against the government in the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            8\\n Barker-Doggett balancing process.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) \\nId.\\n Other\\n\\nreasons for delay include\\n\\n       overcrowded dockets, the government’s failure to provide for sufficient\\n       numbers of judges, prosecutors, or indigent defense counsel, neglect by\\n       the prosecution or other government agents, mere convenience of the\\n       prosecution, or the desire to avoid the expense of separate trials for two\\n       defendants involved in the same crime. Each of these reasons must be\\n       counted against the government in the Barker-Doggett analysis, though\\n       less heavily than delay designed to sabotage the accused’s case.\\n\\n\\n(Citation omitted.) \\nId. at 60\\n (2) (b) (ii). “[W]here no reason appears for a delay, we\\n\\nmust treat the delay as caused by the negligence of the State in bringing the case to\\n\\ntrial.” (Citation omitted.) \\nId. at 61\\n (2) (b) (ii).\\n\\n       Here, there is no evidence that the State intentionally delayed prosecuting\\n\\nShriver. In fact, a substantial portion of the delay was caused by circumstances beyond\\n\\nthe State’s control, and a slight portion of the delay was caused by Shriver himself.\\n\\nSpecifically, in March 2020 the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia issued\\n\\nan order declaring a statewide judicial emergency, pursuant to OCGA § 38-3-61, that\\n\\nsuspended jury trials in light of the COVID pandemic. Labbee, supra, 362 Ga. App. at\\n\\n559-560. The judicial emergency order thereafter was extended several times, and in\\n\\n\\n                                              9\\n March 2021 the prohibition on jury trials was lifted. Id. at 560 n.3.2 The pandemic was\\n\\na “catastrophic and unique event” beyond the control of the government or the\\n\\ndefense, and neither party is responsible for the delays caused by it. Id. at 566 (2) (b)\\n\\n(iv). Thus, the State cannot be faulted for the periods in 2020 and 2021 during which\\n\\nno jury trials were held, and the delays caused by overcrowded dockets following the\\n\\nresumption of jury trials are not entitled to significant weight. See State v. Adams, \\n364\\n\\nGa. App. 864\\n, 868 (2) (b) (i) (\\n876 SE2d 719\\n) (2022) (delay of just under 16 months\\n\\nattributable to the COVID judicial emergency was not weighed against either party).\\n\\nFurther, Shriver slightly contributed to the delay in this case by waiving his right to\\n\\na jury trial only to change his mind and demand a jury trial. “[W]hen any portion of\\n\\na delay in trial is caused by or at the behest of defense counsel, it should not be\\n\\nweighed against the State.” Williams v. State, \\n290 Ga. 24\\n, 26 (2) (\\n717 SE2d 640\\n)\\n\\n(2011).\\n\\n      Given that a substantial portion of the delay was not attributable to the State,\\n\\nand in the absence of evidence that the State intentionally delayed prosecuting\\n\\nShriver, we will not disturb the trial court’s decision to weigh this second factor only\\n\\n      2\\n       The judicial emergency order expired in June 2021. State v. Adams, \\n364 Ga.\\nApp. 864\\n, 868 (2) (b) (i) (\\n876 SE2d 719\\n) (2022).\\n                                           10\\n slightly against the State. See State v. Pickett, \\n288 Ga. 674\\n, 676 (2) (c) (2) (\\n706 SE2d\\n\\n561\\n) (2011) (“[T]he trial court correctly attributed the delay to the government and\\n\\ncorrectly weighed the factor against the State only benignly, as the delay was due to\\n\\nan overcrowded docket and not the result of a deliberate attempt to delay the trial in\\n\\norder to hamper the defense.”) (citation and punctuation omitted); Labbee, supra, 362\\n\\nGa. App. at 567 (2) (b) (iv) (trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the\\n\\ndelay in defendant’s trial resulting from the COVID pandemic was a neutral factor).\\n\\n      3. Shriver further argues that the trial court abused its discretion in strongly\\n\\nweighing against him the fact that he did not demand a speedy trial and that his failure\\n\\nto assert his speedy trial right should not matter given the extended delay in this case.\\n\\nWe disagree.\\n\\n      Pretrial delay often works to the advantage of the accused, because the\\n      government is constitutionally required to prove each element of its case\\n      beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, in the main, the dimming of memories\\n      and loss of evidence that inevitably accompany the passage of time tend\\n      to help rather than hinder the accused, with the result that delay is not\\n      an uncommon defense tactic. Many criminal defendants, particularly\\n      when they have been released on bond pending trial, would therefore\\n      prefer to drag out the process as long as possible. The Sixth Amendment\\n      and the corresponding provision of the Georgia Constitution place the\\n\\n\\n                                            11\\n       burden squarely on the government to ensure that individuals accused of\\n      crime are brought to trial in a timely manner. Nevertheless, the accused\\n      bears some responsibility to invoke the speedy trial right and put the\\n      government on notice that he or she, unlike so many other criminal\\n      defendants, would prefer to be tried as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\n      The accused is not required to demand a speedy trial at the first available\\n      opportunity, for the [United States] Supreme Court has expressly\\n      rejected the demand-waiver approach to the constitutional speedy trial\\n      right. Even so, a defendant who fails to assert the right at any point in the\\n      trial court will have an extremely difficult time establishing a violation of his\\n      or her constitutional right to a speedy trial.\\n\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied; citations and punctuation omitted.) Ruffin, supra, \\n284 Ga. at 62\\n\\n\\n(2) (b) (iii). “In order to invoke the right, the accused need not file a formal motion,\\n\\nthough that is certainly sufficient. Moreover, invocation of the speedy trial right need\\n\\nnot await indictment, information, or other formal charge; the accused can begin\\n\\ndemanding that the right to a speedy trial be honored as soon as he or she is arrested.”\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) \\nId. at 62-63\\n (2) (b) (iii).\\n\\n      Despite being represented by the same attorney throughout the case, Shriver\\n\\ndid not assert his constitutional right to a speedy trial at any point between his October\\n\\n2017 arrest and his February 2023 motion to dismiss, and he never filed a statutory\\n\\n                                             12\\n demand for speedy trial. “Because delay often works to the defendant’s advantage,\\n\\nthis factor is afforded strong evidentiary weight.” (Citations and punctuation\\n\\nomitted.) Phan, supra, 290 Ga. at 595 (1) (c). Indeed, the Supreme Court of Georgia\\n\\nhas explained that “[a] delay of over five years typically would warrant this factor\\n\\nbeing weighed heavily against the defendant.” (Emphasis in original). Pickett, \\nsupra,\\n\\n\\n288 Ga. at 677 (2) (c) (3).\\n\\n      Shriver’s argument that his failure to assert his speedy trial right should not\\n\\nmatter given the extended delay in his case is contrary to well-established law. A\\n\\nviolation of this right is not automatically established by virtue of an extended delay,\\n\\nbecause “none of the[] four factors is either a necessary or sufficient condition to the\\n\\nfinding of a deprivation of the right.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Harris v.\\n\\nState, \\n284 Ga. 455\\n, 455 (\\n667 SE2d 361\\n) (2008); see also Fallen, \\nsupra,\\n 289 Ga. at 248\\n\\n\\n(1) (“[T]he presumptive prejudice arising from delay cannot alone carry a Sixth\\n\\nAmendment claim without regard to the other Barker criteria. Instead, it is part of the\\n\\nmix of relevant facts, and its importance increases with the length of delay.”)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           13\\n       Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in strongly weighing against\\n\\nShriver his failure to assert his speedy trial right for more than five years. See Rucker\\n\\nv. State, \\n315 Ga. 568\\n, 581 (2) (c) (\\n883 SE2d 790\\n) (2023) (trial court acted within its\\n\\ndiscretion in weighing the third factor heavily against defendant, where he waited over\\n\\na year after he was indicted to assert his constitutional right to a speedy trial, and he\\n\\nnever filed a statutory speedy trial demand although he was represented by counsel\\n\\nthroughout the case); Brannen v. State, \\n274 Ga. 454\\n, 456 (\\n553 SE2d 813\\n) (2001)\\n\\n(where defendant filed no statutory demand for speedy trial and did not raise his\\n\\nconstitutional right to a speedy trial in the 51 months between his arrest and his\\n\\nmotion to dismiss, this factor was correctly weighed strongly against him).\\n\\n      4. Lastly, Shriver argues that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that\\n\\nthe delay’s prejudicial effect on him was minimal for the following reasons: no\\n\\nexculpatory witnesses can be located while an inculpatory witness was located; even\\n\\nif the exculpatory witnesses could be located their memories will be faded; and he\\n\\ncannot obtain a counseling license due to this case. We will not disturb the court’s\\n\\nassessment of the prejudice factor.\\n\\n      As for the final factor in our analysis, whether [Shriver] suffered\\n      prejudice as a result of the delay, there are three factors to consider:\\n\\n                                           14\\n        whether there has been oppressive pre-trial incarceration; the anxiety\\n       and concern of the accused; and the possibility of harm to the accused’s\\n       defense. Of these forms of prejudice, the most serious is the last, because\\n       the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the\\n       fairness of the entire system.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Harris, supra, 284 Ga. at 456.\\n\\n       (a) Shriver has not suffered any oppressive pre-trial incarceration, as he was\\n\\nreleased on bond the day after his arrest. See Singleton, \\nsupra,\\n 317 Ga. App. at 643\\n (2)\\n\\n(d) (i) (no oppressive pre-trial incarceration where defendant spent only three days in\\n\\njail following his arrest).\\n\\n       (b) Although Shriver’s counsel stated at the hearing on the motion to dismiss\\n\\nthat Shriver could not obtain a counseling license due to this case, the State indicated\\n\\nthat the defense needed to provide testimony to support counsel’s statement, and the\\n\\nonly evidence presented at the hearing consisted of the private investigator’s\\n\\ntestimony regarding his attempts to locate witnesses. In Porter, \\nsupra,\\n 288 Ga. at 530\\n\\n(2) (c) (4), the Supreme Court of Georgia explained that “no actual evidence or\\n\\nappropriate proffer” established the death of the defendant’s witnesses where the\\n\\ndefendant “did not testify at the hearing, but merely informed the trial court orally,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           15\\n apparently from his seat at counsel table, that two of his witnesses had died.” See also\\n\\nHoward v. State, \\n307 Ga. App. 822\\n, 828 (2) (d) (\\n706 SE2d 163\\n) (2011) (stating that the\\n\\nonly evidence offered by defendant to prove that his case had caused him great anxiety\\n\\nand concern constituted hearsay and therefore was of no probative value, and that he\\n\\ncould have mitigated any anxiety and concern by asserting his right to a speedy trial\\n\\nsooner). Thus, Shriver has made no showing of undue anxiety or concern.\\n\\n      (c) Regarding the possibility of harm to Shriver’s defense, we will not disturb\\n\\nthe trial court’s finding that both parties would face problems caused by the\\n\\nunavailability of witnesses and the potentially faded memories of available witnesses.\\n\\nWe simply cannot say that the court abused its discretion, made a clearly erroneous\\n\\nfactual finding, or misapplied the law. See Porter, \\nsupra,\\n 288 Ga. at 526 (2) (a) (where\\n\\nthe trial court has clearly erred in its factual findings or misapplied the law, the\\n\\ndeference owed its ruling is diminished).\\n\\n      Despite finding that Shriver had not suffered oppressive pre-trial incarceration\\n\\nor undue anxiety or concern, the trial court ultimately weighed the prejudice factor in\\n\\nShriver’s favor, indicating a recognition of the difficulties he faced due to the apparent\\n\\ndisappearance of the two exculpatory witnesses. And in assessing prejudice, the court\\n\\n\\n                                            16\\n was permitted to credit the evidence that four inculpatory witnesses could not be\\n\\nlocated. See Brannen, \\nsupra,\\n 274 Ga. at 458\\n (“Although we agree that [the defendant]\\n\\nis disadvantaged by her inability to examine [the dead witness] at trial, the State is also\\n\\nprejudiced by its inability to cross-examine the witness and put before the jury the\\n\\nalternate theory that [the victim] was threatening suicide rather than threatening [the\\n\\ndefendant’s] life.”). And both parties will likely face problems caused by the dimmed\\n\\nmemories of available witnesses. “Delay is not an uncommon defense tactic. As the\\n\\ntime between the commission of the crime and trial lengthens, witnesses may become\\n\\nunavailable or their memories may fade. If the witnesses support the prosecution, its\\n\\ncase will be weakened, sometimes seriously so. And it is the prosecution which bears\\n\\nthe burden of proof.” (Citation omitted.) \\nId.\\n Although we may have given more\\n\\nweight to the possibility of harm to Shriver’s defense if we were tasked with making\\n\\nthe assessment in the first instance, it is not our job to do so. State v. Buckner, \\n292 Ga.\\n\\n390\\n, 391 n.3 (\\n738 SE2d 65\\n) (2013). And given the absence of oppressive pre-trial\\n\\nincarceration or undue anxiety or concern, we cannot say that the trial court abused\\n\\nits discretion in weighing the prejudice factor only slightly for Shriver.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            17\\n       5. Considering the four factors together, we conclude that the trial court did not\\n\\nabuse its discretion in finding that there was no violation of Shriver’s constitutional\\n\\nright to a speedy trial. As explained above, we will not disturb the court’s analysis of\\n\\nthe four factors. And when the factors that weigh in Shriver’s favor are considered\\n\\nalong with his failure for over five years to invoke his speedy trial right and the fact\\n\\nthat a substantial portion of the delay was caused by the COVID pandemic and other\\n\\ninnocuous reasons, the court was within its discretion in denying the motion to\\n\\ndismiss.\\n\\n      “We weigh the relative prejudice resulting from the missing witness[es] against\\n\\n[Shriver’s] decision to forego the election to seek a speedy trial.” Brannen, \\nsupra,\\n 274\\n\\nGa. at 458\\n. “We do not condone the considerable delay in bringing [Shriver’s] case\\n\\nto trial, and we are especially concerned by the year[s] of apparent inactivity in his\\n\\ncase. Nevertheless, [Shriver’s] belated assertion of his constitutional right to a speedy\\n\\ntrial weighs heavily against him.” Howard, \\nsupra,\\n 307 Ga. at 829 (2) (e). Thus,\\n\\nShriver’s assertion of his right so “late in the process” is “[c]entral to our decision\\n\\nto affirm the trial court’s judgment.” Ruffin, supra, 284 Ga. at 66 (3); see also Porter,\\n\\nsupra,\\n 288 Ga. at 532 (2) (d) (“If all four factors point in one direction, the result of\\n\\n\\n                                           18\\n weighing them together will be clear, but otherwise, under the circumstances of a\\n\\nparticular case, any one factor may be weighty enough to tip the balance.”).\\n\\n      However, the clock is still ticking. It has now been well over [five] years\\n      since [Shriver] was indicted, and the vigor and formality with which he\\n      has pressed his constitutional speedy trial claim are no longer subject to\\n      challenge. The District Attorney should be aware that any further delay\\n      in bringing [Shriver] to trial not attributable to [him] runs a serious risk\\n      of violating [his] right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Sixth\\n      Amendment and the Georgia Constitution. If that were to happen, then\\n      under controlling United States Supreme Court precedent, dismissal of\\n      the charges against [Shriver] would be constitutionally required.\\n\\n\\nRuffin, supra, 284 Ga. at 66 (3).\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the denial of Shriver’s motion to dismiss.\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed.

STROUD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n       Richard Stroud, Jr., was convicted of felony murder and\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony in\\n\\nconnection with the shooting death of Frederick Cade.1 Stroud\\n\\n\\n       1 Frederick Cade was shot on the night of August 13-14, 2017. Stroud\\n\\nand Jarvis Lamont Milton were indicted by a Wilkes County grand jury on\\nFebruary 4, 2019, individually and as parties to a crime and co-conspirators,\\non charges of violating the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act (Count\\n1), malice murder (Count 2), felony murder based on aggravated assault (Count\\n3), possession of a firearm in the commission of a crime (Count 4), and\\naggravated assault (Count 5). After Milton’s case was severed, Stroud was\\ntried before a jury in November 2019, and he was acquitted on Count 2 but\\nfound guilty on Counts 3, 4, and 5. Count 1 was nolle prossed before trial. The\\ntrial court sentenced Stroud on Count 3 to life in prison with the possibility of\\nparole and on Count 4 to five years in prison, to run consecutively to Count 3.\\nCount 5 was merged into Count 3 for sentencing. Milton was tried separately\\nin May 2019, and his appeal is before this Court as Case No. S24A0068.\\n       Stroud filed a motion for new trial on November 12, 2019, which was\\namended by new counsel on July 21, 2022. On July 20, 2023, the trial court\\ndenied Stroud’s motion as amended. Stroud filed a notice of appeal on May 1,\\n2023, and an amended notice of appeal on August 8, 2023. This appeal was\\n appeals from his convictions, asserting that (1) the State did not\\n\\npresent sufficient evidence to support his convictions beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt and (2) the trial court should have granted his\\n\\nmotion for a directed verdict. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\\n\\n     1. The evidence at trial showed that in August 2017, Cade was\\n\\nmarried to Shakevia Graves, who had a son, D.G., with Stroud.\\n\\nStroud’s co-indictee, Jarvis Lamont Milton, had been dating\\n\\nShakevia’s twin sister, Shanevia (“NeNe”) Graves, for six to seven\\n\\nyears. 2 Shakevia and Cade’s marriage was volatile. The two would\\n\\noften argue, and their arguments would sometimes turn physical.\\n\\nAs a result, Shakevia often stayed at her grandparents’ house, which\\n\\nwas where NeNe lived at the time. NeNe testified that there was\\n\\nfriction between Cade and Stroud because Cade did not like that\\n\\nShakevia “cheated” on him with Stroud. Shakevia said that the two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndocketed to the term of this Court beginning in December 2023 and submitted\\nfor a decision on the briefs.\\n       2 Because the Graves sisters’ names are so similar and to avoid\\n\\nconfusion, we will refer to Shakevia by her full name and Shanevia by her\\nnickname, “NeNe,” which is how counsel and witnesses primarily referred to\\nher during trial.\\n                                    2\\n men argued about Stroud’s lack of support of D.G. because Cade took\\n\\ncare of the child and chastised Stroud for not doing his part.\\n\\n     On Sunday, August 13, 2017, Cade and Shakevia were not\\n\\ngetting along, and she was staying at her grandparents’ house. That\\n\\nnight, Shakevia and NeNe decided to drive to a nearby pool hall.\\n\\nWhile they were parked there, NeNe saw Cade’s truck driving over\\n\\na railroad track near the pool hall. NeNe alerted Shakevia, and the\\n\\nsisters sped off, with Shakevia driving. Cade followed them, and\\n\\nboth vehicles drove through the neighborhood until Shakevia pulled\\n\\ninto her grandparents’ house. Cade pulled behind the sisters’ car but\\n\\ndid not get out and instead drove away.\\n\\n     NeNe and Shakevia stayed outside, and NeNe called Milton to\\n\\ncome over. Stroud drove Milton to the grandparents’ house in\\n\\nStroud’s car. After their arrival, NeNe got into the back of Stroud’s\\n\\ncar. While Shakevia was approaching the car, Cade suddenly\\n\\nappeared and rushed her from behind. Both Shakevia and Cade\\n\\nended up inside the backseat of Stroud’s car, fighting over the fact\\n\\nthat Shakevia was with Stroud. NeNe got out of the car because\\n\\n                                  3\\n Cade and Shakevia were fighting “on top” of her. Shakevia exited\\n\\nthe car behind NeNe and ran to the porch of the house with Cade\\n\\nfollowing her. NeNe testified that as this altercation was occurring,\\n\\nStroud and Milton were upset about Cade’s actions, and there was\\n\\n“a small argument,” but no one was “passing licks.” Milton and\\n\\nStroud jumped out of the car, and Stroud argued with Cade about\\n\\nhis fighting with Shakevia in front of her grandmother. Shakevia\\n\\ntestified that as Stroud escorted Cade out of the yard, still talking\\n\\nto him, she heard Milton yell and saw him pull out a gun. When\\n\\nCade walked away, the altercation ended, and Shakevia went inside\\n\\nthe house. Stroud, Milton, and NeNe returned to the car. Shakevia\\n\\ntestified that the three then drove away in Stroud’s car in the\\n\\ndirection opposite from where Cade was walking. Shakevia stayed\\n\\nbehind and began repeatedly calling and texting Cade’s cell phone\\n\\nbut never got a response.\\n\\n     NeNe testified that after she, Stroud, and Milton left the house,\\n\\nthe three planned to stop at a nearby house so that she could buy a\\n\\ncigar. But as they were driving there, they saw Cade walking on the\\n\\n                                  4\\n other side of the road. Stroud’s car windows were down, and when\\n\\nCade yelled to Stroud, Stroud and Milton began to argue with Cade.\\n\\nNeNe said they were initially just “hollering and yelling.” However,\\n\\nStroud stopped the car, and Stroud and Milton got out. Cade\\n\\nimmediately hit Stroud, and a fight ensued. NeNe was upset and\\n\\nstayed in the car. Cade and Stroud were fighting off the side of the\\n\\nroad in the mud, but NeNe testified that Milton stood outside the\\n\\ncar right next to her during the fight. NeNe then heard a loud\\n\\ngunshot. Stroud ran back to the car, got in, and said, “Bro, I done\\n\\nf**ked up[;] we got to get the f**k on.” NeNe testified that when\\n\\nStroud got back in the car, his shirt was off and he was bare- chested.\\n\\nNeNe never saw a gun, but she saw Stroud put his shirt between his\\n\\nlegs on the floor of the car. Stroud, Milton, and NeNe drove off, and\\n\\nthe men took NeNe back to her grandparents’ house. Shakevia\\n\\nconfirmed that NeNe returned home, upset, about one hour after she\\n\\nleft with Stroud and Milton. NeNe yelled at Shakevia that Shakevia\\n\\nwas “stupid” for calling Cade’s phone while “they was fighting.”\\n\\nWhen Shakevia asked what happened, NeNe did not answer, but\\n\\n                                  5\\n said, “You and everybody else will know what happened to him\\n\\ntomorrow.”\\n\\n     Cade’s body was discovered early on the morning of August 14,\\n\\n2017, lying on the pavement in a dark, isolated area near the\\n\\ngrandparents’ house. Attending medical personnel and law\\n\\nenforcement investigators observed that Cade appeared to have\\n\\nsuffered at least one gunshot wound to the arm and that he also had\\n\\nan injury to his torso. Emergency medical services personnel called\\n\\nto the scene detected no signs of life. Law enforcement investigators\\n\\nalso observed that Cade’s body and clothing were muddy. The\\n\\ninvestigators also discovered muddy shoe prints and a blood trail\\n\\nbeginning near a muddy area on the side of the road where one\\n\\ninvestigator said it looked “like something had happened.” The blood\\n\\ntrail ended at the body, suggesting that Cade had traveled for some\\n\\ndistance before collapsing to the pavement. Samples taken from the\\n\\nblood trail on the roadway were later determined to match a sample\\n\\nof Cade’s blood collected during his autopsy.\\n\\n     Later that morning, Shakevia was questioned by Georgia\\n\\n                                 6\\n Bureau of Investigation (“GBI”) Agents Austin Bradshaw and\\n\\nDerrick Glasco. Her responses led the agents to NeNe, Stroud, and\\n\\nMilton. Agent Bradshaw said that, at first, NeNe was “not very\\n\\ntruthful.” 3 As NeNe admitted at trial, she first told the agents that\\n\\nshe had not left the house that night, and she did not mention Stroud\\n\\nor Milton. It took some time before NeNe admitted that Stroud and\\n\\nMilton were at the grandparents’ house and before she told them\\n\\nthat Milton shot Cade. NeNe said that she identified Milton as the\\n\\nshooter after Agent Bradshaw told her that she was “going down the\\n\\nroad for this” and she needed “to say something.” However, Agent\\n\\nBradshaw testified that he just told NeNe how serious it was for her\\n\\nto be involved in a homicide investigation and that lying to him was\\n\\nnot in her best interest. Afterward, NeNe immediately said “Jarvis\\n\\n[Milton] shot Pooh,” which was Cade’s nickname.4\\n\\n      In her testimony at trial, NeNe denied that after she, Stroud,\\n\\n\\n      3 Agent Bradshaw read NeNe her rights under Miranda v. Arizona, \\n384\\n\\nU.S. 436\\n, 444 (86 SCt 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966), “out of an abundance of\\ncaution” because she was not being truthful.\\n       4 NeNe’s interviews were recorded, but the recordings were not played at\\n\\ntrial.\\n                                      7\\n and Milton left her grandparents’ house, they followed Cade.\\n\\nInstead, she said that the three were heading to buy a cigar when\\n\\nthey just happened upon Cade. However, NeNe admitted that she\\n\\n“probably” told the GBI agents in her interview that Stroud and\\n\\nMilton followed Cade and that she told the agents that Stroud said,\\n\\n“F**k it, let’s beat him up.” Agent Bradshaw, who interviewed\\n\\nNeNe, highlighted certain other areas where her interview diverged\\n\\nfrom her trial testimony. He recounted that NeNe also told\\n\\ninvestigators that Stroud stopped the car, and after he and Milton\\n\\nexited the car, they both got into a physical altercation with Cade.\\n\\nShe also told them that she heard a gunshot shortly before both men\\n\\ngot back into the car and that as they drove off, they passed Cade,\\n\\nclutching his right arm, which she demonstrated to the agents in her\\n\\ninterview. NeNe also acknowledged at trial that she told the GBI\\n\\nagents that after the gunshot, Stroud said, “Damn, bro, you f**ked\\n\\nup,” evidently referring to Milton, not “I f**ked up” as she testified\\n\\nat trial.\\n\\n      Agent Bradshaw testified that, after he interviewed both\\n\\n                                  8\\n sisters that morning, he went back to the crime scene to view it in\\n\\nthe daylight. While at the scene, near an area on the side of the road\\n\\nwhere it looked like an altercation had occurred and where the blood\\n\\ntrail and muddy shoe prints began, he discovered a gold pendant\\n\\n“like you wear on a necklace.” Investigators later discovered a photo\\n\\nof Stroud on his Facebook page wearing a very similar pendant\\n\\nnecklace.\\n\\n     Agent Bradshaw interviewed Stroud the morning that Cade\\n\\nwas found. 5 For approximately an hour, Stroud denied having any\\n\\nknowledge of what happened to Cade. But Agent Bradshaw noticed\\n\\nthat, like Cade’s body, Stroud had dried mud all over his clothing.6\\n\\nBradshaw then obtained Stroud’s consent for a search of his car,\\n\\nwhere investigators located mud and blood smears inside the\\n\\nvehicle. A blood smear located on the vehicle’s center console was\\n\\nlater determined to match Cade’s blood sample. After Agent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     5 Before the interview, Agent Bradshaw read Stroud his Miranda rights,\\n\\nand Stroud signed a waiver of rights form.\\n     6 Bradshaw also took pictures of Stroud at the time of his interview,\\n\\nwhich showed that his clothing was covered in mud and dirt.\\n                                    9\\n Bradshaw reported back to Stroud that blood and mud was found in\\n\\nhis car, Stroud eventually admitted that he, Milton, and NeNe had\\n\\ncome upon Cade walking the night before. Stroud said that Cade\\n\\nflagged the car down and told them to stop. Stroud and Milton exited\\n\\nthe car, and a physical altercation with Cade ensued, which moved\\n\\nover into the dirt on the side of the road. Stroud said that he was\\n\\ntrying to separate Cade and Milton, and at one point, Milton pistol-\\n\\nwhipped Cade. Stroud then heard a gunshot. Afterward, Stroud got\\n\\nback in the car with Milton and NeNe and drove off. Stroud said that\\n\\nhe dropped NeNe and Milton at Milton’s house, before he drove\\n\\nhimself home.\\n\\n     The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Cade’s\\n\\nbody testified that it appeared likely that a single bullet entered and\\n\\nexited his right arm, then re-entered his right torso where it struck\\n\\na rib, his right lung, and ultimately his heart, resulting in massive\\n\\nhemorrhaging and death. However, the medical examiner did not\\n\\nrule out the possibility that the wounds to the arm and torso may\\n\\nhave been caused by separate gunshots. The medical examiner also\\n\\n                                  10\\n found injuries to Cade’s forehead consistent with a pistol-whipping.\\n\\n     2. Stroud argues on appeal that the State failed to present\\n\\nsufficient evidence to support this convictions beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt as required under the standard set out in Jackson v. Virginia,\\n\\n443 U.S. 307\\n (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). “On appeal, a\\n\\ncriminal defendant is no longer presumed innocent, and we review\\n\\nwhether the evidence presented at trial, when viewed in the light\\n\\nmost favorable to the jury’s verdicts, enabled the jury to find the\\n\\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes of which\\n\\n[he] was convicted.” Fitts v. State, \\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 141 (3) (\\n859 SE2d\\n\\n79\\n) (2021), citing Jackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n (III) (B). “This limited\\n\\nreview leaves to the jury the resolution of conflicts in the evidence,\\n\\nthe weight of the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and\\n\\nreasonable inferences to be made from basic facts to ultimate facts.”\\n\\nMuse v. State, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n, 647 (2) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Stroud was charged both individually and as a party to a crime\\n\\nwith felony murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of\\n\\n                                 11\\n a crime. A person commits felony murder “when, in the commission\\n\\nof a felony, he or she causes the death of another human being\\n\\nirrespective of malice.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (c). “Felony murder requires\\n\\nonly that the defendant possessed the requisite criminal intent to\\n\\ncommit the underlying felony—in this case, aggravated assault,\\n\\nwhich also does not require intent to kill.” Mathews v. State, \\n314 Ga.\\n\\n360\\n, 365 (1) (\\n877 SE2d 188\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). OCGA § 16-11-106 (b) (1) prohibits any person from\\n\\n“hav[ing] on or within arm’s reach of his or her person a firearm . . .\\n\\nduring the commission of, or the attempt to commit . . . [a]ny crime\\n\\nagainst or involving the person of another.”\\n\\n      OCGA § 16-2-20 (a) provides that “[e]very person concerned\\n\\nin the commission of a crime is a party thereto and may be charged\\n\\nwith and convicted of commission of the crime.” To obtain a\\n\\nconviction of a person as a party to the crime, the State must prove\\n\\n“that he intentionally aided or abetted in the commission of the\\n\\ncrimes or intentionally advised, encouraged, counseled, or procured\\n\\nsomeone else to commit the crimes.” Frazier v. State, \\n308 Ga. 450\\n,\\n\\n                                  12\\n 453 (2) (a) (\\n841 SE2d 692\\n) (2020). “Conviction as a party to a crime\\n\\nrequires proof of a common criminal intent, which the jury may infer\\n\\nfrom the defendant’s presence, companionship, and conduct with\\n\\nanother perpetrator before, during, and after the crimes.” Rooks v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 743\\n, 751 (2) (\\n893 SE2d 899\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). Therefore, to prove Stroud guilty of the\\n\\ncharges of felony murder and possession of a firearm during the\\n\\ncommission of a felony, it was not necessary for the State to prove\\n\\nthat he personally possessed a weapon or fired a gun at Cade as long\\n\\nas the State proved that Stroud acted as a party to those crimes. See\\n\\nScoggins v. State, \\n317 Ga. 832\\n, 836-39 (1) (a)-(b) (\\n896 SE2d 476\\n)\\n\\n(2023) (even where evidence did not conclusively establish which of\\n\\ntwo defendants shot victim or had a weapon, evidence of a common\\n\\ncriminal intent, including defendant’s presence, companionship, and\\n\\nconduct before and immediately after the fatal shooting supported\\n\\nconvictions as a party to the crimes of murder and possession of a\\n\\nfirearm).\\n\\n     We conclude that the evidence presented at trial, when viewed\\n\\n                                 13\\n in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, was sufficient as a\\n\\nmatter of constitutional due process to support Stroud’s convictions\\n\\nfor felony murder predicated on aggravated assault and possession\\n\\nof a firearm during the commission of a felony. The evidence, viewed\\n\\nin this light, showed that shortly before the shooting, Stroud was\\n\\ninvolved in a verbal altercation with Cade over Cade’s physical fight\\n\\nwith Shakevia at her grandparents’ house. Afterward, Stroud\\n\\nfollowed Cade in his car and expressed a desire to beat him up.\\n\\nStroud stopped the car when he saw Cade, argued with him, and\\n\\nthen got out to confront him. Stroud then engaged in a physical\\n\\naltercation with Cade before the shooting, and Stroud’s muddy\\n\\nappearance the next morning and the discovery of the pendant at\\n\\nthe crime scene supported that he engaged in the fight. Moreover,\\n\\nCade’s blood was found on the front, center console of Stroud’s car,\\n\\nalong with mud on the floorboards. Although Stroud was not seen\\n\\nwith a gun, NeNe testified that, after the shooting, she saw him\\n\\nbare-chested and placing his shirt on the floor of the car between his\\n\\nlegs, from which the jury could have inferred that he was stashing a\\n\\n                                 14\\n gun wrapped in his shirt. She also testified that shortly after she\\n\\nheard a gunshot, Stroud returned to the car saying that he had\\n\\n“f****d up.”\\n\\n     Although there also was evidence at trial that NeNe previously\\n\\nidentified Milton as the shooter and that Shakevia saw Milton with\\n\\na gun shortly before Cade was shot, and although the ballistics\\n\\nevidence was inconclusive about how many guns were involved in\\n\\nthe shooting, “it is the role of the jury to resolve conflicts in the\\n\\nevidence and to determine the credibility of witnesses, and the\\n\\nresolution of such conflicts adversely to the defendant does not\\n\\nrender the evidence insufficient.” Reed v. State, \\n314 Ga. 534\\n, 537 (1)\\n\\n(\\n878 SE2d 217\\n) (2022). See also Lewis v. State, \\n314 Ga. 654\\n, 659 (2)\\n\\n(\\n878 SE2d 467\\n) (2022).\\n\\n     Moreover, even if the jury believed that Milton, and not Stroud,\\n\\nshot Cade, there was ample evidence of Stroud’s conduct before,\\n\\nduring, and after the shooting for the jury to find Stroud guilty as a\\n\\nparty to the crimes because of a shared criminal intent. The evidence\\n\\nrecounted above supported that Stroud was involved in a fight with\\n\\n                                 15\\n Cade, Stroud indicated to Agent Bradshaw that Cade was shot\\n\\nduring the course of the fight, and he and Milton rode away from the\\n\\nscene together after the shooting, leaving Cade there. See Scoggins,\\n\\n317 Ga. at 837 (1) (a); Martin v. State, \\n316 Ga. 154\\n, 154, 155-56 (2)\\n\\n(\\n886 SE2d 795\\n) (2023) (evidence sufficient to support defendant’s\\n\\nconviction as a party to the crimes of felony murder and possession\\n\\nof a firearm during the commission of a felony where defendant’s cell\\n\\nphone was recovered at the crime scene and it contained photos of\\n\\ndefendant wearing distinctive shirt shown in surveillance footage of\\n\\nman struggling with the victim moments before victim was shot);\\n\\nWilliams v. State, \\n291 Ga. 501\\n, 504 (1) (c) (\\n732 SE2d 47\\n) (2012)\\n\\n(concluding that the evidence established that defendant was a\\n\\nparty to the crime where it showed that he was present when the\\n\\ncrimes were committed and the jury could infer from his conduct\\n\\nbefore and after the crimes that he shared a common criminal intent\\n\\nwith the actual perpetrators); Johnson v. State, \\n276 Ga. 368\\n, 371 (1)\\n\\n(\\n578 SE2d 885\\n) (2003) (although the evidence showed that weapon\\n\\nwas in the physical possession of defendant’s co-indictee, defendant\\n\\n                                 16\\n was guilty of possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony where defendant was accomplice of the person who was in\\n\\nphysical possession of the pistol).\\n\\n      Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence at trial was\\n\\nsufficient to authorize the jury to find Stroud guilty of felony murder\\n\\nand the firearm possession charge beyond a reasonable doubt as\\n\\neither a direct participant or as a party to the crimes.\\n\\n      3. Stroud also asserts that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\nmotion for directed verdict made at the close of the State’s evidence\\n\\nat trial.\\n\\n      However, “[t]he standard of review for the denial of a motion\\n\\nfor a directed verdict of acquittal is the same as for determining the\\n\\nsufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction.” Smith v. State,\\n\\n304 Ga. 752\\n, 754 (\\n822 SE2d 220\\n) (2018) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). “Under this review, we must put aside any questions about\\n\\nconflicting evidence, the credibility of witnesses, or the weight of the\\n\\nevidence, leaving the resolution of such things to the discretion of\\n\\nthe trier of fact.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.)

BAKER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        WARREN, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Morgan Baker was convicted of malice murder in\\n\\nconnection with the shooting death of Tamarco Head.1 In his sole\\n\\nenumeration of error, Baker contends that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion under OCGA § 24-4-403 (“Rule 403”) by admitting into\\n\\nevidence a portion of a rap music video. As explained below, we\\n\\nagree that the trial court’s admission of the video was an abuse of\\n\\n\\n        1 Head was killed on July 6, 2019.  In February 2021, a Houston County\\ngrand jury indicted Baker for malice murder, felony murder, and aggravated\\nassault. At a trial from February 8 to 11, 2022, a jury found him guilty of all\\ncounts. The trial court sentenced him to serve life in prison for malice murder;\\nthe remaining counts were vacated by operation of law or merged. Baker filed\\na timely motion for new trial, which he later amended through new counsel.\\nAfter a hearing, the trial court entered an order denying the motion in\\nDecember 2022. In February 2023, Baker filed a motion to set aside that order\\nfor lack of notice. The trial court granted the motion, vacated its order, and re-\\nentered it on March 7, 2023. Baker then filed a timely notice of appeal, and\\nthe case was docketed to the August 2023 term of this Court and orally argued\\non August 23, 2023.\\n discretion. And because the State has not met its burden of showing\\n\\nthat the error was harmless, we reverse Baker’s conviction.\\n\\n     1. (a) The Pretrial Ruling to Admit the Rap Music Video Into\\n            Evidence\\n\\n     Before trial, Baker filed a motion to exclude from evidence a\\n\\nmusic video of the rap song “Ghetto Angels” by Kobe Crawford (a rap\\n\\nartist known as “NoCap”), which was “filmed in early 2019” and\\n\\nshowed Baker “holding a semi-automatic pistol with an extended\\n\\nmagazine.” The motion argued, among other things, that the video’s\\n\\nprobative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of\\n\\nunfair prejudice under Rule 403. After a hearing on the motion, the\\n\\ntrial court ruled that a 33-second-long portion of the video was\\n\\nadmissible, concluding that it was relevant to establish Baker’s\\n\\n“identity” and the relationship between Baker and Crawford. The\\n\\ncourt also ruled, without explanation, that the “short clip [wa]s more\\n\\nprobative than prejudicial.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  2\\n       (b) The Trial\\n\\n      The evidence presented at Baker’s trial showed the following. 2\\n\\nBaker was close friends with Crawford and worked as his road\\n\\nmanager, traveling with him to various concert venues to assist with\\n\\nhis performances. On the night of July 5, 2019, Crawford, Baker,\\n\\nand several other members of Crawford’s “entourage”3 drove in a\\n\\nblack van to a nightclub in Warner Robins, where Crawford was\\n\\nscheduled to perform.\\n\\n      According to Crawford’s music manager—Rodney Dunn—and\\n\\nthe owner of the nightclub, the van parked behind the nightclub, and\\n\\nCrawford, Baker, and other members of the entourage hung out in\\n\\na “VIP” room in the nightclub until Crawford performed around 1:00\\n\\nor 1:30 a.m. The performance ended around 2:00 a.m., when the\\n\\nnightclub was scheduled to close, and Crawford and some of the\\n\\n\\n      2 Because this case requires our assessment of whether an evidentiary\\n\\nerror was harmless, see Division 2 (d) below, “we review the record de novo and\\nweigh the evidence as we would expect reasonable jurors to have done.” Jivens\\nv. State, Case No. S23A1078, \\n2023 WL 8721065\\n, at *4 (decided Dec. 19, 2023).\\n\\n      3 Crawford’s brother, one of Crawford’s friends, and a man who was\\ninvolved in the music industry and his friends were also part of the entourage.\\nNone of these people testified at trial.\\n                                      3\\n members of the entourage left through the rear exit and got back in\\n\\nthe van.\\n\\n     Meanwhile, patrons left through the front door of the\\n\\nnightclub, where several security guards stood. Baker went out the\\n\\nfront door with the crowd, but he then tried to go back inside the\\n\\nnightclub. One of the security guards testified as follows. A man,\\n\\nlater identified as Baker, and another man who appeared to be with\\n\\nBaker, tried to come back inside, but the guard said that the two\\n\\nmen could not come in because the nightclub was closed.               An\\n\\nargument ensued, and several security guards pushed the men out\\n\\nthe door. Baker and the other man then walked down the breezeway\\n\\nof the strip mall where the nightclub was located, toward a pawn\\n\\nshop. Several security guards, including Head, stood near the door\\n\\nof the nightclub, talking. A few minutes later, gunfire rang out from\\n\\nthe direction of the pawn shop; it sounded as though there was more\\n\\nthan one shooter. Head was shot, and he fell to the ground, dead.4\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 The medical examiner who later performed Head’s autopsy testified\\n\\nthat she recovered no bullets or bullet fragments from Head’s body.\\n                                      4\\n More gunfire later erupted “right up the street.”\\n\\n     Video recordings from the surveillance cameras at the\\n\\nnightclub showed the following. 5 At 2:04 a.m., a crowd of people filed\\n\\nthrough the front door to exit the nightclub. Baker, who had a short\\n\\nhairstyle and wore a white T-shirt with black writing on the front,\\n\\nwalked outside, followed by a taller man wearing a black shirt and\\n\\na camouflage ball cap. The two men stood near the door, briefly\\n\\ntalked to a woman, and then walked down the breezeway. At 2:06\\n\\na.m., Baker and the man in the camouflage cap walked back toward\\n\\nthe nightclub together and tried to go inside, but a few security\\n\\nguards stopped them. Baker and one of the security guards argued\\n\\nand then shoved each other, and the man in the cap lunged toward\\n\\nthe guards. Baker pulled him back as the security guards pushed\\n\\nBaker and the other man out the door, and it appears that Baker\\n\\nand some of the guards tried to hit each other. Baker then put his\\n\\narm around the man in the camouflage cap, and at 2:07 a.m., they\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     5 The video recordings did not include audio.\\n\\n                                     5\\n walked down the breezeway and out of view. 6 Several of the security\\n\\nguards, including Head, stood together talking in front of the door,\\n\\nand approximately two minutes later, Head suddenly fell down as\\n\\nblood spattered on the ground near him.\\n\\n     Dunn (Crawford’s music manager) testified that after the\\n\\nperformance that night, he got in his car, and he thought that\\n\\nCrawford, Baker, and the rest of the entourage got in the van, which\\n\\nwas still parked behind the nightclub. As Dunn pulled out onto the\\n\\nstreet, following the van, he heard gunshots. He did not see anyone\\n\\nget into the van after he heard the shots. At some point, Dunn asked\\n\\nBaker if he was involved in the shooting, and Baker denied it. Dunn\\n\\nalso testified that members of Crawford’s entourage typically did not\\n\\ncarry guns to Crawford’s performances.\\n\\n     In response to the prosecutor’s questions about the “Ghetto\\n\\nAngels” rap music video, Dunn testified that the song was about the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     6  It was undisputed at trial that Baker was the man in the white T-shirt\\nwho was involved in the altercation with the security guards. Baker’s trial\\ncounsel mentioned this fact during his opening statement, and as discussed\\nmore below, Baker admitted it during his testimony.\\n                                      6\\n death of Crawford’s cousin, who had been shot 17 times years\\n\\nearlier; the video showed Baker and several other men waving guns;\\n\\nDunn did not know what kind of gun Baker held or whether any of\\n\\nthe guns were real or fake; and Dunn discouraged Crawford from\\n\\nusing guns in his music videos. During cross-examination, trial\\n\\ncounsel elicited Dunn’s testimony that rap artists often use guns in\\n\\ntheir music videos “to portray that they are somebody deserving of\\n\\nstreet cred” and that record labels encouraged the use of guns in\\n\\nmusic videos.\\n\\n     On redirect, the prosecutor introduced the 33-second-long\\n\\nportion of the rap music video, which the trial court admitted into\\n\\nevidence over trial counsel’s renewed objection, and the prosecutor\\n\\nplayed the video for the jury. The first few seconds of the video\\n\\nshowed Baker waving a black handgun, pointing it at the camera,\\n\\nand motioning as if he was shooting the gun while three other men\\n\\nrapped and made hand gestures. The video then showed Baker,\\n\\nCrawford, and about a dozen other men singing and dancing on and\\n\\naround a car; Baker waved the black handgun, sometimes pointing\\n\\n                                 7\\n it at the camera, while some of the men made hand gestures, held\\n\\nbottles of what appears to be alcohol, and brandished guns. In\\n\\nresponse to further questions from the prosecutor, Dunn identified\\n\\nBaker as one of the men who was “flashing [a] firearm” and testified\\n\\nthat although Dunn did not condone guns, he could not control\\n\\nwhether Crawford’s entourage used guns in the music video or\\n\\nwhether they carried guns on the night of the shooting.          The\\n\\nprosecutor then asked why Crawford “promot[ed]” gun violence in\\n\\nthe video, and Dunn responded that Crawford was not promoting it\\n\\nand that Crawford was simply “a rapper.”\\n\\n     Another security guard testified that there were no security\\n\\nissues in the nightclub before the altercation with Baker, and that\\n\\nafter Baker and the man in the camouflage cap walked toward the\\n\\npawn shop, gunfire erupted from that direction. He did not see who\\n\\nshot, but the gunfire sounded like it came from “multiple guns.”\\n\\n     A patron of the nightclub testified that shortly before the shots\\n\\nwere fired, she was standing in the breezeway with her sister when\\n\\ntwo men walked past her toward the pawn shop. One of the men\\n\\n                                  8\\n wore a white shirt; the other man, who was taller, wore a black shirt\\n\\nand had his arm around the man in the white shirt. She heard one\\n\\nof them say something like, “[D]on’t worry about it; we gonna get\\n\\nthem.” She then got in a car with her sister and heard gunshots, but\\n\\nshe could not tell from which direction they came, and she did not\\n\\nsee a shooter. The sister similarly testified that two men walked\\n\\npast her toward the pawn shop as she stood in the breezeway\\n\\nmoments before the shooting; one of the men wore a white shirt and\\n\\nthe other wore a black shirt.7\\n\\n     An off-duty police officer who was hired to provide security in\\n\\nthe parking lot of the nightclub testified that after the nightclub\\n\\nclosed, he heard gunshots that sounded like they were fired from\\n\\nmultiple guns, and he saw muzzle flashes near the pawn shop. A\\n\\nfew moments later, he heard another set of gunshots, which sounded\\n\\nas if a shooter was driving around outside the nightclub. He told\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     7 A third woman, who was with the sisters that night, testified that she\\n\\nheard gunshots, followed by another set of gunshots, coming from the direction\\nof the pawn shop; she thought the shots came from only one gun; and she did\\nnot see who shot.\\n                                      9\\n investigators at the scene that he saw a shooter, who wore a light-\\n\\ncolored shirt and a ball cap, near the pawn shop. At trial, he testified\\n\\nthat he did not see a shooter or recall describing a shooter to\\n\\ninvestigators, but he insisted that what he told investigators was\\n\\n“definitely the truth.”\\n\\n     Another patron, La’Destiny Orr-Oglesby, testified as follows.\\n\\nShe was standing near her car, which was parked in front of the\\n\\npawn shop, when two men in the breezeway by the shop began\\n\\nshooting handguns in the direction of the nightclub. One of the\\n\\nshooters was short; had short hair, “light” skin, and a tattoo on his\\n\\nleft arm; and wore a white shirt with writing on the front. The other\\n\\nshooter was tall, had dark skin, and wore a dark shirt and dark hat.\\n\\nWhen the men stopped shooting, they ran to a dark van that was\\n\\nparked on the side of the strip mall near the pawn shop.           The\\n\\nprosecutor   played   the   surveillance   recordings    showing    the\\n\\naltercation among Baker, the man in the camouflage cap, and the\\n\\nsecurity guards, and Orr-Oglesby identified Baker and the man in\\n\\nthe camouflage cap as the shooters. She also testified that when the\\n\\n                                  10\\n lead detective for the case interviewed her and showed her the\\n\\nsurveillance recordings, she similarly identified Baker and the man\\n\\nin the camouflage cap as the shooters.8\\n\\n      The lead detective testified that when Orr-Oglesby spoke to an\\n\\ninvestigator on the day of the shooting, she “g[a]ve a description of\\n\\nwho . . . she saw shooting.” (The lead detective did not elaborate\\n\\nfurther about that description.) Two days later, on July 8, the lead\\n\\ndetective showed Orr-Oglesby a photo lineup that did not include a\\n\\nphoto of Baker, and she did not identify any of the photos in the\\n\\nlineup as a photo of the shooter. The lead detective interviewed Orr-\\n\\nOglesby again that day, and she said that she saw two shooters—\\n\\none of the shooters was short, had light skin and a tattoo on his left\\n\\narm, and wore a white T-shirt, and the other shooter wore a dark\\n\\nshirt and dark hat. When the detective interviewed her again on\\n\\nAugust 21, he showed her the surveillance recordings from the\\n\\n\\n      8 Orr-Oglesby also testified that in the weeks before trial, she had been\\n\\narrested for a misdemeanor ticket, for driving on a suspended license, and for\\nfailing to report to her probation officer. The District Attorney’s office arranged\\nfor her release from jail so that she could prepare to testify. Her charges were\\nstill pending at the time of trial.\\n                                        11\\n nightclub, and Orr-Oglesby identified the two men who fought with\\n\\nsecurity guards as the shooters.\\n\\n     While reviewing social media posts associated with Crawford,\\n\\nthe lead detective found the “Ghetto Angels” rap music video; he\\n\\ndetermined that one of the men in the video was the same man\\n\\nshown on the surveillance recordings of the altercation with the\\n\\nsecurity guards; and he “eventually learned” that the man was\\n\\nBaker. The prosecutor then played the rap music video for the jury\\n\\nagain. The detective identified Crawford and Baker in the video,\\n\\nsaying that Baker was “holding what appear[ed] to be a firearm.”\\n\\nOn cross-examination, defense counsel tendered into evidence and\\n\\nplayed for the jury a video recording of Orr-Oglesby’s August 21\\n\\ninterview, and the detective acknowledged that Orr-Oglesby said\\n\\nduring that interview that she “d[id]n’t think the light-skinned guy\\n\\nwas shooting.” 9\\n\\n\\n     9 During the remainder of the interview, Orr-Oglesby repeatedly referred\\n\\nto two shooters and gave descriptions of them that were consistent with the\\ndescriptions she gave at trial. Defense counsel asked Orr-Oglesby during\\ncross-examination if she told the lead detective that she “d[id]n’t think the\\n\\n                                     12\\n      The prosecutor tendered into evidence a photo of Baker that\\n\\nwas taken while he was on stage with Crawford on the night of the\\n\\nshooting; the photo showed that Baker had short hair and a tattoo\\n\\non his left arm and wore a white T-shirt with writing on it.10\\n\\nForensic testing showed that Baker’s fingerprints were on two\\n\\nplastic cups found in the “VIP” room of the nightclub.\\n\\n     A crime scene investigator found seven .45-caliber shell casings\\n\\nand 15 9mm shell casings near the pawn shop. A firearms examiner\\n\\nlater determined that all of the .45-caliber shell casings were fired\\n\\nfrom the same gun (although he could not determine the make and\\n\\nmodel of the gun), and all of the 9mm shell casings were fired from\\n\\nthe same Smith & Wesson 9mm pistol. Investigators did not recover\\n\\nthe guns used in the shooting, nor did they determine the identity of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlight-skinned guy was shooting,” and Orr-Oglesby stated that she did not\\nremember saying that and that she “always said there w[ere] two people\\nshooting.”\\n\\n     10 The photo, which was admitted without objection, depicted Baker\\ngesturing as if he was shooting a gun.\\n                                  13\\n the man in the camouflage cap. 11\\n\\n      The defense presented testimony from two witnesses who saw\\n\\nshots fired in the area surrounding the nightclub around 2:00 a.m.—\\n\\nnear the time of the shooting in this case. One of the witnesses\\n\\ntestified that his truck was hit by a bullet as he was driving at the\\n\\ncorner down the street from the nightclub, but he could not tell\\n\\nwhere the shots came from. The other witness testified that he saw\\n\\nshots fired from three vehicles—a black truck, a white Toyota\\n\\nSolara, and an SUV—about a block away from the nightclub. 12 The\\n\\ndefense also presented a surveillance video recording from the\\n\\n\\n      11 Investigators also found two .40-caliber shell casings in the nightclub\\n\\nparking lot, three 9mm shell casings north of the nightclub, and two .223 shell\\ncasings in a store parking lot a couple of blocks away. The lead detective\\ntestified that he did not know whether any of these shell casings were related\\nto the shooting in this case. The firearms examiner determined that the 9mm\\nshell casings found north of the nightclub were not fired from the same gun\\nthat fired the 9mm shell casings found near the pawn shop.\\n\\n      12 In connection with the gunshots that the witnesses described, the lead\\n\\ndetective testified that he learned that shortly after the shooting in this case,\\nshots were fired at an intersection about a block away from the nightclub.\\nInvestigators found 11 .40-caliber and 9mm shell casings near the intersection.\\nThe firearms examiner determined that the .40-caliber shell casings near the\\nintersection were fired from the same gun that fired the .40-caliber shell\\ncasings found in the nightclub parking lot; the 9mm shell casings from the\\nintersection were not fired from the gun that fired the 9mm shell casings found\\nnorth of the nightclub or the 9mm shell casings found near the pawn shop.\\n                                       14\\n nightclub that showed that about 30 minutes before the shooting in\\n\\nthis case, a security guard escorted an unidentified man in a white\\n\\nshirt out of the nightclub and into the parking lot.\\n\\n     Baker testified in his own defense as follows. After Crawford,\\n\\nhis close friend since childhood, performed on the night of the\\n\\nshooting, Baker went out the front door of the nightclub to look for\\n\\na woman he had talked with earlier that night. The man in the\\n\\ncamouflage cap, whom Baker did not know but had seen in the “VIP”\\n\\nroom at the nightclub earlier, followed him outside and tried to\\n\\n“latch on” to him because the man wanted to take a photo with\\n\\nCrawford. Baker, with the man beside him, briefly spoke to the\\n\\nwoman, and then walked down the breezeway to look for someone\\n\\nelse; the man in the cap followed him. Baker eventually decided to\\n\\ngo to the van, which was parked behind the nightclub, so he tried to\\n\\ngo back inside, and the man again followed him. When a security\\n\\nguard told Baker that he could not come in, Baker was angry and\\n\\nasked what the problem was. The security guard pushed him, and\\n\\nthe man in the cap began yelling. Several security guards pushed\\n\\n                                 15\\n Baker and the man out the door, and the man ran past Baker to\\n\\nfight with the guards. Baker pulled the man back and stepped\\n\\nbetween the man and a security guard; a guard punched Baker in\\n\\nthe face as he tried to break up the fight. Baker and the man then\\n\\nwalked down the breezeway, and the man asked Baker if he was\\n\\nalright. Baker replied that he was and then walked around the side\\n\\nof the strip mall to the parking lot behind the nightclub, where the\\n\\nvan was parked, as the man in the cap walked in a different\\n\\ndirection. According to Baker, he wanted to distance himself from\\n\\nthe man because the man had escalated the situation with the\\n\\nsecurity guards.   Baker then got in the van, which drove away\\n\\nmoments later. As the van turned onto the street in front of the\\n\\nnightclub, Baker heard gunshots. The van then drove to Atlanta,\\n\\nwhere Baker and others in the entourage stayed overnight.\\n\\nAlthough Crawford was scheduled to perform in Tupelo, Mississippi\\n\\nthe next night, Baker did not travel there and did not continue\\n\\ntouring with Crawford, because Baker wanted to go home to see his\\n\\ninfant daughter. Baker squarely denied having a gun that night or\\n\\n                                16\\n being involved in the shooting.\\n\\n     On cross-examination, Baker testified that he put his arm\\n\\naround the man in the camouflage cap as they walked down the\\n\\nbreezeway because Baker was trying to “de-escalate the situation,”\\n\\nsince the man was still angry. The prosecutor asked whether the\\n\\nentourage traveled with guns, and Baker responded, “Why would\\n\\nwe, though?” The prosecutor said, “Well, let’s see why” and then\\n\\nplayed the rap music video again. In response to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nquestions about the video, Baker testified that he did not produce\\n\\nthe video, that it was about “losing loved ones,” that he thought he\\n\\nhad “a Glock” gun in the video, he did not know “what kind” of Glock\\n\\nit was, it was not his gun, and he used it in the video because he was\\n\\n“trying to look cool.” When the prosecutor asked why that made him\\n\\n“look cool,” Baker responded, “[I]n the music industry in—in my age\\n\\ngroup, you do whatever that you think will sell, such as if—if I was\\n\\nto—say I was a country music artist, I probably don’t like cowboy\\n\\nhats or cowboy boots, but I will wear it if I think it’s going to help\\n\\nmy country music sell.”     The prosecutor asked why Baker was\\n\\n                                  17\\n “promoting” gun violence in the video, and he replied that he was\\n\\nnot promoting it and was “[j]ust trying to be cool.” The prosecutor\\n\\nthen rewound the video and paused it at a point where it depicted\\n\\nBaker; she asked him if the shirt he was wearing said “Loyalty is\\n\\nLove,” and he replied that he did not know. Later, the prosecutor\\n\\nreferenced the photo showing Baker on stage with Crawford,\\n\\ngesturing as if he was pointing a gun, and asked if Baker was\\n\\n“[p]ortraying a shooter” “[j]ust like in the video we just watched,\\n\\nwith a real gun?” Baker replied that he was “just trying to be cool.”\\n\\n     The State’s theory of the case was that the man in the\\n\\ncamouflage cap was part of Crawford’s entourage; the man and\\n\\nBaker shot toward the security guards, killing Head, after the\\n\\naltercation at the door of the nightclub; and they then fled in the van\\n\\nwith the rest of the entourage. During closing argument, defense\\n\\ncounsel argued that Orr-Oglesby’s testimony was not credible\\n\\nbecause she told the lead detective that the “light-skinned” man did\\n\\nnot shoot and because she testified that the van was parked on the\\n\\nside of the strip mall, whereas other witnesses testified that it was\\n\\n                                  18\\n parked behind the nightclub; and alternatively, that the shooter in\\n\\nthe white shirt was someone else, as the evidence showed that\\n\\nshootings were frequent in that area. As to the rap music video,\\n\\ndefense counsel argued that the video was a performance that\\n\\nmerely showed Baker “wanting to act cool.”\\n\\n     The prosecutor argued in closing that Orr-Oglesby was\\n\\ncredible, that her testimony that there were two shooters was\\n\\nsupported by the ballistics evidence, that given the undisputed\\n\\nevidence showing that Baker wore a white shirt that night and that\\n\\nhe fought with the security guards, it was improbable that the man\\n\\nin the cap began shooting with a different person who also happened\\n\\nto be wearing a white shirt, and that the evidence that Baker did\\n\\nnot continue touring with Crawford after the shooting allowed an\\n\\ninference of guilt.\\n\\n     The prosecutor also asserted that Baker’s testimony that he did\\n\\nnot have a gun on the night of the shooting was not credible, because\\n\\n“[t]hey don’t roll like that.” She went on:\\n\\n     Use your common sense. And you know why you can say\\n\\n                                  19\\n      they don’t roll like that? Go back to that Ghetto Angels\\n     video. Right? That’s all they know, the gun violence.\\n     They want to promote it. They want to live by the sword,\\n     but they don’t want to die by it, right? When it’s not\\n     convenient, they don’t want to act like they promote the\\n     shooting.\\n\\nNear the end of her argument, she asserted that “[t]his gun violence\\n\\nneeds to stop,” saying that it was sad that the altercation at the front\\n\\ndoor ended in Head’s murder. She then said, “We’re better than\\n\\nthat. We’re better than that. Your job is to return a verdict.” She\\n\\nclosed by saying: “The truth is it’s time to tell Morgan Baker that\\n\\nwe’re going to hold him accountable for exactly what he did that\\n\\nnight.   That we’re going to h[o]ld him accountable for ending a\\n\\nhuman life. That it’s not a game, it’s not about a rap video. It’s real.”\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the jury found Baker guilty of malice murder,\\n\\namong other crimes, and he was sentenced to serve life in prison.\\n\\n     (c) The Denial of Baker’s Motion for New Trial\\n\\n     In his motion for new trial, Baker argued that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion by admitting the rap music video into evidence,\\n\\nasserting that the video was not relevant or probative because he\\n\\nnever disputed that he was close friends with Crawford or that he\\n                                   20\\n was at the nightclub on the night of the shooting. In its order\\n\\ndenying the motion, the trial court ruled that the video was properly\\n\\nadmitted, because it was relevant to show that Baker was part of\\n\\nthe entourage, that he had a motive to shoot Head, and that the lead\\n\\ndetective was able to identify him through the video. The trial court\\n\\nalso concluded, apparently as part of its analysis under Rule 403,\\n\\nthat although the video showed Baker waving a gun, the video was\\n\\nonly about 30 seconds long and “the behavior in the video [was] not\\n\\nin and of itself illegal and is relatively common in today’s music\\n\\nvideos.”\\n\\n     2. In his sole claim on appeal, Baker contends that the trial\\n\\ncourt abused its discretion under Rule 403 by admitting the portion\\n\\nof the rap music video into evidence. As discussed below, we agree.13\\n\\n\\n     13 Baker also makes a bare-bones assertion that the rap music video\\n\\nshould have been excluded under the First Amendment to the United States\\nConstitution. But given our conclusion that the video was not admissible\\nunder Rule 403 and that the error in admitting it was not harmless, we do not\\nreach Baker’s argument that the video also was not admissible under the First\\nAmendment.\\n       In addition, we note that the State contends that, although Baker\\npreserved for ordinary appellate review his claim about the rap music video,\\nhe affirmatively waived any argument about the audio, i.e., the lyrics of the\\n\\n                                     21\\n       (a) The Applicable Law\\n\\n      We begin with a review of the law that applies to Baker’s claim.\\n\\nUnder OCGA § 24-4-401 (“Rule 401”), “relevant evidence” is\\n\\nevidence that has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact\\n\\nthat is of consequence to the determination of the action more\\n\\nprobable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.”\\n\\n“The test for relevance is generally a liberal one, and [r]elevance is\\n\\na binary concept—evidence is relevant or it is not.” Harris v. State,\\n\\n314 Ga. 238\\n, 262 (\\n875 SE2d 659\\n) (2022) (citations and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). Under OCGA § 24-4-402 (“Rule 402”), relevant evidence is\\n\\ngenerally admissible, and evidence that is not relevant is not\\n\\nadmissible. Rule 402 also says, however, that the admissibility of\\n\\nrelevant evidence may be “limited by . . . law or by other rules.”\\n\\n\\nsong featured in the video. But the lyrics in the rap music video are, for the\\nmost part, indecipherable, and Baker makes no specific arguments about why\\nthey should have been excluded. Thus, we need not address the State’s\\ncontention, because the lyrics have no bearing on our conclusion that the rap\\nmusic video was improperly admitted. We note that the dissenting opinion\\nappears to argue that the unintelligibility of the lyrics in the rap music video\\n“further diminish[] any danger of unfair prejudice” under Rule 403, but the\\nlyrics’ unintelligibility would only mitigate any unfair prejudice flowing from\\nthe lyrics themselves—not any unfair prejudice from the images in the video,\\nto which we have limited our review here.\\n                                      22\\n OCGA § 24-4-402. One such limiting rule is Rule 403, which says,\\n\\n“Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\\n\\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\\n\\nconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury or by considerations\\n\\nof undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative\\n\\nevidence.”\\n\\n     We have often reiterated that “[t]he major function of Rule 403\\n\\nis to exclude matter of scant or cumulative probative force, dragged\\n\\nin by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.” Harris, 314 Ga.\\n\\nat 262-263 (citation and punctuation omitted). To that end, we have\\n\\nexplained probative value in this way:\\n\\n     Generally speaking, the greater the tendency to make the\\n     existence of a fact more or less probable, the greater the\\n     probative value. And the extent to which evidence tends\\n     to make the existence of a fact more or less probable\\n     depends significantly on the quality of the evidence and\\n     the strength of its logical connection to the fact for which\\n     it is offered. Probative value also depends on the\\n     marginal worth of the evidence—how much it adds, in\\n     other words, to the other proof available to establish the\\n     fact for which it is offered. The stronger the other proof,\\n     the less the marginal value of the evidence in question.\\n     And probative value depends as well upon the need for\\n     the evidence. When the fact for which the evidence is\\n\\n                                  23\\n       offered is undisputed or not reasonably susceptible of\\n      dispute, the less the probative value of the evidence.\\n\\nOlds v. State, \\n299 Ga. 65\\n, 75-76 (\\n786 SE2d 633\\n) (2016) (citations and\\n\\nfootnotes omitted).\\n\\n      As to the evaluation of prejudice under Rule 403, we have said\\n\\nthat “in a criminal trial, inculpatory evidence is inherently\\n\\nprejudicial; it is only when unfair prejudice substantially outweighs\\n\\nprobative value that the rule permits exclusion.” Harris, 314 Ga. at\\n\\n263 (emphasis in original; citation and punctuation omitted). The\\n\\nterm “unfair prejudice,” as it is used in Rule 403, refers to “the\\n\\ncapacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder\\n\\ninto declaring guilt on an improper basis rather than on proof\\n\\nspecific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v. United States, \\n519 U.S.\\n\\n172\\n (117 SCt 644, 136 LE2d 574) (1997).14 Generally, such improper\\n\\nbases for a finding of guilt include a criminal defendant’s bad\\n\\ncharacter or his propensity for violence. See, e.g., \\nid.\\n at 181-182\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      14 Because OCGA § 24-4-403 is “materially identical” to Federal Rule of\\n\\nEvidence 403, we look to federal appellate cases for guidance in interpreting\\nthe rule. See State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 556-558, 560 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018).\\n                                     24\\n (explaining that the risk that a jury will reach a guilty verdict\\n\\n“‘because a bad person deserves punishment’” creates a substantial\\n\\nprejudicial effect) (citation omitted); Harris, 314 Ga. at 271 (noting\\n\\nthat “‘[i]t does not follow because an accused person may have a bad\\n\\ncharacter that he is guilty of the particular offense for which he is\\n\\nbeing tried’”) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     In all, however, “the exclusion of evidence under Rule 403 is an\\n\\nextraordinary remedy which should be used only sparingly.” Id. at\\n\\n262 (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     (b) Relevance of the Rap Music Video\\n\\n     As an initial matter, we note that Baker does not argue that\\n\\nthe rap music video was not relevant evidence under Rules 401 and\\n\\n402. Indeed, as the trial court indicated in its orders regarding the\\n\\nadmission of the rap music video, the video tended to prove that\\n\\nBaker was involved in Crawford’s rap music business and was part\\n\\nof his “entourage,” making it more likely that Baker was present at\\n\\nthe nightclub just after Crawford’s performance, around the time of\\n\\nthe shooting. Thus, the video was relevant in that respect and\\n\\n                                     25\\n satisfies Rule 401.\\n\\n     The State argues that the video was also relevant with respect\\n\\nto four other purposes. First, the State asserts that the video was\\n\\nrelevant as “intrinsic evidence” to complete the story of the crime.\\n\\nSecond, the State claims that the video was relevant to identity\\n\\nbecause the lead detective testified that during his investigation, he\\n\\nreviewed the video, determined that one of the men in the video was\\n\\nthe same man shown on the surveillance recordings of the\\n\\naltercation with the security guards, and “eventually learned” that\\n\\nthe man was Baker. The State also asserts that the video was\\n\\nrelevant to establish Baker’s motive to shoot toward the security\\n\\nguards—that Baker’s involvement in the entourage caused him to\\n\\nbelieve he was “a big shot” and become enraged when the security\\n\\nguards “disrespected” him. Finally, the State argues that the video\\n\\nwas relevant to show that Baker had access to the guns used during\\n\\nthe shooting. Because Baker does not argue that the video was not\\n\\nrelevant, and particularly because “[t]he test for relevance is\\n\\ngenerally a liberal one,” we will assume without deciding that the\\n\\n                                 26\\n video was relevant for these purposes as well. See Harris, 314 Ga.\\n\\nat 262, 272 (assuming without deciding that evidence of the\\n\\nappellant’s sexual messages and conduct was relevant under Rule\\n\\n401 to prove his motive to murder the victim before ultimately\\n\\nconcluding that much of the evidence was not admissible under Rule\\n\\n403).\\n\\n        (c) Admissibility of the Rap Music Video under Rule 403\\n\\n        Turning to Rule 403, the rap music video had little, if any,\\n\\nprobative value in proving the points discussed above. First, the\\n\\nvideo’s probative force to show that Baker was part of Crawford’s\\n\\nentourage and was present at the nightclub around the time of the\\n\\nshooting was minimal.       That is because at trial, Baker did not\\n\\ndispute—and in fact admitted—that he was close friends with\\n\\nCrawford; he was Crawford’s road manager; he toured with\\n\\nCrawford as part of his entourage; he traveled in the van with\\n\\nCrawford to the nightclub; he hung out in the “VIP” room; and when\\n\\nsecurity guards refused to let him back inside the nightclub, he and\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   27\\n the man in the camouflage cap fought with them. 15 In addition, the\\n\\nState presented other substantial evidence to establish Baker’s\\n\\nrelationship with Crawford and his presence at the nightclub,\\n\\nincluding Dunn’s testimony on those points, the surveillance\\n\\nrecordings from the nightclub showing Baker fighting with security\\n\\nguards, a photo of Baker and Crawford on stage at the nightclub,\\n\\nand evidence that Baker’s fingerprints were on two plastic cups in\\n\\nthe “VIP” room. Put simply, given the extensive, definitive, and\\n\\nundisputed evidence that Baker worked for and traveled with\\n\\nCrawford and that Baker was at the nightclub near the time of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     15  In particular, defense counsel told the jury during his opening\\nstatement that Baker and Crawford had been “friends since adolescence”;\\nBaker “was working for [Crawford] as his road manager”; Baker toured the\\ncountry with Crawford to assist with “dozens of shows”; Baker traveled with\\nCrawford in the van to the nightclub in Warner Robins; they “were directed to\\nthis VIP area”; after the show, security guards prevented Baker from re-\\nentering the nightclub, and Baker (along with the unknown man in the\\ncamouflage cap) got into an altercation with the guards. And Baker admitted\\nduring his direct examination that Crawford was a “very close friend”; the two\\nhad known each other since Baker was “four years old”; he worked as\\nCrawford’s road manager and toured with him; he traveled in the van with\\nCrawford to the nightclub in Warner Robins; they went to the “VIP” room; he\\nsometimes performed on stage with Crawford; he was on stage during\\nCrawford’s performance at the nightclub; and he and the man in the\\ncamouflage cap fought with security guards.\\n                                     28\\n shooting, it was not necessary to show the rap music video—which\\n\\nsupported only the inference that Baker was part of Crawford’s\\n\\nentourage. Thus, the rap music video was minimally probative to\\n\\nestablish those points. See Olds, \\n299 Ga. at\\n76 & n.15 (explaining\\n\\nthat if a point is proved by other strong evidence, “the marginal\\n\\nvalue of the evidence in question” is decreased and that “‘[i]f the\\n\\nevidence . . . is cumulative of evidence already introduced, exclusion\\n\\nis more likely’”) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     For similar reasons, the rap music video lacked any significant\\n\\nprobative value to complete the story of the crime (and thus had\\n\\nlittle, if any, value as intrinsic evidence) or to establish identity by\\n\\nproving how the lead detective determined that Baker was the man\\n\\nshown in the surveillance recordings of the fight at the nightclub.\\n\\nAs we explained above, Baker admitted—and other evidence\\n\\nestablished—the aspects of the “story of the crime” that the State\\n\\nasserts the rap music video proved.         And the lead detective’s\\n\\ndetermination that Baker was the man shown in the surveillance\\n\\nrecordings was a detail of the investigation that was of little\\n\\n                                   29\\n consequence, particularly in light of Baker’s admission and the other\\n\\nundisputed evidence proving that he was in fact the man shown on\\n\\nthe recordings. See Olds, \\n299 Ga. at\\n76 & n.15.\\n\\n     The probative value of the rap music video to show Baker’s\\n\\nmotive was also negligible, at best. In this respect, the State failed\\n\\nto show a “logical and necessary link” between Baker’s waving and\\n\\npointing a gun during his performance of a rap song and his\\n\\nmotivation to shoot toward the security guards at the nightclub. If\\n\\nanything, the alleged “link” between the video and Baker’s motive\\n\\nappears to be the video’s portrayal of Baker as a violent gunman—a\\n\\nlink that essentially amounts to impermissible propensity evidence.\\n\\nKirby v. State, \\n304 Ga. 472\\n, 486-487 (\\n819 SE2d 468\\n) (2018)\\n\\n(explaining that “[m]otive is the reason that nudges the will and\\n\\nprods the mind to indulge the criminal intent” and that evidence of\\n\\nmotive “must be ‘logically relevant and necessary to prove\\n\\nsomething other than the accused’s propensity to commit the crime\\n\\ncharged”) (citation and punctuation omitted). See also Harris, 314\\n\\nGa. at 270 (noting that evidence of an alleged motive that lacks a\\n\\n                                 30\\n specific, logical link to the alleged crimes often supports only\\n\\nimproper propensity arguments). Moreover, the State presented\\n\\nevidence apart from the rap video—the surveillance recordings and\\n\\ntestimony from two security guards—to establish Baker’s alleged\\n\\nmotive to shoot toward the security guards because he believed that\\n\\nthey had “disrespected” him. See Olds, \\n299 Ga. at\\n76 & n.15.\\n\\n     Finally, the rap music video’s probative value to prove that\\n\\nBaker had access to the guns used during the shooting was, at most,\\n\\ntrivial. We acknowledge that because there was no proof connecting\\n\\nBaker to the guns used in the shooting, which the evidence indicated\\n\\nwere a .45-caliber gun of an undetermined make and model and a\\n\\nSmith & Wesson 9mm pistol, the State had a real need to tie Baker\\n\\nto those guns. But the rap music video tended to prove little, if\\n\\nanything, about Baker’s access to those types of guns near the time\\n\\nof the shooting. First, although Baker claimed in his pretrial motion\\n\\nto exclude the video that it was “filmed in early 2019,” the State\\n\\noffered no evidence at trial about when the performance was\\n\\nrecorded, which reduced the video’s probative force to prove that\\n\\n                                 31\\n Baker had access to guns near the time of the shooting in July 2019.\\n\\nAnd the State did not argue at trial or present any evidence showing\\n\\nthat the gun Baker waved around in the rap music video was used,\\n\\nor even could have been used, in the shooting. The only evidence\\n\\npresented at trial about the gun Baker held in the rap music video\\n\\nwas Dunn’s testimony that he did not know the gun’s type (or even\\n\\nwhether it was real or fake) and Baker’s similar testimony that the\\n\\ngun was not his, he did not know its type, he thought it was “a\\n\\nGlock,” and he used it in the performance “to look cool.” Thus, the\\n\\nrap video established only that at some unidentified point in time,\\n\\nBaker held what may have been a Glock handgun during a rap\\n\\nmusic performance.      See Olds, \\n299 Ga. at 75\\n (explaining that\\n\\n“‘[p]robative value refers to the strength of the connection between\\n\\nthe evidence and what it is offered to prove’”) (citation omitted).\\n\\nCompare Wilson v. State, \\n315 Ga. 728\\n, 739-740 (\\n883 SE2d 802\\n)\\n\\n(2023) (holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion under\\n\\nRule 403 by admitting into evidence a rap music video that was\\n\\nfilmed 11 days after the victim’s murder and showed the appellant’s\\n\\n                                  32\\n co-defendants “flash[ing]” a handgun that two witnesses testified\\n\\nwas the murder weapon); United States v.

See United States\\nv. Gamory, 635 F3d 480, 493 (11th Cir. 2011) (explaining that a rap video was\\nminimally probative under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 because there was no\\nproof that the appellant “authored the lyrics or that the views and values\\nreflected in the video were, in fact, adopted or shared by [the appellant]”); State\\nv. Skinner, \\n218 N.J. 496\\n, 521 (95 A3d 236) (2014) (“The difficulty in identifying\\nprobative value in fictional or other forms of artistic self-expressive endeavors\\nis that one cannot presume that, simply because an author has chosen to write\\nabout certain topics, he or she has acted in accordance with those views.”);\\nCommonwealth v.

As the trial court noted in discussing\\n\\nthe rap music video at trial (outside the presence of the jury), “the\\n\\nvideo [was] . . . glorifying of violence and gun violence and a sort of\\n\\nstreet life, glamorizing it.”\\n\\n     Yet the record shows that the trial court’s failure to recognize\\n\\nthe danger of unfair prejudice from the video when it ruled on its\\n\\nadmissibility enabled the State’s improper use of the video\\n\\nthroughout the trial.     In particular, the trial court allowed the\\n\\nprosecutor to capitalize on the video’s prejudicial impact by\\n\\nemphasizing the video not to prove the purposes for which the State\\n\\nnow asserts the video was probative (i.e., to complete the story of the\\n\\ncrime, to establish Baker’s identity, to show Baker’s motive, or to\\n\\nprove that Baker had access to the guns used in the shooting), but\\n\\nfor the purpose of showing Baker’s alleged propensity for violence\\n\\nbased on the theory that he was associated with a rap artist. For\\n\\nexample, when examining Dunn, the lead detective, and Baker, the\\n\\n                                  34\\n prosecutor emphasized the portion of the rap video in which Baker\\n\\nwaved a handgun, and she asked Dunn and Baker about the video’s\\n\\n“promoting” gun violence—even though she did not offer argument,\\n\\nlet alone evidence, that the gun shown in the video was the gun used\\n\\nin the shooting. And when the prosecutor asked Baker whether the\\n\\nentourage traveled with guns and he responded, “Why would we,\\n\\nthough,” she again used the video to exaggerate Baker’s violent\\n\\nnature, saying “Well, let’s see why,” before she played the video for\\n\\nthe jury a third time. Even worse, during closing argument, the\\n\\nprosecutor expressly asserted that the rap music video proved that\\n\\nthose who participate in making rap music, such as Baker, had a\\n\\npropensity for violence, saying, “Go back to that Ghetto Angels\\n\\nvideo. Right? That’s all they know, the gun violence. They want to\\n\\npromote it.” The prosecutor then drew a comparison between the\\n\\nshooting and the rap music video, stating, “[I]t’s not a game, it’s not\\n\\nabout a rap video. It’s real.” See, e.g., Brown v. State, \\n303 Ga. 158\\n,\\n\\n162-163 (\\n810 SE2d 145\\n) (2018) (explaining that the probative value\\n\\nof evidence that the appellant committed a prior aggravated assault\\n\\n                                  35\\n was “extremely low at best” and was “‘substantially outweighed by\\n\\nits danger of creating prejudice,’” because the evidence had “‘no\\n\\npurpose other than to show appellant’s propensity toward violence’”)\\n\\n(citation omitted). 17\\n\\n     The unfair prejudice from the evidence of the rap music video\\n\\nsubstantially outweighed its minimal probative value, making this\\n\\nevidence the sort that Rule 403 was meant to exclude: “matter of\\n\\nscant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the\\n\\nsake of its prejudicial effect.” Harris, 314 Ga. at 277 (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). The trial court therefore abused its discretion\\n\\nunder Rule 403 by admitting the rap music video into evidence. See\\n\\nid. at 274-280 (holding that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nunder Rule 403 by admitting evidence of the appellant’s sexual\\n\\nactivities on the day before the victim’s death, which had “trivial\\n\\nprobative value” and was “very prejudicial”); Jackson v. State, 306\\n\\n\\n     17 The dissenting opinion says in passing that it does “not condone the\\n\\nprosecutor’s potential misuse of the video to make a propensity argument.”\\nBut it undermines that disavowal by focusing on the amount of time the rap\\nmusic video was shown to the jurors instead of on the significantly harmful\\nways the prosecutor used the video even when it was not being played.\\n                                    36\\nGa. 69\\n, 79-80 (\\n829 SE2d 142\\n) (2019) (holding that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion under the Rule 403 part of the test pursuant to\\n\\nOCGA § 24-4-404 (b) by admitting evidence that the appellant was\\n\\ninvolved in a prior shooting, because the probative value of the\\n\\nevidence was “minimal at best”; it was “undoubtedly prejudicial”;\\n\\nand the prosecutor enhanced the prejudice by extensively\\n\\nquestioning the appellant about the prior shooting to try to establish\\n\\nthat he was “someone with a violent character”). See also United\\n\\nStates v. Gamory, 635 F3d 480, 493 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that\\n\\nthe trial court abused its discretion under Federal Rule of Evidence\\n\\n403 by admitting evidence of a rap music video and explaining that\\n\\n“the probative value of the rap video was minimal at best,” partly\\n\\nbecause any facts that the video made more probable “were not\\n\\nseriously contested at the time the video was introduced” and there\\n\\nwas no evidence that the appellant adopted the “views and values\\n\\nreflected in the video,” while “the substance of the rap video was\\n\\nheavily prejudicial,” as the lyrics “could reasonably be understood as\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 37\\n promoting a violent and unlawful lifestyle”).18\\n\\n\\n\\n      18 The dissenting opinion concludes that the admission of the rap music\\n\\nvideo was not an abuse of discretion under Rule 403, asserting that we have\\noverestimated the unfair prejudice from the video and downplayed its\\nprobative value. In determining that the video was not overly prejudicial, the\\ndissenting opinion ignores the prosecutor’s repeated questions and arguments\\nabout the video’s (and Baker’s) “promoting” gun violence, which improperly\\nemphasized Baker’s alleged propensity for violence. And the dissent’s\\nassertion that, by considering the prosecutor’s improper closing arguments\\nabout the rap music video in assessing unfair prejudice, we have “conflate[d]\\nthe question of unfair prejudice under Rule 403 with the question of whether\\nthe video, in the context of the entire trial, was harmful or harmless,” is simply\\nincorrect. In weighing probative value and unfair prejudice under Rule 403, a\\ntrial court should consider how the evidence at issue might be used within the\\ncontext of the evidence and arguments presented at trial, including how a\\nprosecutor could capitalize on the prejudicial effect of the evidence during\\nclosing argument. And in reviewing whether a trial court abused its discretion\\nin conducting 403’s balancing test, an appellate court may properly consider\\nwhether the risk of unfair prejudice was actualized at trial. See, e.g., Whited\\nv. State, \\n315 Ga. 598\\n, 605-606 (\\n883 SE2d 342\\n) (2023) (noting, in considering\\nunfair prejudice under Rule 403, that the State’s opening statements and\\nclosing arguments did not focus on the evidence at issue); Harris, 314 Ga. at\\n273-280 (noting the trial court’s pretrial ruling admitting evidence of the\\nappellant’s sexual messages and conduct under Rule 403 and then, in\\nconcluding that the court abused its discretion, considering all of the evidence\\npresented at trial—including the State’s theory at trial of the appellant’s\\nmotive; whether the evidence at issue was needlessly cumulative of other\\nevidence presented at trial; the probative value of the evidence, in light of the\\nother strong evidence presented at trial that proved the same point; and the\\nunfair prejudice flowing from the evidence at trial, which was “compound[ed]”\\nby the fact that the prosecutor hinted during his closing argument that the\\nappellant had not been charged with any crimes related to the evidence that\\nhe sent sexual messages to a child); Jackson, \\n306 Ga. at 78-79\\n (holding that\\nthe trial court abused its discretion under the Rule 403 part of the test\\npursuant to OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) by admitting evidence that the appellant was\\ninvolved in a prior shooting, and evaluating as part of that analysis the State’s\\nneed for the evidence—given the other evidence presented at trial—and its\\n\\n                                       38\\n       (d) Harm\\n\\n      Having concluded that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nunder Rule 403 by admitting the excerpt of the rap video into\\n\\nevidence, we must now assess whether that error caused harm that\\n\\nwarrants a reversal of Baker’s conviction. “‘The test for determining\\n\\nnonconstitutional harmless error is whether it is highly probable\\n\\n\\n\\nprejudicial effect—which was “enhanced” by the prosecutor’s extensively\\nquestioning the appellant about the shooting for the purpose of “establish[ing\\nthe appellant] as someone with a violent character”); Kirby, \\n304 Ga. at 486\\n\\n(concluding that the trial court abused its discretion under the Rule 403 part\\nof the test pursuant to OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) by admitting evidence that the\\nappellant committed a prior armed robbery and aggravated assault, and\\ndiscussing as part of that analysis its low probative value in light of the other\\nstrong evidence presented at trial to prove the same point and its prejudicial\\neffect, which was “reduced” because the jury was presented with other evidence\\nthat the appellant had committed another assault and robbery).\\n       As to the dissenting opinion’s assessment that the video’s probative\\nvalue was more significant than we acknowledge because the video “showed\\nthat Baker was familiar and comfortable with handguns,” we have explained\\ntime and again that when evidence is not particularly strong to prove the point\\nfor which it is offered, the probative value of the evidence is diminished, not\\nincreased. See, e.g., Olds, \\n299 Ga. at 75-76\\n. Here, the State did not use the\\nvideo to connect the gun used in the crimes to the gun Baker held in the video,\\nso the video was not strong evidence and had little probative value in that\\nrespect.\\n       In sum, the dissent misses the point: the contents of the video, standing\\nalone, were not particularly prejudicial. But the video’s exceedingly low\\nprobative value, compared to its outsized risk of unfair prejudice, made its\\nadmission an abuse of discretion under Rule 403. And indeed, that risk—\\nwhich was apparent at the time the trial court had to decide whether to admit\\nthe video—was actualized by the prosecutor’s improper use of the video to show\\nBaker’s propensity for gun violence.\\n                                       39\\n that the error did not contribute to the verdict.’” Jivens v. State,\\n\\nCase No. S23A1078, \\n2023 WL 8721065\\n, at *4 (decided Dec. 19, 2023)\\n\\n(citation omitted).

Applying that standard, we conclude that the\\n\\ntrial court’s error in this case was not harmless.\\n\\n     As discussed above, the rap music video was highly prejudicial.\\n\\nIt allowed the State to introduce impermissible propensity evidence\\n\\nby portraying Baker as a threatening gunman, and the prosecutor\\n\\nseverely exacerbated the video’s prejudicial impact by emphasizing\\n\\nthat it showed Baker’s predisposition to gun violence. Although the\\n\\nvideo excerpt was relatively brief—it was only about 30-seconds long\\n\\n(as the trial court pointed out in its order denying Baker’s motion\\n\\nfor new trial)—the prosecutor made it a focal point of the trial. She\\n\\nplayed the video for the jury three times at three different points\\n\\nduring the trial; questioned three witnesses about the video\\n\\n(specifically highlighting that the video advocated gun violence); and\\n\\n                                  40\\n then emphasized during her closing argument that Baker and other\\n\\nrap artists “promote[d]” gun violence, because “[t]hat’s all they\\n\\nknow,” a pointed argument that reinforced to the jury Baker’s\\n\\nalleged violent character. See, e.g., Strong v. State, \\n309 Ga. 295\\n, 317\\n\\n(\\n845 SE2d 653\\n) (2020) (noting, in reversing the appellant’s\\n\\nconvictions on the ground that an evidentiary error was not\\n\\nharmless, that the State “emphasized” the evidence during closing\\n\\nargument); Thompson v. State, \\n302 Ga. 533\\n, 542 (\\n807 SE2d 899\\n)\\n\\n(2017) (explaining, in reversing the appellant’s convictions due to\\n\\nthe improper admission of evidence that was not harmless, that the\\n\\nprosecution emphasized during closing argument that the evidence\\n\\nshowed that the appellant had a propensity to commit crimes).19\\n\\n\\n      19 We note that the trial court instructed the jury during the final charge\\n\\nthat the lawyers’ closing arguments were not evidence, but under these\\ncircumstances, that generalized instruction was not sufficient to cure the\\nprejudicial impact of the prosecutor’s improper propensity argument. Cf. Jones\\nv. State, \\n292 Ga. 656\\n, 662 (\\n740 SE2d 590\\n) (2013) (explaining that the standard\\ninstruction that closing arguments are not evidence was insufficient to cure\\nthe prosecutor’s “highly prejudicial” improper argument that the appellant was\\ninvolved in another shooting, which was not supported by any evidence at trial,\\nin violation of OCGA § 17-8-75).\\n       In addition, the State contends that other aspects of the trial mitigated\\nany harm from the admission of the video: namely, that in response to the\\n\\n                                       41\\n       Moreover, other than the improperly admitted evidence of the\\n\\nrap music video, the State offered no connection between Baker and\\n\\nguns. The State introduced no evidence showing that Baker carried\\n\\nor had access to guns regularly, much less that he was carrying a\\n\\ngun on the night of the shooting or that the gun displayed in the rap\\n\\nvideo was used in the shooting. In short, the way in which the rap\\n\\nmusic video was used at trial aggrandized a connection between\\n\\nBaker and gun violence that was not properly established by any\\n\\nother evidence. Under these circumstances, the evidence of the rap\\n\\n\\n\\nprosecutor’s questions during jury selection about whether potential jurors had\\nheard about rap artists committing crimes and whether that would “color\\n[their] perception” of the case, no jurors expressed any bias, and that defense\\ncounsel elicited testimony indicating, and asserted during closing argument,\\nthat the video was a performance that merely showed Baker “wanting to act\\ncool.” We disagree. The jurors’ general attitudes toward rap artists at the time\\nof jury selection says little, if anything, about how they responded to the\\nprosecutor’s belaboring of the improperly admitted evidence of the rap music\\nvideo at trial. See Hill v. State, \\n308 Ga. 638\\n, 648 (\\n842 SE2d 853\\n) (2020)\\n(explaining that although the jurors stated during jury selection that they\\ncould remain impartial even though the appellant was visibly shackled during\\nthe trial, at that point in the proceedings, they could “only speculate” as to how\\nthey would feel after being exposed to the practice; accordingly, the jurors’\\nstatements did not render the trial court’s error in requiring the appellant to\\nbe shackled at trial harmless). As to the testimony and argument that the\\nvideo simply showed Baker’s attempt “to act cool,” we acknowledge that\\ndefense counsel’s response to the video reduced its harmful effect, but that\\nslight mitigation was outweighed by the prosecutor’s repeated and improper\\nuse of the video to show Baker’s alleged propensity for gun violence.\\n                                       42\\n music video was not “‘relatively benign’ or merely cumulative, as we\\n\\noften have concluded in cases deeming improperly admitted\\n\\nevidence harmless.”     Harris, 314 Ga. at 284 (citation omitted).\\n\\nCompare Jivens, \\n2023 WL 8721065\\n, at *5 (explaining that the\\n\\nallegedly improper admission of photographs of the appellant with\\n\\nfirearms was harmless, partly because “any prejudicial effect these\\n\\nphotographs may have had was minimized by properly admitted\\n\\nevidence that [the appellant], in fact, had access to guns”).\\n\\n     By contrast, the      other evidence     showing that      Baker\\n\\nparticipated in shooting Head was not especially compelling,\\n\\nespecially given the equivocation of multiple witnesses. See Harris,\\n\\n314 Ga. at 284 (explaining that “‘compelling properly admitted\\n\\nevidence of guilt’” may offset a high risk of prejudice from improperly\\n\\nadmitted evidence) (citation omitted). See also OCGA §§ 16-5-1 (a)\\n\\n(defining malice murder); 16-2-20 (defining parties to a crime). As\\n\\nwe recounted in Division 1 above, only one eyewitness—Orr-\\n\\nOglesby—identified Baker as a shooter, and although she said\\n\\nduring her interviews with the lead detective that she saw two\\n\\n                                  43\\n shooters, provided a description of one of the shooters that matched\\n\\nBaker, and then identified Baker during her interview with the\\n\\ndetective in August 2019 and again at trial, she also said during her\\n\\nAugust 2019 interview that she “d[id]n’t think the light-skinned\\n\\nguy” (referring to Baker) was a shooter. Moreover, evidence was\\n\\npresented that after that interview and at the time of trial, Orr-\\n\\nOglesby had a motive to testify against Baker, because she had\\n\\nrecently been arrested on several criminal charges that were still\\n\\npending, which authorized the jury to make additional inferences\\n\\nthat might undermine Orr-Oglesby’s credibility.\\n\\n     The State points out that Orr-Oglesby’s account at trial was\\n\\nsupported by other evidence—including the surveillance recordings\\n\\nshowing Baker (in a white shirt) and the man in the camouflage cap\\n\\n(in a black shirt) walking together toward the pawn shop; testimony\\n\\nthat patrons saw a man in a white shirt walking with a man in a\\n\\nblack shirt toward the pawn shop, saying something like, “we gonna\\n\\nget them,” moments before the shooting; and the shell casings near\\n\\nthe pawn shop, which indicated that two guns were used in the\\n\\n                                 44\\n shooting.   Notably, however, Orr-Oglesby’s account was also\\n\\ncontradicted by other evidence. Orr-Oglesby testified that Baker\\n\\nand the man in the camouflage cap shot and then fled in a van that\\n\\nwas parked on the side of the strip mall, but Dunn testified that he\\n\\ndid not see anyone get into the entourage’s van, which had been\\n\\nparked behind the strip mall, after he heard gunshots. Moreover, in\\n\\ncontrast to Orr-Oglesby’s testimony, the off-duty police officer told\\n\\ninvestigators at the crime scene that he saw a shooter (with no\\n\\nmention of a second shooter) wearing a light shirt and a ball cap.\\n\\nAnd although the ballistics evidence showed that two guns were shot\\n\\nnear the pawn shop, witnesses testified that they also heard another\\n\\nset of gunshots; the defense presented evidence that shots were fired\\n\\nfrom three vehicles (the descriptions of which did not match the\\n\\nentourage’s van) near the nightclub around the time of the shooting;\\n\\ninvestigators found several additional shell casings in that area; and\\n\\nthe State presented no evidence of the type of bullet that killed\\n\\nHead.\\n\\n     To be sure, the State presented substantial evidence of Baker’s\\n\\n                                 45\\n motive to participate in the shooting: namely, that he and the man\\n\\nin the camouflage cap were angry with the security guards after the\\n\\nfight. But Baker did not dispute that he and the man in the cap\\n\\nfought with the guards or that he was angry. And to rebut the\\n\\nState’s theory that his anger motivated him to perpetrate a shooting\\n\\nwith the man in the cap, Baker provided a not-implausible account:\\n\\nafter the fight, he simply parted ways with the man—whom he did\\n\\nnot know and whose presence he wanted to leave, given that the\\n\\nman had escalated the fight—and got in the van, where he then\\n\\nheard gunshots.20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      20 The dissenting opinion contends that our harmless-error analysis is\\n\\n“incomplete because it fails to account for the fact that Baker elected to testify\\nat his trial,” which it suggests would diminish the harm of the error in\\nadmitting the rap video because “the jury did not find [Baker] credible.” But\\nwe have accounted for Baker’s testimony above, concluding that his version of\\nthe events on the night of the shooting was not implausible. Although the jury\\nwas authorized to disbelieve Baker’s account, we would expect that the\\nprosecutor’s repeated use of the video to emphasize Baker’s alleged propensity\\nfor gun violence would have significantly undermined his credibility with the\\njurors. In other words, the prosecutor’s use of the video to emphatically cast\\nBaker as a violent gunman before the jury had an opportunity to listen to\\nBaker’s own account and assess his credibility made it more likely that the jury\\nwould disbelieve Baker’s testimony not because it was unworthy of belief, but\\nbecause he had been portrayed as the sort of person who would commit a crime\\nlike the one with which he was charged.\\n                                       46\\n      Given all of this evidence, we cannot say that it is “highly\\n\\nprobable” that the trial court’s improper admission of the evidence\\n\\nof the rap music video did not contribute to the guilty verdict, and\\n\\nthus the State has not met its burden of showing that the error was\\n\\nharmless. We therefore reverse Baker’s malice murder conviction.\\n\\nSee, e.g., Harris, 314 Ga. at 288-289 (reversing the appellant’s\\n\\nconvictions due to the improper admission of evidence under Rule\\n\\n403, which was not harmless, because the evidence was highly\\n\\nprejudicial and the proof of the appellant’s guilt “was not\\n\\n‘overwhelming,’ ‘compelling,’ or even strong”); Strong, 309 Ga. at\\n\\n316-318 (reversing the appellant’s convictions on the ground that\\n\\nimproperly admitted evidence was not harmless, because the\\n\\nevidence was highly prejudicial and not cumulative of other,\\n\\nproperly admitted evidence; the State emphasized the evidence at\\n\\ntrial; and the other evidence of the appellant’s guilt was “not\\n\\noverwhelming,” particularly given that the State’s two eyewitnesses\\n\\ngave somewhat inconsistent accounts of the murder and the\\n\\nappellant “provided a not-outlandish account of the incident”);\\n\\n                                47\\n Heard v. State, \\n309 Ga. 76\\n, 91 (\\n844 SE2d 791\\n) (2020) (reversing the\\n\\nappellant’s convictions based on improperly admitted evidence that\\n\\nwas not harmless, because the evidence was “highly prejudicial and\\n\\nnot at all cumulative . . . and the evidence that [the appellant]\\n\\ncommitted the charged crimes was not compelling”). 21\\n\\n    Judgment reversed. All the Justices concur, except Boggs, C.J.,\\nand LaGrua, J., who dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      21 Although the evidence presented at trial was not especially strong,\\n\\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to the verdicts, it was constitutionally\\nsufficient to sustain the jury’s guilty verdicts. See Jackson v. Virginia, \\n443\\nU.S. 307\\n, 319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979); Hamilton v. State, \\n317 Ga.\\n337\\n, 340 (\\n893 SE2d 54\\n) (2023) (concluding that the evidence, which showed\\nthat the appellant initiated a dispute with the victim and then participated\\nwith his co-defendant in shooting him, was constitutionally sufficient to\\nsupport the appellant’s conviction for felony murder based on aggravated\\nassault); Draughn v. State, \\n311 Ga. 378\\n, 381-382 (\\n858 SE2d 8\\n) (2021) (holding\\nthat the evidence supporting the appellants’ convictions for malice murder was\\nconstitutionally sufficient, partly because an eyewitness identified them as the\\nassailants, and explaining that although there was conflicting evidence as to\\ntheir involvement, “‘[i]t is the jury’s role to resolve conflicts in the evidence and\\nto determine the credibility of witnesses, and the resolution of such conflicts\\nadversely to the defendant does not render the evidence insufficient’”) (citation\\nomitted). Thus, the State may retry Baker if it so chooses. See Harris, 314 Ga.\\nat 289; Strong, 309 Ga. at 318 n.25.\\n                                         48\\n        LAGRUA, Justice, dissenting.\\n\\n       The majority opinion holds that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion by admitting the 33-second clip from a rap music video\\n\\ninto    evidence   because   the   video’s   “probative    value   [was]\\n\\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice[.]” OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-4-403. Under such circumstances, reversal is only necessary if\\n\\nthe error was harmful, which the majority opinion also holds. I\\n\\ndisagree as to both. The trial court did not err in admitting the video,\\n\\nbut, even if it did, any error was harmless. Because I would affirm\\n\\nthe judgment of the trial court, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n       It is uncontested—even admitted by Baker and captured on\\n\\ncamera—that Baker and a man in a camouflage cap attempted to\\n\\nreenter the nightclub shortly after 2:00 a.m., but they were denied\\n\\nreentry after a brief argument and physical struggle with the\\n\\nsecurity guards. Baker and the man in the camouflage cap walked\\n\\naway in the direction of a pawn shop, with Baker placing his arm\\n\\naround the man in the camouflage cap. Uncontested evidence also\\n\\nshows that one of those security guards near the door was shot and\\n\\n                                   49\\n killed minutes later. At least five witnesses testified that the gunfire\\n\\ncame from the direction of the pawn shop, where shell casings were\\n\\nalso found. Surveillance footage did not capture the shooting, but\\n\\nOrr-Oglesby testified that she saw two men matching the\\n\\ndescriptions of Baker and the man in the camouflage cap both\\n\\nshooting guns toward the nightclub from the direction of the pawn\\n\\nshop. Another nightclub patron testified that she saw two men\\n\\nwalking toward the pawn shop, one with his arm around the other,\\n\\nand she heard one say, “We gonna get them,” followed shortly by\\n\\ngunfire. Baker testified that, by the time the shooting started, he\\n\\nhad already parted with the man in the camouflage cap and boarded\\n\\nthe van. However, no other witnesses, including Dunn, could\\n\\ncorroborate that Baker was in the van before the shooting.\\n\\nAccordingly, the majority opinion concludes that this evidence was\\n\\nconstitutionally sufficient to support Baker’s conviction. Majority\\n\\nOp. at 48 n.21.\\n\\n     But the majority opinion also holds that all this evidence “was\\n\\nnot especially compelling.” Majority Op. at 43. I do not agree; rather,\\n\\n                                  50\\n the evidence against Baker was substantial. To support its contrary\\n\\nholding,   the    majority    opinion    undermines      Orr-Oglesby’s\\n\\nidentification of Baker as the shooter by listing multiple instances\\n\\nin which she identified Baker as the shooter but one instance where\\n\\nshe equivocated. However, the majority opinion also acknowledges\\n\\nthat the core of her testimony was largely consistent with other\\n\\nuncontested evidence. She heard some commotion at the front door\\n\\nof the nightclub and then saw two men near the pawn shop shooting\\n\\ntoward the nightclub—two men that were identified at trial as\\n\\nBaker and the man in the camouflage cap. The inconsistencies\\n\\nhighlighted by the majority opinion generally do not contradict that\\n\\nnarrative, except for the testimony of an off-duty police officer at the\\n\\nscene, who testified that he “couldn’t get a good sight of any\\n\\nshooters” and could barely remember what he saw. The majority\\n\\nopinion also explains that Orr-Oglesby had a motive to lie because\\n\\nshe was on probation and was recently arrested on a bench warrant\\n\\nfor a completely unrelated misdemeanor in a separate county, a\\n\\nmotive which I find weak and irrelevant considering that she was\\n\\n                                  51\\n not facing those charges during her prior identification of Baker.\\n\\n     Now to the question on appeal: did the trial court abuse its\\n\\ndiscretion by admitting the video under Rule 403, and, if so, was it\\n\\nharmful error? The majority opinion answers “yes” to both questions\\n\\nfor roughly the same reason: “the rap music video was highly\\n\\nprejudicial.” Majority Op. at 40. I disagree.\\n\\n     I do not agree that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially\\n\\noutweighed the video’s probative value, which is the difficult test\\n\\nthat Rule 403 sets out. The video was not as prejudicial as the\\n\\nmajority opinion holds. “[I]n reviewing issues under Rule 403, we\\n\\nlook at the evidence in a light most favorable to its admission,\\n\\nmaximizing its probative value and minimizing its undue\\n\\nprejudicial impact.” Lee v. State, ___ Ga. ___, ___ (4) (___ SE2d ___)\\n\\n(Case No. S23A1034) (February 6, 2024) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). The 33-second clip simply shows Baker and others singing,\\n\\nsmiling, dancing on a car, and waving around handguns, with Baker\\n\\nremoving and inserting an extended magazine. The video was not\\n\\nparticularly offensive or unusual. “A defendant’s appearance in a\\n\\n                                  52\\n rap video . . . is not per se prejudicial.” Wilson, 315 Ga. at 739 (8) (a).\\n\\nThis is true even when the video is “replete with obscenities and\\n\\nracial slurs.” Id. But here, the lyrics were largely undecipherable,\\n\\nsee Majority Op. at 21-22 n.13, further diminishing any danger of\\n\\nunfair prejudice. Cf. Gamory, 635 F3d at 493 (holding that the\\n\\n“substance of the rap video was heavily prejudicial” because the\\n\\nlyrics “could reasonably be understood as promoting a violent and\\n\\nunlawful lifestyle”).\\n\\n     The real issue garnering the majority opinion’s focus is the\\n\\nState’s use of the video once admitted. The video was played three\\n\\ntimes: first during Dunn’s testimony, second during the lead\\n\\ndetective’s testimony, and last during Baker’s testimony. However,\\n\\neach time, the video was used for a permitted purpose. In context,\\n\\nDunn and Bakers’ testimony regarding the video focused on gun\\n\\nownership, and the detective’s testimony focused on how he\\n\\nidentified Baker as the shooter.\\n\\n     The prosecutor also briefly referenced the video twice in her\\n\\nclosing argument, with one reference merely in passing. Baker did\\n\\n                                    53\\n not object to either reference and does not raise the closing\\n\\nargument’s impropriety on appeal. Baker has thus waived his right\\n\\nto raise an independent claim that the prosecutor made an improper\\n\\npropensity argument in closing. See Gates v. State, \\n298 Ga. 324\\n, 328-\\n\\n329 (4) (\\n781 SE2d 772\\n) (2016). Moreover, when the trial court ruled\\n\\non the admissibility of the video, it could not possibly have factored\\n\\nthe prosecutor’s later closing argument into its evaluation of\\n\\nprejudice under Rule 403. While trial courts certainly must consider\\n\\nthe danger of unfair prejudice inherent to the contested evidence, we\\n\\nshould not fault the trial court for failing to predict that the State\\n\\nwill turn around and openly and intentionally use that evidence for\\n\\nimproper purposes. The trial court should be able to make rulings\\n\\nwith the understanding that the State will later follow the rules of\\n\\nevidence. I still disagree with the majority opinion on how much\\n\\ndanger of unfair prejudice the video presented. But I do not calculate\\n\\nin how the State’s eventual and actual use of the video impacted the\\n\\nverdict. That is more appropriately—and more commonly—a part of\\n\\nthe harmless-error analysis. See, e.g., Morrell v. State, \\n313 Ga. 247\\n,\\n\\n                                 54\\n 261-262 (2) (\\n869 SE2d 447\\n) (2022) (considering State’s mentions of\\n\\nprior act evidence in closing arguments when assessing harmless\\n\\nerror).\\n\\n     But by focusing on the State’s closing argument in the unfair\\n\\nprejudice analysis, the majority opinion appears to conflate the\\n\\nquestion of unfair prejudice under Rule 403 with the question of\\n\\nwhether the video, in the context of the entire trial, was harmful or\\n\\nharmless. Perhaps we have not been so careful to maintain this\\n\\ndivision in our past decisions regarding Rule 403 prejudice. See, e.g.,\\n\\nWhited v. State, \\n315 Ga. 598\\n, 606 (3) (\\n883 SE2d 342\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(affirming trial court’s admission of evidence under Rule 403, in part\\n\\nby explaining “it is noteworthy in considering the extent of any\\n\\nunfair prejudice that the State’s opening and closing statements did\\n\\nnot focus” on the evidence in question, but, in support, only citing\\n\\ncases doing the same in their harmless-error analyses). But we have\\n\\nalways maintained that exclusion under Rule 403 is an\\n\\n“extraordinary remedy which should be used only sparingly . . . .” Id.\\n\\nat 605 (citation and punctuation omitted). The initial admission or\\n\\n                                  55\\n exclusion of the evidence itself, often done before the trial even\\n\\nbegins, is its own consideration. Here, when the trial court made its\\n\\nruling to admit the video, it was properly focused on the video\\n\\nitself—not what the State might argue in closing. See Wilson, 315\\n\\nGa. at 739 (8) (a) (explaining that the question is “what specifically\\n\\nabout this video might cause unfair prejudice) (emphasis in\\n\\noriginal).\\n\\n     I also disagree with the majority opinion’s holding regarding\\n\\nthe video’s probative value. For example, I do not agree that the\\n\\nvideo’s probative value to prove access to the guns was “trivial.”\\n\\nMajority Op. at 31. The State offered no connection between Baker\\n\\nand guns other than the video. The video showed that Baker was\\n\\nfamiliar and comfortable with handguns, which was probative to a\\n\\ncritical part of the State’s case. Regarding the other permissible uses\\n\\nof the video, the majority opinion only notes other trial evidence,\\n\\nincluding Baker’s testimony, that served a similar purpose as the\\n\\nvideo, potentially diminishing its probity. However, I do not agree\\n\\nthat the video lost its probative value to the degree that majority\\n\\n                                  56\\n opinion holds. Accordingly, the danger of unfair prejudice did not\\n\\nsubstantially outweigh the video’s probative value here. The video\\n\\nwas more probative and less prejudicial than the majority opinion\\n\\nholds.\\n\\n     Like the Rule 403 standard, the test for harmless error is also\\n\\ndifficult to meet, as we must determine “whether it is highly\\n\\nprobable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.” Jivens, ___\\n\\nGa. at ___ (2) (citation omitted; emphasis supplied). I do not condone\\n\\nthe prosecutor’s potential misuse of the video to make a propensity\\n\\nargument, but she did not make “it a focal point of the trial.”\\n\\nMajority Op. at 40. Ultimately, this case involved 19 witnesses—\\n\\nincluding Baker himself and someone who actually saw the\\n\\nshooting—and the trial transcript spans over 800 pages. The video\\n\\nwas played for a total of 99 seconds, and discussion of the video took\\n\\nup only a few minutes of the four-day trial—a trial, as I have\\n\\nexplained, in which substantial evidence of Baker’s guilt was\\n\\npresented to the jury. Further, testimony by Baker and Dunn put\\n\\nthe video in a performative context and explained that it was made\\n\\n                                  57\\n in memory of a family member lost to gun violence. This helped\\n\\nmitigate whatever harm the video may have caused.\\n\\n     The majority opinion’s harmless error analysis is also\\n\\nincomplete because it fails to account for the fact that Baker elected\\n\\nto testify at his trial, and the jury did not find him credible. See\\n\\nUnited States v. Phyfier, \\n842 F. Appx. 333\\n, 338 (11th Cir. 2021) (per\\n\\ncuriam) (explaining that, in the harmless error context, “it is well\\n\\nestablished that when a defendant testifies in his own defense, the\\n\\njury may disbelieve his testimony, conclude that the opposite of his\\n\\ntestimony is true, and consider it as substantive evidence of his\\n\\nguilt”). See also Fitts v. State, \\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 144 n.9 (\\n859 SE2d 79\\n)\\n\\n(2021) (“If disbelieved by the jury, [defendant’s] testimony denying\\n\\nher involvement in the crime could have served as direct evidence of\\n\\nthe opposite proposition.”). For example, the jury was entitled to find\\n\\nthat, contrary to his trial testimony, Baker was not in the van at the\\n\\ntime of the shooting, but instead remained with the man in the\\n\\ncamouflage cap, and that Baker did have a gun that night and was\\n\\ninvolved in the shooting. Cf. Majority Opinion at 16.\\n\\n                                  58\\n      Thus, even if Rule 403 did merit exclusion, it is “highly\\n\\nprobable” that the video’s admission did not contribute to the\\n\\nverdict.

HOOKS v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PINSON, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Kiervon Armani Hooks was convicted of felony mur-\\n\\nder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony,\\n\\nboth arising from the shooting death of Brandon Ray Foster.1 On\\n\\nappeal, Hooks contends the evidence was not sufficient to sustain\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 Foster was shot in the late hours of September 26, 2017, and died early\\n\\nthe next morning. On December 18, 2017, a grand jury returned an indictment\\ncharging Hooks with aggravated assault (Count 1), felony murder predicated\\non aggravated assault (Count 2), and possession of a firearm during the com-\\nmission of a felony (Count 3). At a jury trial from February 4-6, 2019, the jury\\nfound Hooks guilty of all counts. On February 6, 2019, the trial court sentenced\\nHooks to life without parole for felony murder (Count 2) and merged the ag-\\ngravated assault count into the felony murder conviction. Hooks was also sen-\\ntenced to serve five years in prison consecutive to his felony-murder sentence\\nfor possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Hooks, through\\ntrial counsel, filed a timely motion for new trial on February 11, 2019, which\\nhe amended through new counsel on April 13, 2023. Hooks waived hearing on\\nthe motion for new trial, and the trial court denied the motion on April 25,\\n2023. Hooks timely filed a notice of appeal on May 23, 2023. His appeal was\\ndocketed to the term of court beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a\\ndecision on the briefs.\\n his convictions because no physical evidence or eyewitness testi-\\n\\nmony linked him to the crime scene and the State did not present\\n\\nenough evidence to exclude the possibility that someone else shot\\n\\nFoster. But the evidence, which we recount in detail below, was con-\\n\\nstitutionally sufficient, so we affirm his convictions.\\n\\n     1. Near midnight on September 26, 2017, Dawn McCorkel was\\n\\ninside her apartment at the Garlington Heights apartment complex\\n\\nwhen she heard a gunshot “right next to [her] window.” She went\\n\\noutside five-to-ten minutes later, stepped off her porch, and saw\\n\\nsomeone was lying on the ground four-to-five feet away, on the left\\n\\nside of Building 60. She walked over to the person, Foster, whom she\\n\\nrecognized because he had been her neighbor for several years. Fos-\\n\\nter had been shot, but he was still alive, and McCorkel called 911.\\n\\n     Foster told McCorkel that “Buddha” shot him. McCorkel knew\\n\\nHooks as “Buddha.” She did not know anyone else who went by the\\n\\nnickname “Buddha,” although she said she had “heard of other peo-\\n\\nple in town with that nickname.” When Lieutenant Kylie Carter ar-\\n\\nrived at the scene, Foster was lying on the ground between\\n\\n                                   2\\n McCorkel’s apartment and Building 90 and had a gunshot wound to\\n\\nhis abdomen. Police found a spent .40-caliber shell casing near\\n\\nBuilding 90. McCorkel’s apartment was at the end of Building 60,\\n\\nwhich backed up to the rear of Building 90. Building 90 could be seen\\n\\nfrom McCorkel’s side window.\\n\\n     Lieutenant Carter asked Foster who shot him, and Foster said\\n\\n“Buddha.” Carter asked again, and Foster again said “Buddha” shot\\n\\nhim. The lead detective, Larry Hill, did not know who “Buddha” was\\n\\nat first. Another officer at the scene, Officer Matthew Brooks, knew\\n\\nthat Hooks, who used to be Officer Brooks’s neighbor at a different\\n\\napartment complex, now lived in Garlington Heights and went by\\n\\nthe nickname “Buddha.” Officer Brooks knew Hooks and his family\\n\\nand did not know anyone other than Hooks who went by the nick-\\n\\nname “Buddha.”\\n\\n     Although Officer Brooks did not know Hooks’s apartment num-\\n\\nber, he knew that Hooks’s sister lived in an apartment in Building\\n\\n90, which was the building the spent shell casing was found next to.\\n\\nOfficer Brooks went to that apartment, found the door was cracked\\n\\n                                 3\\n open, and knocked. Hooks answered the door and briefly spoke with\\n\\nBrooks. Hooks said that he had been inside his sister’s apartment\\n\\nall night, except for when he had stepped out to smoke a cigarette.\\n\\nPolice then searched the apartment but found no weapon.\\n\\n     Foster died from the gunshot wound to his abdomen later that\\n\\nnight. The medical examiner recovered a bullet that went through\\n\\nFoster’s abdomen and liver, then lodged in his right kidney and\\n\\nkilled him.\\n\\n     Brian Lepper, a GBI firearms and tool mark examiner, exam-\\n\\nined the shell casing collected at the scene and the bullet recovered\\n\\nduring Foster’s autopsy. Lepper determined that both were .40-cal-\\n\\niber and consistent with having been fired from a High Point .40-\\n\\ncaliber pistol or another brand of .40-caliber gun.\\n\\n     At trial, Detective Hill testified that Hooks was arrested for the\\n\\nshooting after investigators had exhausted other possible leads.\\n\\nMcCorkel, the neighbor who found Foster, identified Hooks in the\\n\\ncourtroom as the only person she personally knew as “Buddha” and\\n\\ntestified that it would have only taken “a second” to go from the\\n\\n                                  4\\n location where Foster was found to Building 90, where Hooks was\\n\\nthat night. Officer Brooks also identified Hooks in the courtroom as\\n\\nthe person he knew as “Buddha.” Also at trial, the State introduced\\n\\na to-scale computer-generated diagram of the crime scene, which\\n\\nhad been created based on measurements and photographs taken at\\n\\nthe crime scene. The photographs and diagram were admitted into\\n\\nevidence and an officer referenced them to point out the locations of\\n\\nBuildings 60 and 90, Foster, and the spent shell and their proximity\\n\\nto one another.\\n\\n     2. Hooks contends that the evidence was not sufficient to con-\\n\\nvict him of Foster’s murder because no physical evidence connected\\n\\nhim to the crime, and although Hooks went by the nickname “Bud-\\n\\ndha,” there was evidence that more than one person went by that\\n\\nnickname, and there was no evidence describing the shooter to es-\\n\\ntablish that Hooks—and not another “Buddha”—shot Foster.\\n\\n     (a) We review the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence by\\n\\nreviewing the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the ver-\\n\\ndicts to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found\\n\\n                                  5\\n the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, without weighing\\n\\nthe evidence or resolving conflicts in testimony. See Weems v. State,\\n\\n318 Ga. 98, 101 (2) (a) (897 SE2d 368) (2024) (citing Jackson v. Vir-\\n\\nginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979);\\n\\nByers v. State, 311 Ga. 259, 266 (2) (857 SE2d 447) (2021)). To meet\\n\\nits burden, the State was “not required to produce any physical evi-\\n\\ndence,” so long as there was “competent evidence” to prove each ele-\\n\\nment of the crime. See Johnson v. State, 296 Ga. 504, 505 (1) (769\\n\\nSE2d 87) (2015). We defer to the jury’s resolution of any conflicts in\\n\\nthe evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and the drawing of reason-\\n\\nable inferences from the facts. See Perkins v. State, 313 Ga. 885, 891\\n\\n(2) (a) (873 SE2d 185) (2022).\\n\\n     A person commits felony murder when, “in the commission of\\n\\na felony, he or she causes the death of another human being irre-\\n\\nspective of malice.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (c). Here, the predicate felony\\n\\nwas aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, which occurs when\\n\\nsomeone “[a]ttempts to commit a violent injury” to another or “[c]om-\\n\\nmits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of\\n\\n                                  6\\n immediately receiving a violent injury” by use of a “deadly weapon.”\\n\\nOCGA §§ 16-5-20 (a), 16-5-21 (a) (2).\\n\\n     The evidence here, although largely circumstantial, authorized\\n\\nthe jury to convict Hooks of these offenses. Hooks points out that the\\n\\nmurder weapon was not found, and no witnesses saw Hooks outside\\n\\nBuildings 60 or 90 at the time of the shooting. But circumstantial\\n\\nevidence alone can be constitutionally sufficient, see, e.g., Weems,\\n\\n318 Ga. at 101 (2) (a)-(b), and the evidence here meets that standard.\\n\\nThat evidence showed that Foster was shot and killed with a .40-\\n\\ncaliber bullet when he was just outside McCorkel’s apartment,\\n\\nwhich was at the end of Building 60 and next to Building 90. A spent\\n\\n.40-caliber shell casing was found near Building 90, and Hooks an-\\n\\nswered the door of his sister’s apartment in that building and said\\n\\nhe had been there all night, except for when he went out for a ciga-\\n\\nrette. The jury viewed photographs and a to-scale diagram showing\\n\\nthe short distance between all the apartments in Building 90, in-\\n\\ncluding Hooks’s sister’s apartment, and the location of Foster and\\n\\nthe spent shell. Before he died, Foster said multiple times that\\n\\n                                  7\\n “Buddha” shot him, and multiple witnesses identified Hooks—who\\n\\nwas at his sister’s apartment a short distance away from where the\\n\\nshooting occurred and next to where the spent shell casing was\\n\\nfound—as the only person they knew who went by the nickname\\n\\n“Buddha.” Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdicts, this\\n\\nevidence authorized the jury to conclude that Hooks was the “Bud-\\n\\ndha” who shot Foster and to find him guilty of the felony murder of\\n\\nFoster predicated on the aggravated assault of shooting him, and for\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of that crime. See Ro-\\n\\ndriquez v. State, 309 Ga. 542, 546 (1) (847 SE2d 303) (2020) (con-\\n\\ncluding that sufficient evidence supported the felony murder convic-\\n\\ntion where circumstantial evidence, including cell phone records\\n\\nplacing the defendant at or near the crime scene, which was within\\n\\nwalking distance of his apartment, and a prior altercation between\\n\\nthe defendant and victim, authorized the jury to find that the de-\\n\\nfendant, and not another person, shot the victim). See also Hill v.\\n\\nState, 276 Ga. 220, 221 (3) (576 SE2d 886) (2003) (“Evidence that\\n\\nthe defendant or an accomplice either carried or was within arm’s\\n\\n                                 8\\n length of a weapon during the commission of a crime authorizes a\\n\\nfinding of guilt of violating OCGA § 16-11-106 (b).”).\\n\\n     (b) When a conviction is based on circumstantial evidence, the\\n\\nState must present sufficient evidence to “exclude every other rea-\\n\\nsonable hypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.” OCGA §\\n\\n24-14-6. But “not every hypothesis is reasonable,” and whether a\\n\\ngiven hypothesis is reasonable is a determination for the jury that\\n\\nwe do not disturb “unless it is insufficient as a matter of law.” See\\n\\nDrennon v. State, 314 Ga. 854, 861-862 (3) (880 SE2d 139) (2022)\\n\\n(cleaned up).\\n\\n      Hooks contends that the evidence against him was entirely cir-\\n\\ncumstantial and that the State did not exclude beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt the possibility that Foster’s identification of “Buddha” as the\\n\\nshooter could have referred to someone other than Hooks. See OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-14-6. Even if we assume that the evidence was entirely circum-\\n\\nstantial,2 Hooks’s nickname, which Foster gave to identify his\\n\\n\\n     2 Generally, an eyewitness’s identification of a defendant is direct evi-\\n\\ndence of guilt. See Bates v. State, 317 Ga. 809, 814 (2) n.3 (896 SE2d 851)\\n\\n                                     9\\n shooter, was not the only evidence linking him to the crime. As we\\n\\njust discussed, Foster was shot with a .40-caliber bullet when he was\\n\\nbetween Building 60 and Building 90, a spent .40-caliber shell cas-\\n\\ning was found next to Building 90, and Hooks—whose nickname is\\n\\n“Buddha”—was at his sister’s apartment in Building 90 on the night\\n\\nof the shooting. In support of his hypothesis that another “Buddha”\\n\\nwas the shooter, Hooks points only to McCorkel’s testimony that she\\n\\nhad “heard of other people in town” going by the nickname “Bud-\\n\\ndha.” But McCorkel, who lived in the same apartment complex as\\n\\nHooks and Foster, clarified that Hooks was the only person she knew\\n\\nwho went by the name “Buddha,” and Officer Brooks, who had been\\n\\nHooks’s neighbor at a different apartment complex, testified that\\n\\nHooks was the only “Buddha” he knew. Also, the lead detective tes-\\n\\ntified that after learning that Foster had identified “Buddha” as the\\n\\n\\n\\n(2023). See also Gittens v. State, 307 Ga. 841, 843 (1) n.2 (838 SE2d 888) (2020).\\n(“Eyewitness testimony based on the witness’s firsthand observations of the\\ncrime is direct, not circumstantial, evidence.”). For purposes of addressing\\nHook’s argument, we assume without deciding that Foster’s identification of\\nhis shooter by the nickname “Buddha” was circumstantial evidence because\\npolice then used that information and additional inferences to identify Hooks\\nas the “Buddha” Foster had referred to.\\n                                       10\\n shooter and that Hooks went by that nickname, he exhausted other\\n\\nleads before arresting Hooks for the murder. These identifications\\n\\nof Hooks as “Buddha,” combined with the close proximity between\\n\\nthe location of the spent shell casing that matched the fatal bullet\\n\\nand the apartment where Hooks was that night, authorized the jury\\n\\nto reject as unreasonable the hypothesis that another “Buddha” with\\n\\nno connection to the crime scene was the shooter. See Drennon, 314\\n\\nGa. at 861-862 (3). Given this evidence, the jury was authorized to\\n\\nreject Hooks’s theory that some other person with the same nick-\\n\\nname shot Foster. See Graves v. State, 306 Ga. 485, 486-487 (1)\\n\\n(2019) (concluding that circumstantial evidence, including video\\n\\nshowing the defendant alone exit a taxi after the taxi crashed and\\n\\non the night the taxi’s driver was shot, was sufficient for the jury to\\n\\nreject his contention that there was another passenger in the same\\n\\ntaxi but not shown in the video who had shot the taxi driver). Cf.\\n\\nMoulder v. State, 317 Ga. 43, 44-47 (1)-(2) (891 SE2d 903) (2023)\\n\\n(even without any physical evidence linking the defendant to the\\n\\ncrime scene or evidence that the defendant went by the nickname\\n\\n                                  11\\n “Youngster,” whom the victim said he was with before he was found\\n\\ndead, other evidence—including that the defendant knew the victim,\\n\\nused to live and had a family member who lived near where the vic-\\n\\ntim’s car was found, and had been in Georgia on the day of the shoot-\\n\\ning—was sufficient to authorize the jury to reject the defendant’s\\n\\nhypothesis that an unidentified person who went by the nickname\\n\\n“Youngster,” and not the defendant, was the shooter).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

JERRY DWAYNE ADAMS v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      In 2003, a jury found Jerry Dwayne Adams guilty of two counts of kidnapping\\nwith bodily injury, hijacking a motor vehicle, and battery. Adams’s convictions were\\naffirmed on appeal. Adams v. State, \\n276 Ga. App. 319\\n (\\n623 SE2d 525\\n) (2005). In\\nMarch 2024, Adams filed a motion to vacate an illegal sentence, arguing that his\\nconvictions for kidnapping with bodily injury and battery should have merged with his\\nconviction for hijacking a motor vehicle. Adams also argued that the trial court should\\nhave held a pre-sentence hearing on the merger issue. The trial court subsequently\\ndenied the motion, and Adams filed this direct appeal.\\n      Under OCGA § 17-10-1 (f), a court may modify a sentence during the year after\\nits imposition or within 120 days after remittitur following a direct appeal, whichever\\nis later. Frazier v. State, \\n302 Ga. App. 346\\n, 348 (\\n691 SE2d 247\\n) (2010). Once, as here,\\nthis statutory period expires, a trial court may modify only a void sentence. \\nId.\\n A\\nsentence is void if the court imposes punishment that the law does not allow. Jones v.\\nState, \\n278 Ga. 669\\n, 670 (\\n604 SE2d 483\\n) (2004). When a sentence falls within the\\nstatutory range of punishment, it is not void and is not subject to modification beyond\\nthe time provided in § 17-10-1 (f). See id. Moreover, a direct appeal does not lie from\\nthe denial of a motion to modify a sentence filed outside the statutory time period\\nunless the motion raises a colorable claim that the sentence is, in fact, void. Frazier,\\n302 Ga. App. at 348\\n; Harper v. State, \\n286 Ga. 216\\n, 217, n. 1 (\\n686 SE2d 786\\n) (2009).\\n      Adams has not raised a colorable claim that his sentences are void because his\\narguments have no bearing on whether the sentences fall within the statutory ranges\\n of permissible punishments for the crimes of which he was convicted. See von Thomas\\nv. State, \\n293 Ga. 569\\n, 572 (2) (\\n748 SE2d 446\\n) (2013) (“Motions to vacate a void\\nsentence generally are limited to claims that – even assuming the existence and validity\\nof the conviction for which the sentence was imposed – the law does not authorize\\nthat sentence, most typically because it exceeds the most severe punishment for which\\nthe applicable penal statute provides.”). Rather, Adams raises a merger argument.\\nThis merger claim, however, is a challenge to his convictions, not his sentence, and\\nthus does not state a valid void-sentence claim. See Williams v. State, \\n287 Ga. 192\\n,\\n193-194 (\\n695 SE2d 244\\n) (2010) (merger argument constitutes a challenge to\\nconviction). Similarly, Adams’s claim that the trial court erred in failing to hold a pre-\\nsentence hearing does not call into question the validity of his sentence and therefore\\ndoes not state a valid void-sentence claim. Claims taking issue with the procedure\\nemployed in imposing a valid sentence or questioning the fairness of an imposed\\nsentence do not allege a sentence is void. Mosley v. State, \\n301 Ga. App. 47\\n, 49 (\\n686\\nSE2d 833\\n) (2009).\\n      Accordingly, because Adams has not raised a colorable void-sentence claim, this\\nappeal is hereby DISMISSED.\\n\\n                                         Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\n                                           Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\\n                                                                       05/22/2024\\n                                                    I certify that the above is a true extract from\\n                                         the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\n                                                    Witness my signature and the seal of said court\\n                                         hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                           , Clerk.\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9506267/jerry-dwayne-adams-v-state/'}),\n",

COBB COUNTY v. FLOAM et al.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n       “Courts are not vehicles for engaging in merely academic\\n\\ndebates or deciding purely theoretical questions. We ‘say what the\\n\\nlaw is’ only as needed to resolve an actual controversy.” Sons of\\n\\nConfederate Veterans v. Henry County Bd. of Commissioners, \\n315\\n\\nGa. 39\\n, 39 (\\n880 SE2d 168\\n) (2022) (“SCV”). This case presents an\\n\\nactual controversy; the Cobb County Commission has asserted an\\n\\nunprecedented power to change acts of the General Assembly, and\\n\\nmembers of the Cobb community have made serious arguments that\\n\\nthe County’s action was unconstitutional. But we are not empowered\\n\\nto decide those arguments merely because an actual controversy\\n\\nexists; the plaintiffs before us must also seek relief of the right kind.\\n\\nAnd the relief sought here is not relief that the plaintiffs can receive\\n even if they are right about the unconstitutionality of the County’s\\n\\naction. Accordingly, their claim must be dismissed.\\n\\n       David and Catherine Floam sought a declaratory judgment\\n\\nthat    the   Cobb   County        Board     of    Commissioners   acted\\n\\nunconstitutionally   when     it    passed        an   amendment   (“BOC\\n\\nAmendment”) changing commission district boundaries that had\\n\\nbeen enacted by the General Assembly in 2022. The trial court ruled\\n\\nfor the Floams, concluding that the BOC Amendment exceeded the\\n\\nCounty’s Home Rule powers under Article IX, Section II, Paragraph\\n\\nI of the Georgia Constitution (the “Home Rule Paragraph”). Cobb\\n\\nCounty appeals, arguing three grounds for reversal: (1) the Floams\\n\\nlacked constitutional standing because they did not allege an\\n\\nindividualized injury; (2) the Floams could not pursue declaratory\\n\\nrelief because they did not show they faced uncertainty as to their\\n\\nfuture conduct; and (3) the trial court erred on the merits in\\n\\nconcluding that the BOC Amendment was barred by provisions of\\n\\nthe Home Rule Paragraph. We conclude that although the Floams\\n\\nhad constitutional standing, they did not show any uncertainty as\\n\\n                                     2\\n to their future conduct that warranted declaratory relief. Therefore,\\n\\nthe trial court erred in granting such relief, and we reverse. We do\\n\\nnot reach the merits of the constitutional arguments.\\n\\n      The record shows the following. 1 In early 2022, the General\\n\\nAssembly passed, and the Governor signed, Act 562, which revised\\n\\ndistrict boundaries for Cobb County commission districts. Act 562\\n\\nwas supported by less than a majority of the County’s legislative\\n\\ndelegation and departed from the usual “local courtesy” tradition in\\n\\nwhich a majority of a county’s legislative delegation determines\\n\\nwhich local redistricting maps are enacted through local legislation.\\n\\nUnhappy with this, the Cobb County Board of Commissioners\\n\\n(“BOC”) in October 2022 passed the BOC Amendment to amend Act\\n\\n562 and create new maps identical to those unsuccessfully proposed\\n\\nby the majority legislative delegation. The BOC Amendment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 Although this case comes before us on a grant of summary judgment to\\n\\nthe Floams, the parties do not dispute the relevant facts. Compare Cowart v.\\nWidener, \\n287 Ga. 622\\n, 623 (1) (a) (\\n697 SE2d 779\\n) (2010) (“In our de novo review\\nof the grant of a motion for summary judgment, we must view the evidence,\\nand all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to\\nthe nonmovant.” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n                                      3\\n provided that it was effective January 1, 2023, so the November\\n\\n2022 elections were conducted using the General Assembly’s maps.\\n\\n     In the summer of 2023, David and Catherine Floam joined an\\n\\nexisting lawsuit seeking declaratory relief against Cobb County.2\\n\\nThey sought a declaratory judgment that the BOC Amendment was\\n\\nunconstitutional under the Home Rule Paragraph and that Act 562\\n\\nas passed by the General Assembly is legal and binding; they also\\n\\nsought an order declaring that, until the validity of the BOC\\n\\nAmendment was determined, the County must not hold any\\n\\nelections using the County Map and that the County should compel\\n\\nthe Board of Elections to act accordingly. In their complaint, the\\n\\nFloams alleged that the General Assembly’s map placed them in\\n\\nDistrict 1, they voted in that district in the November 2022 general\\n\\nelections, and the BOC Amendment placed them in District 3. The\\n\\nFloams argued that the BOC Amendment affected them in the\\n\\nfollowing ways: their commissioner is different from the one they\\n\\n\\n     2 The lawsuit was initially filed by Cobb County Commissioner Keli\\nGambrill, the trial court dismissed her claims for lack of standing, and she\\nultimately did not appeal that dismissal.\\n                                     4\\n voted for; their legal districts are unknown to them; they have voted\\n\\nand intended to vote in future elections; they have an interest in\\n\\nvoting in a legal district; and they have an interest in having the\\n\\nlaws of this State properly executed and the public duty in question\\n\\nenforced. The Floams alleged that the County had a public duty to\\n\\nfollow the rule of law and to enforce and implement a legal district\\n\\nmap so the Cobb County Board of Elections could conduct a lawful\\n\\nelection, and that voters had a public right to “free and fair elections”\\n\\nand a public right to vote in an election based on “lawfully created\\n\\nand lawfully implemented district maps.”\\n\\n     The County filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, among other\\n\\nthings, that the Floams lacked standing. The trial court denied the\\n\\nmotion, concluding that the Floams had standing because they\\n\\nalleged an individualized injury flowing from the constitutionality\\n\\nof the BOC Amendment. The trial court concluded that because the\\n\\nBOC Amendment changed the Floams’ district after they voted in\\n\\nanother one, “if the [BOC Amendment] is determined to be\\n\\nunconstitutional, . . . then the Floams have identified a harm that is\\n\\n                                   5\\n concrete, actual and particular to them.” The court also concluded\\n\\nthat the lawsuit was consistent with the purpose of a declaratory\\n\\njudgment, because “the Floams’ suit seeks relief from the\\n\\nuncertainty and insecurity of their voting rights and voter status in\\n\\nlight of the disputed districts.”\\n\\n     The trial court later granted the Floams’ motion for summary\\n\\njudgment and denied the County’s cross-motion for summary\\n\\njudgment. At issue in this appeal, the parties disputed whether the\\n\\nBOC Amendment was within the County’s authority under the\\n\\nHome Rule Paragraph.\\n\\n     The trial court concluded that Cobb County’s BOC Amendment\\n\\nwas barred by two exceptions to the Home Rule Paragraph and was,\\n\\ntherefore, an unconstitutional exercise of authority under the\\n\\nCounty’s constitutional Home Rule powers.\\n\\n     The County appealed. In response, the Floams filed motions to\\n\\nexpedite the appeal and to lift the supersedeas stay imposed by\\n\\nOCGA § 5-6-46 (a). The County opposed both motions. We granted\\n\\nthe Floams’ motion to expedite the appeal but held in abeyance their\\n\\n                                    6\\n motion to lift the stay. We held oral arguments on April 17, 2024.\\n\\n     1. On appeal, the County argues that the Floams do not have\\n\\nconstitutional standing to challenge the constitutionality of the BOC\\n\\nAmendment      because    they   were    required   to   establish   an\\n\\nindividualized injury. The County argues that their claims are based\\n\\nonly on generalized grievances and not on particularized harms. We\\n\\ndisagree; to challenge county legislative action, the Floams needed\\n\\nonly to establish standing as community stakeholders interested in\\n\\ntheir local government following the law, and they have done that.\\n\\n     Standing is a jurisdictional prerequisite necessary to invoke a\\n\\ncourt’s judicial power under the Georgia Constitution. See Ga.\\n\\nConst. of 1983, Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. I. (“Judicial Power Paragraph”);\\n\\nSCV, 315 Ga. at 44-45 (2) (a). As we recently explained in SCV, it\\n\\nhas long been the law that “[w]here a public duty is at stake, a\\n\\nplaintiff’s membership in the community provides the necessary\\n\\nstanding to bring a cause of action to ensure a local government\\n\\nfollows the law.” Id. at 61 (2) (c) (iii). We arrived at that conclusion\\n\\nbased on precedent showing that for nearly 100 years prior to the\\n\\n                                   7\\n adoption of the 1983 Georgia Constitution, Georgia had allowed\\n\\ncitizen, taxpayer, resident, or voter suits to challenge various county\\n\\nand city actions without demonstrating a particularized injury\\n\\nbecause those community stakeholders had a cognizable interest in\\n\\nhaving their government follow the law. See id. at 53-61 (2) (c)\\n\\n(collecting cases).\\n\\n     The County argues that this standing rule does not apply\\n\\nbecause the Floams are challenging the constitutionality of the BOC\\n\\nAmendment. In support, the County relies on long-standing\\n\\nprecedent that, in order to challenge the constitutionality of state\\n\\nstatutes, the Georgia Constitution requires a more particularized\\n\\ninjury similar to the federal Article III injury-in-fact requirement.\\n\\nSee SCV, 315 Ga. at 54 (2) (c) n.13 (citing cases). This Court early\\n\\non recognized that our judicial review was sometimes precluded in\\n\\na way that is akin to the Article III injury-in-fact requirement. We\\n\\nfirst held in 1884 that\\n\\n     [c]omity to a co-ordinate department of the government\\n     requires, according to many decisions of this and other\\n     courts, that causes shall not be disposed of upon\\n\\n                                  8\\n      constitutional grounds when it is possible to avoid such\\n     questions, without a sacrifice of the rights of parties[.]\\n\\nBd. of Ed. of Glynn County v. Mayor of Brunswick, \\n72 Ga. 353\\n, 354-\\n\\n355 (1) (1884) (involving challenge to state legislation that created\\n\\nboard of education and changed funding procedure). Two years later,\\n\\nwe again emphasized that separation of powers precluded our\\n\\nreview of a challenge to a state statute regarding a liquor law,\\n\\nconcluding that it is only when “the law operates upon the private\\n\\nproperty of an individual, and that is seized or destroyed or\\n\\nconfiscated, or the individual is arrested and indicted thereunder for\\n\\nits violation” can the “portion of the law thus affecting his private\\n\\nproperty and personal liberty . . . be assailed by him as\\n\\nunconstitutional or illegal[.]” Scoville v. Calhoun, \\n76 Ga. 263\\n, 269\\n\\n(1886). It soon became well settled that a court “will not listen to an\\n\\nobjection made to the constitutionality of an act by a party whose\\n\\nrights it does not affect, and who has, therefore, no interest in\\n\\ndefeating it.” Reid v. Mayor, Etc. of Eatonton, \\n80 Ga. 755\\n, 757 (\\n6 SE\\n\\n602\\n) (1888). These cases show the particularized injury requirement\\n\\n\\n                                  9\\n for challenges to state statutes has long been rooted in principles of\\n\\nseparation of powers. See Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Par. III\\n\\n(“The legislative, judicial, and executive powers shall forever remain\\n\\nseparate and distinct; and no person discharging the duties of one\\n\\nshall at the same time exercise the functions of either of the others\\n\\nexcept as herein provided.”).\\n\\n     But a county commission is not a part of State government,\\n\\nmuch less a branch co-equal with the State’s judicial branch. For\\n\\nthat matter, the constitutional separation of powers principle does\\n\\nnot even apply to counties or municipalities. See Bldg. Auth. of\\n\\nFulton County v. State of Ga., \\n253 Ga. 242\\n, 247 (5) (\\n321 SE2d 97\\n)\\n\\n(1984) (adhering to cases decided prior to adoption of 1983\\n\\nConstitution that held “that the constitutional provision applies only\\n\\nto the state” and concluding that just as the Separation of Powers\\n\\nProvision did not apply to municipalities, it also did not apply to\\n\\ncounty governments because “a county commission is both the\\n\\nexecutive and legislative branch”). Consequently, the animating\\n\\nreason to require a particularized injury to challenge state\\n\\n                                  10\\n legislative actions is not present for challenges to county or\\n\\nmunicipality legislative actions.\\n\\n      Cobb County correctly argues that there is recent case law\\n\\nfrom this Court seemingly imposing a particularized injury\\n\\nrequirement for challenges to county ordinances. But a closer review\\n\\nof those cases shows that they are analytically unsound and cannot\\n\\nbe squared with SCV. Even so, in only one case did our holding align\\n\\nwith the County’s argument, and we overrule that case today.\\n\\n     First, some of those cases uncritically imported without\\n\\nanalysis the particularized injury required to challenge state\\n\\nactions. See, e.g., Manlove v. Unified Govt. of Athens-Clarke County,\\n\\n285 Ga. 637\\n, 638 (\\n680 SE2d 405\\n) (2009) (in evaluating challenge to\\n\\ncounty noise ordinance, citing Feminist Women’s Health Ctr. v.\\n\\nBurgess, \\n282 Ga. 433\\n (\\n651 SE2d 36\\n) (2007), which involved a\\n\\nconstitutional challenge to state regulations governing Georgia’s\\n\\nMedicaid program). But, as discussed above, the reason for requiring\\n\\na particularized injury for state actions does not carry over to local\\n\\ngovernments.\\n\\n                                    11\\n       Other cases imposing the particularized injury requirement to\\n\\ncounty ordinances did so on the basis of federal standing\\n\\njurisprudence. See, e.g., Polo Golf & Country Club Homeowners\\n\\nAssn. v. Cunard, \\n306 Ga. 788\\n, 791 (1) (b) (\\n833 SE2d 505\\n) (2019)\\n\\n(citing case law that cited United Supreme Court precedent and\\n\\nholding that the plaintiffs had standing to pursue declaratory relief\\n\\nagainst enforcement of county’s stormwater ordinance where the\\n\\n“threat of an injury in fact” was “actual and imminent, not\\n\\nconjectural or hypothetical”);3 Granite State Outdoor Advert., Inc. v.\\n\\nCity of Roswell, \\n283 Ga. 417\\n, 418 (1) (\\n658 SE2d 587\\n) (2008) (applying\\n\\nfederal standing jurisprudence to challenge of city sign ordinance);4\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 Polo Golf cited Women’s Surgical Center v. Berry, \\n302 Ga. 349\\n (\\n806\\n\\nSE2d 606\\n) (2017), which in addition to directly citing United States Supreme\\nCourt precedent on standing, also contained a “see also” citation to\\nGeorgiaCarry.Org v. Atlanta Botanical Garden, \\n299 Ga. 26\\n (\\n785 SE2d 874\\n)\\n(2016), but that case addressed whether a plaintiff could pursue declaratory\\nrelief (i.e., had statutory standing), not whether a plaintiff had standing under\\nthe Georgia Constitution. See GeorgiaCarry.Org, \\n299 Ga. at 28-31\\n (1).\\n       4 Granite State cited Bo Fancy Productions v. Rabun County Bd. Of\\n\\nCommrs., \\n267 Ga. 341\\n, 344-345 (\\n478 SE2d 373\\n) (1996), as showing that\\n“Georgia jurisprudence” was consistent with the federal case law cited in\\nGranite State. See Granite State, 283 Ga. at 420 (1). It is unsurprising that Bo\\nFancy was consistent with federal case law because (1) it involved an\\nappellant’s attempt to block a county’s enforcement of a state statute, which\\n\\n                                       12\\n see also Grady v. Unified Govt. of Athens-Clarke County, \\n289 Ga.\\n\\n726\\n, 727 (1) n.1 (\\n715 SE2d 148\\n) (2011) (relying on Granite State and\\n\\ncase law that relied on Granite State to conclude that appellant had\\n\\n“unquestioned standing to lodge a facial challenge to the provision\\n\\nof the [county] ordinance under which he was convicted, as he clearly\\n\\nsuffered an ‘injury in fact’ when he was penalized”). None of these\\n\\ncases considered standing under the Georgia Constitution, and they\\n\\nwere wrong to rely on federal standing jurisprudence to consider\\n\\nchallenges to county ordinances, because “federal standing doctrine\\n\\ndoes not control” the nature of the state judicial power. See SCV, 315\\n\\nGa. at 46 (2) (a).\\n\\n      Moreover, these cases all post-date the adoption of the 1983\\n\\nConstitution. As described above and discussed more fully in SCV,\\n\\n\\nrequires a particularized injury, and (2) it was a challenge based on First\\nAmendment grounds. Bo Fancy, \\n267 Ga. at 344-345\\n (2) (a). Neither Bo Fancy,\\nnor the case cited therein (Stewart v. Davidson, \\n218 Ga. 760\\n, 764 (1) (\\n130 SE2d\\n822\\n) (1963)), is relevant here because neither involved constitutional\\nchallenges to county legislation. See Bo Fancy, \\n267 Ga. at 344-345\\n (2) (a).\\n      Moreover, Granite State was the only one of these cases to conclude that\\nstanding was lacking; the others all either failed to address standing or found\\nstanding was present, and so have little precedential force on this point. And\\nthere was no indication in Granite State that the plaintiff would have cleared\\nSCV’s community stakeholder standing threshold, either.\\n                                      13\\n the Judicial Power Paragraph had a fixed meaning based on\\n\\nconsistent and definitive precedent that allowed community\\n\\nstakeholders to sue to challenge county action. The cases post-dating\\n\\nthe 1983 Constitution cannot change the meaning of the Judicial\\n\\nPower Paragraph. See Olevik v. State, \\n302 Ga. 228\\n, 235 (2) (c) (i) (\\n806\\n\\nSE2d 505\\n) (2017) (“[T]here are few principles of Georgia law more\\n\\nvenerable than the fundamental principle that a constitutional\\n\\nprovision means today what it meant at the time that it was\\n\\nenacted.”).5\\n\\n\\n      5 Because Granite State is the only case that held that the plaintiffs\\n\\nlacked a particularized injury to challenge a county ordinance, it is the only\\ncase we need consider whether to overrule. Under the doctrine of stare decisis,\\nwe consider whether to retain incorrect precedent by balancing “the\\nimportance of having the question decided against the importance of having it\\ndecided right.” State v. Burns, \\n306 Ga. 117\\n, 123 (2) (\\n829 SE2d 367\\n) (2019)\\n(citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis in original). In making this\\ndetermination, we often consider, among other things, “the age of precedent,\\nthe reliance interests at stake, the workability of the decision, and, most\\nimportantly, the soundness of its reasoning.” Olevik, \\n302 Ga. at 244-245\\n (2) (c)\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). Also relevant is the extent to which the\\ndecision was the result of actual legal reasoning. See Johnson v. State, \\n315 Ga.\\n876\\n, 887-888 (\\n885 SE2d 725\\n) (2023) (stare decisis did not require retaining a\\ndecision that was “unreasoned (bordering on accidental)” and “in conflict with\\nour own decisions”); Ammons v. State, \\n315 Ga. 149\\n, 171-172 (1) (\\n880 SE2d 544\\n)\\n(2022) (Pinson, J., concurring) (“If the past decision in question is unreasoned,\\nor if it disregards the basic legal principles that courts use to do law, the\\nargument for overruling is easier to make.”).\\n\\n                                       14\\n       Here, the Floams’ standing is firmly established. Because the\\n\\nFloams are residents of Cobb County, they are community\\n\\nstakeholders in that government. As we made clear in SCV,\\n\\ncommunity stakeholders have standing to enforce a public duty.\\n\\nSCV, 315 Ga. at 60 (2) (c) (iii). The entire dispute in this case is about\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       We have already explained that Granite State did not offer any reasoning\\nfor importing the particularized injury requirement applicable to challenges to\\nstatutes. And we have typically applied stare decisis with less force to\\nconstitutional decisions, meaning that there is “less room . . . for the other\\nfactors to preserve [incorrect precedent].” Olevik, 302 Ga. at 245 (2) (c) (iv).\\nNone of the remaining factors support retaining Granite State’s rule. It was\\ndecided 16 years ago, and we have overruled decisions much older than that.\\nSee, e.g., Southall v. State, \\n300 Ga. 462\\n, 468 (1) (\\n796 SE2d 261\\n) (2017)\\n(overruling 45-year-old precedent); State v. Hudson, \\n293 Ga. 656\\n, 661-662 (\\n748\\nSE2d 910\\n) (2013) (overruling 38-year-old precedent). There are no reliance\\ninterests at stake, and Granite State has not become “deeply entrenched in our\\njurisprudence.” See, e.g., Frett v. State Farm Employee Workers’ Compensation,\\n309 Ga. 44\\n, 60 (3) (c) (\\n844 SE2d 749\\n) (2020) (in considering age of precedent\\nand reliance interests, noting that the precedent at issue had not “become\\ndeeply entrenched in our jurisprudence”); Savage v. State, \\n297 Ga. 627\\n, 641 (5)\\n(b) (\\n774 SE2d 624\\n) (2015) (substantial reliance interests are most common in\\ncontract and property cases where parties may have acted in conformance with\\nexisting legal rules in order to conduct transactions). Finally, the rule\\narticulated in SCV is much more workable than the particularized-injury rule\\nsimilar to the injury-in-fact rule that is part of federal standing jurisprudence.\\nSee, e.g., Sierra v. City of Hallandale Beach, 996 F3d 1110, 1115-1117 (11th\\nCir. 2021) (Newsom, J., concurring) (noting difficulty and inconsistency in\\napplying the injury-in-fact requirement). Because none of the stare decisis\\nfactors weigh in favor of retaining Granite State, we overrule it. And we\\nlikewise disapprove any other cases to the extent that they could be read to\\nimpose a particularized injury requirement to challenge the constitutionality\\nof county actions, legislative or otherwise.\\n                                       15\\n that public duty. In enacting Act 562, the General Assembly set the\\n\\nelectoral district lines for Cobb County. Although the parties dispute\\n\\nwhether Cobb County had the authority to revise those district lines,\\n\\nit could only do so if the Home Rule Paragraph allowed. Whether\\n\\nthis case is framed as a duty to follow Act 562 or a requirement to\\n\\nfollow the Home Rule Paragraph, in either case, the heart of the case\\n\\nconcerns Cobb County’s duty to follow the law. This is sufficient to\\n\\nconfer standing for the Floams’ challenge to the BOC Amendment.\\n\\nSee SCV, 315 Ga. at 61 (2) (c) (iii) (“Where a public duty is at stake,\\n\\na plaintiff’s membership in the community provides the necessary\\n\\nstanding to bring a cause of action to ensure a local government\\n\\nfollows the law.”); see also Williams v. DeKalb County, \\n308 Ga. 265\\n,\\n\\n272 (3) (b) (i) (\\n840 SE2d 423\\n) (2020) (“Williams, as a citizen of\\n\\nDeKalb County, generally has standing pursuant to OCGA § 9-6-24\\n\\nto bring a claim seeking to require a public official to perform the\\n\\npublic duties that the General Assembly has conferred upon that\\n\\nofficial.”); League of Women Voters of Atlanta-Fulton County v. City\\n\\nof Atlanta, \\n245 Ga. 301\\n, 303-304 (1) (\\n264 SE2d 859\\n) (1980) (“We hold\\n\\n                                  16\\n that the plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit. In this state, it is\\n\\nestablished that a citizen and taxpayer of a municipality, without\\n\\nthe necessity for showing any special injury, has standing” to\\n\\nchallenge city council committee appointments as ultra vires actions\\n\\nby municipal officer).6\\n\\n      2. The County next argues that even if the Floams have\\n\\nconstitutional standing, they cannot obtain a declaratory judgment\\n\\nbecause they do not face the requisite uncertainty about future\\n\\ndecisions they may face. We agree.\\n\\n      Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the courts of this State\\n\\nare authorized “to declare rights and other legal relations of any\\n\\ninterested party petitioning for such declaration” “[i]n cases of\\n\\n\\n      6  The County also argues that the Floams could not assert taxpayer\\nstanding because redistricting legislation does “not create an illegal debt, cause\\nillegal expenses to be incurred, result in increased taxes, or misappropriate\\nfunds.” The County cites SCV for this proposition, but SCV did not hold that a\\nplaintiff’s interest in having their local government follow the law was\\ndependent on illegal expenditures; indeed it recognized that one’s membership\\nin the community sometimes is sufficient to confer standing to sue a local\\ngovernment “even in cases where no tax dollars [are] directly implicated.” SCV,\\n315 Ga. at 59 (2) (c) (ii). In any case, the County’s argument ignores the fact\\nthat there are expenses incurred by preparing for and conducting elections,\\nwhich are predicated upon electoral district lines; if the redistricting is illegal,\\ntaxpayers face a substantial risk of injury as a result.\\n                                        17\\n actual controversy” and “in any civil case in which . . . the ends of\\n\\njustice [so] require[.]” OCGA § 9-4-2 (a), (b). Although the Act is to\\n\\nbe “liberally construed and administered[,]” the text of the Act also\\n\\nplainly states that its purpose “is to settle and afford relief from\\n\\nuncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other\\n\\nlegal relations[.]” OCGA § 9-4-1. This language has been part of the\\n\\nAct since it was first enacted in 1945. See Ga. L. 1945, pp. 137, 139,\\n\\n§ 13. In one of the first cases interpreting the Act, this Court made\\n\\nthe following observation:\\n\\n     Doubtless [the Act] was designed to afford security and\\n     relief against uncertainty and to guide parties to a\\n     contract or occupying other legal or jural relations as to\\n     their future conduct with a view to avoid litigation, rather\\n     than in aid of it, and to settle and fix rights at a time\\n     before there had been breaches of contracts, violation and\\n     disregard of rights of others, and thus promote peace,\\n     quiet, and justice, with the ultimate end always\\n     constantly in view that one of the chief purposes is to\\n     declare rights rather than to exclude them.\\n\\nShippen v. Folsom, \\n200 Ga. 58\\n, 67 (1) (\\n35 SE2d 915\\n) (1945) (citation\\n\\nomitted). We explained the Act was designed to “give additional\\n\\nprotection to persons who may become involved in an actual\\n\\n\\n                                 18\\n justiciable controversy, in that they differ between themselves as to\\n\\nwhat their rights are, and who wish to find them out before taking\\n\\nsome dangerous step which might or might not be authorized.” \\nId.\\n\\nat 68\\n (1).\\n\\n     Since that initial observation about the Act’s design, this Court\\n\\nhas consistently and repeatedly focused on whether an adjudication\\n\\nof rights was necessary in order to help or protect the petitioner or\\n\\nplaintiff. Early on, we said that a petition for declaratory relief will\\n\\nlie only\\n\\n     when there be some fact or circumstances which\\n     necessitate[s] a determination of disputes, not merely for\\n     the purpose of enforcing accrued rights[,] but in order to\\n     guide and protect the petitioner from uncertainty and\\n     insecurity with respect to the propriety of some future act\\n     or conduct which is properly incident to his alleged rights,\\n     and which future action without such direction might\\n     reasonably jeopardize his interest.\\n\\nAldridge v.

The thrust of the Floams’\\n\\n“uncertainty” is that they do not know in which district they reside,\\n\\nbut this is not the kind of uncertainty required by our case law. A\\n\\nrequest for declaratory relief is a request for “prospective relief—\\n\\nrelief from the threat of wrongful acts and injuries yet to come.”\\n\\nLathrop v. Deal, \\n301 Ga. 408\\n, 434 (III) (C) (\\n801 SE2d 867\\n) (2017).\\n\\nThe Floams allege several past injuries resulting from the BOC\\n\\n                                  24\\n Amendment, but they have not alleged threatened future injury that\\n\\na declaration would prevent them from suffering.\\n\\n     The Floams alleged in their complaint that they should belong\\n\\nin District 1 per the General Assembly’s redistricting, they voted in\\n\\nthat district in November 2022, and as a result of the allegedly\\n\\nillegal BOC Amendment, they are represented by a commissioner\\n\\ndifferent from the one for whom they voted. The Floams also assert\\n\\non appeal that they are uncertain whether their November 2022\\n\\nvotes “functionally counted.”\\n\\n     It is not clear what the Floams mean by the uncertainty as to\\n\\nwhether their votes “functionally counted.” Regardless, their past\\n\\nvotes have no relation to any uncertainty as to their future conduct.\\n\\nThe Floams frame their right as the right to be represented by the\\n\\nperson for whom they voted. But any violation of such a right\\n\\noccurred once the BOC Amendment took effect, and the Floams have\\n\\nnot alleged how that past violation creates uncertainty as to their\\n\\nfuture conduct. They merely argue on appeal that they cannot\\n\\n“confidently participate in their government or rely on their\\n\\n                                 25\\n commissioner to represent their interests because they would not\\n\\nknow who their lawful commissioner is for the next [two] years.” No\\n\\ndoubt, everyone has a right to participate in their government,\\n\\ncontact their representative, and even campaign or support a\\n\\ncandidate, but the Floams do not point to any authority for the\\n\\nproposition that they have a right to do so “confidently.” And nothing\\n\\nabout the BOC Amendment infringes on their right to political\\n\\nparticipation. The Floams may be uncertain about which county\\n\\ncommissioner should represent them, but they do not show any\\n\\nfuture action they risk taking based on this uncertainty.\\n\\n     Their uncertainty regarding whether their 2022 votes\\n\\n“functionally counted” or whether they can participate in their local\\n\\ngovernment affairs “confidently” is simply insufficient to warrant\\n\\ndeclaratory relief. See City of Atlanta v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys.,\\n\\n307 Ga. 877\\n, 880 (\\n838 SE2d 834\\n) (2020) (“[T]he relief sought by a\\n\\nplaintiff must have some immediate legal effect on the parties’\\n\\nconduct, rather than simply burning off an abstract fog of\\n\\nuncertainty.” (emphasis added)).\\n\\n                                   26\\n      With respect to future elections, no declaratory relief lies here\\n\\neither. The Floams may be uncertain as to whether they lawfully\\n\\nreside in District 1 or District 3, but this uncertainty, without more,\\n\\nis insufficient to support a declaration. The Floams must allege that\\n\\nthey are at risk of taking some undirected future action incident to\\n\\ntheir rights and that such action might jeopardize their interests.\\n\\nThey have failed to do so.\\n\\n     The Floams alleged in their complaint that they will vote in\\n\\nfuture elections, including those for the BOC, and there is no\\n\\nallegation that they will not be allowed to vote in such elections. The\\n\\nFloams allege that they might vote in the “wrong” district, but they\\n\\nknow what district they are assigned under the BOC Amendment;\\n\\nthey have no decision to make about where to vote.\\n\\n     By seeking a determination on the validity of the BOC\\n\\nAmendment, the Floams are not asking for guidance with respect to\\n\\nactions they might take or alleging that they risk taking some\\n\\ndangerous step that may or may not be authorized. The Floams’\\n\\nuncertainty, then, does not concern their own future conduct.\\n\\n                                  27\\n Instead, by asking for a declaration that the BOC Amendment was\\n\\nillegal, the Floams are merely attempting to enforce rights that had\\n\\nalready accrued and attempting to direct the future actions of the\\n\\nCounty, which is insufficient to state a claim for declaratory relief.\\n\\nSee Williams, 308 Ga. at 271 (3) (a) (citizen could not pursue\\n\\ndeclaratory relief to challenge legality of county ordinances because\\n\\nhe did not “allege or argue that he face[d] any uncertainty or\\n\\ninsecurity as to his own future conduct”); SJN Props., \\n296 Ga. at 803\\n\\n\\n(2) (b) (iii) (claimant failed to show that it faced any uncertainty or\\n\\ninsecurity as to any of its own future conduct and instead sought an\\n\\nadjudication that would impact the future conduct of the defendant);\\n\\nSapp v.

But BOER is not a party to this\\ncase, and the Floams cannot use a nonparty’s uncertainty to establish their\\nown standing.\\n                                      29\\n which their future conduct depends.

The\\nAttorney General took no position on the Floams’ standing.\\n                                      30\\n       BETHEL, J., concurring.\\n\\n      I agree with the opinion of the Court and join it in full. I write\\n\\nseparately to note my concern about the possible effect of further\\n\\ndelay in reaching the merits of the Cobb County Commission’s effort\\n\\nto redistrict itself, which it seems will inevitably be reached. A\\n\\ndelayed loss by Cobb could give rise to calamitous consequences\\n\\ninflicting serious expense and practical hardship on its citizens.\\n\\nAccordingly, I urge Cobb to act with all dispatch in obtaining a final\\n\\nanswer on the legal merits of its chosen path.\\n\\n      I offer the following illustration not to suggest what will\\n\\nhappen, but only to show what might happen, assuming Cobb’s\\n\\nmerits argument ultimately fails.9 It is clear that Cobb has asserted\\n\\na novel application of the constitutional Home Rule powers that has\\n\\nnever been decided by this Court, though the only Georgia court to\\n\\nreach the merits of Cobb’s argument found it untenable. We\\n\\n\\n      9 While this hypothetical presumes that Cobb’s argument on the merits\\n\\nultimately fails, I do not suggest that will be the likely outcome, and I reiterate\\nthat is not a question we decide here. Given the merits arguments presented\\nthus far, however, it seems fair to observe that Cobb has a substantial risk of\\nlosing and it seems unwise to ignore that risk.\\n                                        31\\n concluded today that the present action is not the proper vehicle by\\n\\nwhich to litigate this issue. But sooner or later, a proper party will\\n\\nalmost certainly bring a proper claim, and a court will decide the\\n\\nnovel issue raised in this case. A review of the record and the current\\n\\nposture of the Cobb County Commission suggests that an adverse\\n\\nmerits decision for Cobb could feasibly result in at least one current\\n\\nCommission member to be found to lack residency in his or her\\n\\ndistrict. And Cobb is currently conducting elections for two seats\\n\\nunder the contested maps. Litigation during and even after those\\n\\nelections seems inevitable. But litigation takes time, and it is easily\\n\\nwithin the realm of possibility that several months could pass before\\n\\nsuch litigation is concluded, particularly if Cobb continues to pursue\\n\\nwhat could be interpreted as a deliberately leisurely litigation\\n\\nstrategy.\\n\\n     Indeed, depending on the timeline of any future litigation, it\\n\\nwould not be inconceivable for Cobb to find itself with three vacant\\n\\nCommission seats and the Commission unable to form a quorum,\\n\\nleaving its citizens without duly elected representation. To avoid\\n\\n                                  32\\n these possibilities, it seems to me that Cobb has an interest in\\n\\nreaching a merits-based resolution as quickly as possible. I urge\\n\\nCobb to act with all due haste in securing finality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  33\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9500812/cobb-county-v-floam/'}),\n",

MADERA v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       BETHEL, Justice.\\n\\n       Francisco Javier Madera was convicted of the malice murder of\\n\\nJuan Carlos Zambrano. 1 On appeal, Madera raises five claims of\\n\\nerror: (1) the trial court erred by denying his motion for new trial on\\n\\nthe general grounds; (2) the trial court erred by admitting video\\n\\nfootage of the injured Zambrano; (3) the trial court erred by\\n\\nadmitting evidence pursuant to OCGA § 24-8-803 (5); (4) trial\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 The crimes occurred on October 13, 2017. In January 2018, a Cobb\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Madera for malice murder, felony murder, and\\naggravated assault. Following a September 2019 jury trial, Madera was found\\nguilty of all counts. The trial court sentenced Madera to serve life in prison for\\nmalice murder; the felony murder count was vacated by operation of law, and\\nthe aggravated assault count merged for sentencing. Madera filed a timely\\nmotion for new trial, which he amended through new counsel. Following a\\nhearing, the trial court denied the motion, as amended, on August 2, 2023.\\nMadera thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal, and the case was docketed to\\nthis Court’s term commencing in December 2023 and submitted for a decision\\non the briefs.\\n counsel was ineffective in two respects; and (5) the cumulative effect\\n\\nof the trial court’s errors and counsel’s deficient performance\\n\\nrequires a new trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\\n\\n     1. Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdicts, the\\n\\nevidence presented at trial showed as follows. On the night of\\n\\nOctober 13, 2017, Madera, Zambrano, and others attended a party\\n\\nat the Cobb County home of Elma Escobar. While Madera and\\n\\nZambrano were dancing with the same woman, the two began\\n\\narguing, and, later in the evening, they physically fought each other.\\n\\nSeveral partygoers separated Madera and Zambrano, and Escobar\\n\\nasked Madera to leave.\\n\\n     Escobar walked Madera to his vehicle, and Madera began to\\n\\nleave. As Escobar was walking back to the house, however, she\\n\\nheard Madera “unlocking” his firearm and saw that he had stopped\\n\\nhis vehicle in the road and had exited the vehicle. Though Escobar\\n\\ngrabbed Madera and tried to calm him, he pointed his gun at\\n\\nZambrano and fired. Witnesses testified that, immediately before\\n\\nthe shooting, Zambrano was hugging another partygoer, and three\\n\\n                                  2\\n witnesses testified that Zambrano did not have anything in his\\n\\nhands when he was shot and did not have a gun in his possession\\n\\nthat night. Escobar heard one gunshot followed by two more and\\n\\nthen saw Zambrano clutching his abdomen. Zambrano fell to the\\n\\nground after being shot. Edwin Santos Saez, another partygoer,\\n\\ntestified that, after Zambrano fell to the ground, Madera shot him\\n\\nagain. Another partygoer heard Madera direct two slurs at\\n\\nZambrano during the shooting. After shooting Zambrano, Madera\\n\\nfled and was arrested two days later at a hotel in Little Rock,\\n\\nArkansas.\\n\\n     Escobar called an ambulance and the police, but Zambrano\\n\\nasked to be driven to the hospital. Zambrano was placed in Saez’s\\n\\nvehicle, and en route to the hospital, Saez crossed paths with and\\n\\nflagged down officers responding to Escobar’s earlier call. Officers\\n\\nfound the unconscious Zambrano in the front passenger seat; he had\\n\\ngunshot wounds to the left side of his abdomen and the upper area\\n\\nof his back. The officers applied pressure to Zambrano’s wounds\\n\\nwhile waiting for emergency medical services to arrive, and their\\n\\n                                 3\\n actions were captured by their body cameras. Zambrano was\\n\\ntransported to the hospital, where he died as a result of his wounds\\n\\nthe following day.\\n\\n     At trial, Madera testified that he acted in self-defense after\\n\\nseeing a snub-nosed revolver in Zambrano’s right hand. The State,\\n\\nhowever, presented evidence showing that no weapons were found\\n\\non Zambrano’s person or during a search of Saez’s vehicle and that\\n\\nno guns or ammunition were found during a search of Escobar’s\\n\\nhome the day after the shooting.\\n\\n     On appeal, Madera first argues that the trial court should have\\n\\ngranted him a new trial on the “general grounds” because, he says,\\n\\nsome of the evidence against him was conflicting. See OCGA §§ 5-5-\\n\\n20 (authorizing grant of new trial if the trial judge concludes that\\n\\nthe jury’s verdict is “contrary to evidence and the principles of\\n\\nequity and justice”) and 5-5-21 (authorizing grant of new trial if the\\n\\ntrial judge concludes that the jury’s verdict is “decidedly and\\n\\nstrongly against the weight of the evidence”). The general grounds\\n\\nrequire a trial court “to exercise a broad discretion to sit as a\\n\\n                                   4\\n ‘thirteenth juror’” and “consider some of the things that he cannot\\n\\nwhen assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, including any\\n\\nconflicts in the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and the weight\\n\\nof the evidence.” Hinton v. State, \\n312 Ga. 258\\n, 262 (1) (c) (\\n862 SE2d\\n\\n320\\n) (2021). “We review whether the trial court exercised its\\n\\ndiscretion as the thirteenth juror, but the decision to grant a new\\n\\ntrial on the general grounds is vested solely in the trial court and is\\n\\nnot subject to our review.” Weems v. State, \\n318 Ga. 98\\n, 102-103 (3)\\n\\n(___ SE2d ____) (2024). Here, in its order denying Madera’s motion\\n\\nfor new trial, the trial court, after stating that it independently\\n\\nreviewed the evidence and considered the credibility of witnesses,\\n\\nexpressly rejected Madera’s general grounds claim. Thus, the trial\\n\\ncourt’s order shows that the court properly exercised its discretion\\n\\nunder OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, and Madera’s argument “is\\n\\notherwise not subject to review by this Court.”2 See Weems, \\n318 Ga.\\n\\n\\n2\\n Madera does not separately argue that the evidence was insufficient to\\n\\nsupport his conviction as a matter of constitutional due process under Jackson\\nv. Virginia, \\n443 U. S. 307\\n (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). In previous\\nappeals in which an appellant raised a general-grounds claim, we have often\\n\\n                                      5\\n at 103 (3).\\n\\n      2. Madera next challenges the admission of a video and audio\\n\\nrecording from a police officer’s body camera which showed\\n\\nemergency responders rendering aid to the wounded Zambrano in\\n\\nSaez’s vehicle. Specifically, Madera asserts for the first time on\\n\\nappeal that the admission of an “excessive number of photographic\\n\\nexhibits” at trial, including autopsy photographs, rendered the body\\n\\ncamera footage cumulative and, thus, “unfairly prejudicial.”\\n\\nBecause Madera did not object on this basis at trial, we review this\\n\\nclaim only for plain error.3 See Gates v. State, \\n298 Ga. 324\\n, 327 (3)\\n\\n\\nreviewed the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of constitutional due\\nprocess, though many of us have questioned the soundness of that approach.\\nSee King v. State, \\n316 Ga. 611\\n, 616 (2) n.8 (\\n889 SE2d 851\\n) (2023). Like in King,\\nhowever, we need not determine the propriety of that approach in this case\\nbecause the evidence against Madera was constitutionally sufficient to affirm\\nhis conviction.\\n      3 In a pretrial motion in limine, Madera sought to have the footage\\n\\nexcluded on the basis that it had “no relevance to any matter in dispute.”\\nNoting that the footage showed Zambrano “injured, lying down in a car, and\\nmoaning and writhing in pain,” Madera argued that the footage would “no\\ndoubt be shocking to a jury” and that, as a result, “its prejudicial effect\\nsubstantially outweighs any probative value that it may have.” But the motion\\nin limine did not expressly challenge the footage as cumulative and Madera\\ndid not lodge a separate contemporaneous objection on the related basis he now\\nargues on appeal, so our review is limited to plain error. See Washington v.\\nState, \\n312 Ga. 495\\n, 500 (2) (b) n.8 (\\n863 SE2d 109\\n) (2021); Williams v. Harvey,\\n\\n                                       6\\n (\\n781 SE2d 772\\n) (2016); OCGA § 24-1-103 (a), (d). To establish plain\\n\\nerror, Madera bears the burden of demonstrating that the alleged\\n\\nerror “was not affirmatively waived”; that it was “clear and not open\\n\\nto reasonable dispute”; that it “affected his substantial rights”; and\\n\\nthat it “seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\\n\\nof judicial proceedings.” Jones v. State, \\n317 Ga. 466\\n, 473 (2) (\\n893\\n\\nSE2d 741\\n) (2023) (citations and punctuation omitted). And where an\\n\\nappellant fails to establish one element of the plain error test, we\\n\\nneed not consider the others. See \\nid.\\n\\n\\n      Madera argues only that the footage at issue should have been\\n\\nexcluded as cumulative of other exhibits admitted at trial,\\n\\nspecifically autopsy photographs. It is well settled, however, that the\\n\\nerroneous admission of evidence that is merely cumulative of other\\n\\nproperly admitted evidence is generally harmless, particularly\\n\\nwhere the evidence of the defendant’s guilt is strong. See, e.g., Allen\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n311 Ga. 439\\n, 452 (2) (\\n858 SE2d 479\\n) (2021) (“Although a party does not waive\\nan error by failing to object to admission of evidence after a motion in limine is\\ndenied, this rule cannot be invoked to preserve a different, if perhaps related,\\nerror.” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n                                        7\\n v. State, \\n310 Ga. 411\\n, 417 (3) (\\n851 SE2d 541\\n) (2020); Smith v. State,\\n\\n307 Ga. 106\\n, 115 (5) (\\n834 SE2d 750\\n) (2019). And here, Madera does\\n\\nnot argue that the autopsy photographs were improperly admitted,\\n\\nand the evidence of his guilt, which included the testimony of\\n\\nmultiple eyewitnesses who rebutted his claim of self-defense, was\\n\\nstrong. Thus, even assuming that it was clear error to admit the\\n\\nfootage showing the injured Zambrano, we conclude that Madera\\n\\n“cannot establish that the error affected his substantial rights\\n\\nbecause he has not made an affirmative showing that the error\\n\\nprobably affected the outcome of his trial.” Allen, 310 Ga. at 416 (3)\\n\\n(rejecting plain error claim where evidence at issue “was cumulative\\n\\nof other unchallenged evidence” and evidence of defendant’s guilt\\n\\nwas strong). See also Jones, 317 Ga. at 473 (2) (appellant failed to\\n\\nshow how alleged erroneous admission of evidence affected his\\n\\nsubstantial rights where the evidence “was cumulative of other\\n\\nproperly admitted evidence at trial” and there was “substantial\\n\\nevidence of [appellant’s] guilt”); Perryman-Henderson v. State, \\n316\\n\\nGa. 626\\n, 632-633 (3) (\\n889 SE2d 814\\n) (2023) (appellant failed to show\\n\\n                                  8\\n how alleged error affected his substantial rights in light of the\\n\\nevidence against him, including eyewitness testimony that was not\\n\\nconsistent with his version of events). Accordingly, this plain error\\n\\nclaim fails.\\n\\n     3. Madera next contends that the State failed to lay a proper\\n\\nfoundation for admitting as a recorded recollection a witness’s\\n\\nvideotaped statement to investigators, see OCGA § 24-8-803 (5), and\\n\\nthat the trial court therefore erred by admitting it. Because Madera\\n\\ndid not object on this ground at trial, 4 we review this claim for plain\\n\\nerror. See Varner v. State, \\n306 Ga. 726\\n, 730 (2) (b) (\\n832 SE2d 792\\n)\\n\\n(2019).\\n\\n     While testifying on direct examination, Saez initially was\\n\\nunable to recall whether Madera said anything to Zambrano as\\n\\nMadera fired his weapon, though Saez had given a videotaped\\n\\nstatement to police shortly after the shooting during which he\\n\\nrecounted that Zambrano “was on the ground, and [Madera] walked\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 At trial, Madera objected to the admission of this evidence only on\\n\\nConfrontation Clause grounds.\\n                                    9\\n up to him and said what’s up now, or what’s up [and] shot him\\n\\nagain.” Pursuant to OCGA § 24-8-803 (5) (“Rule 803 (5)”),5 the State\\n\\nthen moved to admit a portion of Saez’s videotaped statement as a\\n\\npast recollection recorded. Outside the jury’s presence, Saez testified\\n\\nthat he recalled giving the statement, that he watched the recording\\n\\nof the statement, that his memory was “a bit” better when he made\\n\\nthe statement than it was at trial, and that he was truthful when he\\n\\nmade the statement. The trial court found a sufficient foundation to\\n\\nadmit Saez’s videotaped statement, Madera raised no further\\n\\nobjection, and a brief portion of Saez’s statement was played in the\\n\\njury’s presence.\\n\\n      Pointing to Saez’s response that his memory was “a bit” better\\n\\nat the time of the interview, Madera now complains that Saez’s\\n\\n\\n      5 Rule 803 (5) states that the following is not excluded by the general rule\\n\\nagainst hearsay evidence:\\n     [a] memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a\\n     witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection\\n     to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately shown to have\\n     been made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh\\n     in the witness’s memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly. If\\n     admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into evidence\\n     but shall not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an\\n     adverse party[.]\\n                                       10\\n testimony was insufficient to lay a foundation for the admission of\\n\\nthe videotaped statement under Rule 803 (5). As Madera reads it,\\n\\nour decision in Pierce v. State, \\n302 Ga. 389\\n, 391-393 (1) (a) (\\n807 SE2d\\n\\n425\\n) (2017)—the sole case on which Madera relies—held that the\\n\\n“vital element” for laying a foundation under Rule 803 (5) is an\\n\\n“absolute affirmative” statement that the witness’s memory was\\n\\nbetter when the recorded recollection was made. But Pierce imposes\\n\\nno such requirement. Instead, Pierce makes clear that the pertinent\\n\\nanalysis is whether the witness’s testimony “was sufficient to\\n\\nestablish under [Rule 803 (5)] that the [recorded recollection]\\n\\nconcerned a matter about which [the witness] once had knowledge\\n\\nbut at trial had insufficient recollection, which was made or adopted\\n\\nwhen the matter was fresh in his memory, and which correctly\\n\\nreflected his knowledge.” \\n302 Ga. at 392-393\\n (1) (a). As Madera\\n\\npoints to no precedent imposing a requirement that the witness\\n\\ntestify in the “absolute affirmative” that his memory was better\\n\\nwhen the recorded recollection was made and we are aware of none,\\n\\nhe has failed to show that the trial court committed clear and\\n\\n                                  11\\n obvious error, and thus no plain error, in admitting the brief portion\\n\\nof Saez’s interview pursuant to Rule 803 (5). See Clay v. State, \\n309\\n\\nGa. 593\\n, 597 (4) (a) (\\n847 SE2d 530\\n) (2020) (“[A]n error cannot be\\n\\nplain where there is no controlling authority on point.” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     4. Madera argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally\\n\\nineffective in two ways. To succeed on these claims, Madera must\\n\\nshow both that trial counsel’s performance was deficient and that he\\n\\nsuffered prejudice as a result. See Strickland v. Washington, \\n466\\n\\nU. S. 668\\n, 687 (III) (B) (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984). To\\n\\nestablish deficiency, Madera “must demonstrate that his attorney\\n\\nperformed at trial in an objectively unreasonable way considering\\n\\nall the circumstances and in the light of prevailing professional\\n\\nnorms.” Pope v. State, \\n311 Ga. 557\\n, 559 (\\n858 SE2d 492\\n) (2021)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). “[D]ecisions regarding trial\\n\\ntactics and strategy may form the basis for an ineffectiveness claim\\n\\nonly if they were so patently unreasonable that no competent\\n\\nattorney would have followed such a course.” Davis v. State, \\n299 Ga.\\n\\n12\\n\\n 180, 183 (2) (\\n787 SE2d 221\\n) (2016) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). To establish prejudice, Madera must show a reasonable\\n\\nprobability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance, the result\\n\\nat trial would have been different. See Strickland, \\n466 U. S. at 694\\n\\n\\n(III) (B). “We need not address both components of the inquiry if the\\n\\ndefendant makes an insufficient showing on one.” Suggs v. State,\\n\\n310 Ga. 762\\n, 768 (7) (\\n853 SE2d 674\\n) (2021). “[A] trial court’s factual\\n\\nfindings made in the course of deciding an ineffective assistance of\\n\\ncounsel claim will be affirmed by the reviewing court unless clearly\\n\\nerroneous,” while “[c]onclusions of law based on those facts are\\n\\nreviewed de novo.” Taylor v. State, \\n315 Ga. 630\\n, 647 (5) (b) (\\n884 SE2d\\n\\n346\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     (a) Madera contends that trial counsel did not conduct an\\n\\nadequate investigation of his case, pointing to a litany of actions\\n\\nthat, he says, counsel failed to undertake in preparing the case for\\n\\ntrial. But even assuming that counsel’s investigation was\\n\\ninadequate, Madera “has not suggested, much less shown, what\\n\\nfurther investigation would have revealed or how it would have\\n\\n                                 13\\n helped his defense” and, thus, “has failed to prove the required\\n\\nprejudice.” Suggs, 310 Ga. at 768 (7) (a). See also Lupoe v. State, \\n300\\n\\nGa. 233\\n, 241 (2) (b) (\\n794 SE2d 67\\n) (2016) (“To show prejudice on a\\n\\nclaim that trial counsel failed to adequately investigate the case, [a\\n\\ndefendant must] at least make a proffer as to what additional\\n\\ninvestigation would have uncovered, and not merely speculate that\\n\\nsuch information exists and would have made a difference.” (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)). Accordingly, his argument that trial\\n\\ncounsel was ineffective on this ground fails.\\n\\n     (b) Madera also contends that trial counsel was ineffective for\\n\\nfailing to pursue a pretrial motion for immunity based on\\n\\njustification. See OCGA § 16-3-24.2 (“A person who uses threats or\\n\\nforce in accordance with [certain statutes governing justification as\\n\\na defense, including self-defense,] shall be immune from criminal\\n\\nprosecution therefor unless in the use of deadly force, such person\\n\\nutilizes a weapon the carrying or possession of which is unlawful by\\n\\nsuch person under [OCGA §§ 16-11-120 to 16-11-125].”). In rejecting\\n\\nthis claim below, the trial court credited counsel’s testimony at the\\n\\n                                  14\\n motion-for-new-trial hearing that he “believed [Madera] was\\n\\nunlikely to prevail in an immunity motion” and “wanted the State\\n\\nto have to grapple with [Madera’s] theory of defense and [Madera’s]\\n\\ntestimony for the first time at trial.” On that basis, the trial court\\n\\nconcluded that counsel made a reasonable strategic decision not to\\n\\npursue such a motion and that Madera had failed to establish that\\n\\ncounsel’s decision was unreasonable.\\n\\n     On appeal, Madera, pointing to his own testimony at the\\n\\nmotion-for-new-trial hearing, argues only that trial counsel “did not\\n\\nthoroughly discuss with him the prospect of filing [a pre-trial\\n\\nimmunity] motion” and that he “disagreed” with counsel’s strategy.\\n\\nBut Madera’s after-the-fact disagreement with trial counsel’s\\n\\nstrategy does not mean that the strategy was objectively\\n\\nunreasonable. See Szorcsik v. State, \\n303 Ga. 737\\n, 743 (5) (\\n814 SE2d\\n\\n708\\n) (2018) (“[T]he fact that the trial counsel . . . made certain\\n\\ndifficult decisions regarding the defense tactics to be employed with\\n\\nwhich appellant and his present counsel now disagree does not\\n\\nrequire a finding that the representation below was so inadequate\\n\\n                                 15\\n as to amount to a denial of effective assistance of counsel.” (citations\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)). Madera otherwise makes no attempt to\\n\\nshow “how his trial counsel’s strategic decision not to reveal the\\n\\ndefense theory to the prosecutor before trial, and instead to wait and\\n\\npresent [the] self-defense claim to the jury, was objectively\\n\\nunreasonable.” Pope, 311 Ga. at 560-561 (where trial counsel\\n\\ntestified that “she did not think that the trial judge would find [a\\n\\npretrial immunity motion] sufficiently compelling to grant [and] just\\n\\nsaved it for trial,” appellant failed to show that counsel’s strategic\\n\\ndecision was unreasonable); see also Dent v. State, \\n303 Ga. 110\\n, 119\\n\\n(4) (d) (\\n810 SE2d 527\\n) (2018) (where trial counsel testified that he\\n\\nstrategically decided to forgo filing a pretrial immunity motion “as\\n\\nhe did not want to expose [appellant] to pre-trial cross-examination\\n\\nfrom the State, thereby previewing [appellant’s] anticipated trial\\n\\ntestimony, and that he chose to attempt to demonstrate self-defense\\n\\nto the jury, as opposed to the judge,” appellant failed to show that\\n\\ncounsel’s “tactical decision was unreasonable”). Madera thus has\\n\\nfailed to show that counsel’s performance was constitutionally\\n\\n                                  16\\n deficient, and this claim fails.\\n\\n     5. Finally, Madera argues that the cumulative effect of the trial\\n\\ncourt’s errors and trial counsel’s deficient performance requires a\\n\\nnew trial. But here, we have identified no trial court error, and we\\n\\nhave assumed deficiency with respect to only one alleged instance of\\n\\ncounsel’s ineffective assistance and concluded that Madera failed to\\n\\nshow he was prejudiced thereby. Thus, “there are no errors to\\n\\naggregate, and his claim of cumulative error also fails.” Blocker v.\\n\\nState, \\n316 Ga. 568\\n, 583 (5) (\\n889 SE2d 824\\n) (2023).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

PALMER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       BOGGS, Chief Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Willie Williams Palmer challenges his 2023\\n\\nconvictions for malice murder and other crimes in connection with\\n\\nthe shooting deaths of his estranged wife, Brenda Jenkins Palmer,\\n\\nand his 15-year-old stepdaughter, Christine Jenkins. He contends\\n\\nthat his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated; that\\n\\nthe State’s loss or destruction of potential biological evidence from\\n\\nthe crime scene required dismissal for prosecutorial misconduct or\\n\\nan instruction allowing the jury to draw an inference adverse to the\\n\\nState; that the trial court violated his constitutional right to present\\n\\na defense by excluding evidence of “historical bias against him on\\n\\nthe part of local law enforcement and prosecutors”; that the court\\n\\nerred in prohibiting him from questioning the lead GBI investigator\\n about a shooting two months after the murders to support his theory\\n\\nof an alternative suspect and his argument that the investigators\\n\\nunfairly focused on him as the shooter to the exclusion of other\\n\\npossible suspects; and that the cumulative effect of the court’s errors\\n\\ndeprived him of a fundamentally fair trial. For the reasons that\\n\\nfollow, we affirm.1\\n\\n\\n      1 The crimes occurred on the night of September 10, 1995. On April 17,\\n\\n1996, a Burke County grand jury indicted Appellant on two counts of malice\\nmurder, two counts of felony murder, and one count each of burglary,\\nkidnapping, child cruelty, possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\ncrime, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Appellant’s first trial\\nin April 1997 ended in a mistrial.\\n      At Appellant’s second trial in late October and early November 1997, the\\njury found him guilty of all charges, and he was sentenced to death. He\\nappealed, and this Court affirmed. See Palmer v. State, \\n271 Ga. 234\\n (\\n517 SE2d\\n502\\n) (1999). Appellant then filed a petition for habeas corpus, which the habeas\\ncourt granted, and this Court affirmed the grant of habeas relief. See Schofield\\nv. Palmer, \\n279 Ga. 848\\n (\\n621 SE2d 726\\n) (2005).\\n      At Appellant’s third trial in August 2007, he was again found guilty of\\nall charges and sentenced to death. Appellant filed a motion for new trial,\\nwhich he amended in 2014, 2015, and 2016. In November 2019, the trial court\\ndenied the motion. The trial court granted Appellant’s request for a 30-day\\nextension of time to file a notice of appeal, and in January 2020, Appellant filed\\na timely notice of appeal.\\n      In August 2020, this Court granted the parties’ Joint Motion to Vacate\\nthe Denial of Motion for New Trial and Remand to Enter Consent Judgment\\nGranting a New Trial. On December 14, 2020, the remittitur from this Court\\nwas filed in the trial court. On July 7, 2021, the trial court entered a Consent\\nOrder Granting Defendant’s Motion for New Trial.\\n      At Appellant’s fourth trial from February 2 to 15, 2023, the jury found\\nhim guilty of all charges and determined that he is not a person with\\n\\n                                        2\\n       1.    The evidence at Appellant’s fourth trial showed as\\n\\nfollows. Appellant married Brenda Jenkins Palmer in May 1993,\\n\\nand they had a daughter, Willshala, in 1994. In May 1995, Brenda\\n\\nPalmer separated from Appellant and filed for divorce, and the\\n\\nfollowing day, Appellant was served with a restraining order to stay\\n\\naway from her. Meanwhile, Brenda Palmer stayed with family and\\n\\nat some point moved with her daughters, 15-year-old Christine and\\n\\none-year-old Willshala, into a two-room house in Vidette. Appellant\\n\\nowned five acres of land and told numerous people that he would kill\\n\\nBrenda Palmer if she tried to take it from him.\\n\\n      On July 31, 1995, Appellant was arrested for violating the\\n\\nrestraining order and put in jail. At the end of August 1995, Brenda\\n\\nPalmer met with the manager of a small loan company to catch up\\n\\n\\n\\nintellectual disability. On February 15, 2023, the trial court sentenced\\nAppellant to serve consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of\\nparole for the malice murders, concurrent terms of 20 years each for burglary,\\nkidnapping, and child cruelty, a concurrent term of five years for possession of\\na firearm by a convicted felon, and a consecutive term of five years for\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a crime; the felony murder\\ncounts were vacated by operation of law. On the same day, Appellant filed a\\ntimely notice of appeal. The case was docketed in this Court for the August\\n2023 term and was orally argued on October 26, 2023.\\n                                       3\\n on her payments and update her address. She was very nervous and\\n\\nupset during the meeting, and the manager promised not to give out\\n\\nher address to anyone.\\n\\n     On September 1, 1995, Appellant was released from jail, and\\n\\nhe immediately went to the same small loan company to borrow\\n\\nmoney to pay a lawyer. He asked the manager if she had seen\\n\\nBrenda Palmer, and the manager did not reply. He then asked the\\n\\nmanager if she knew where Brenda Palmer was living, and again\\n\\nthe manager did not reply. Appellant told the manager twice that\\n\\nshe did not have to tell him where Brenda Palmer was, because “I\\n\\nwill find her. And, when I do, I’ll kill that b**ch.” Appellant’s\\n\\ndemeanor was “cold” and “hard,” and he looked different than the\\n\\nmanager had ever seen him before.\\n\\n     Appellant also was angry with Brenda Smith. Appellant and\\n\\nBrenda Smith had been in a relationship for 12 to 14 years before\\n\\nAppellant married Brenda Palmer, and Appellant and Brenda\\n\\nSmith had three children together. When Brenda Palmer moved out\\n\\nand filed for divorce, Brenda Smith moved back in with Appellant.\\n\\n                                4\\n On September 7, 1995, Appellant told Emma Ruth Brown that he\\n\\nwas going to “kill all the Brendas,” that he was going to do it\\n\\n“execution style,” and that she would “see it on TV.”\\n\\n     On the afternoon of Sunday, September 10, 1995, Brenda\\n\\nSmith’s niece, Letrichia Smith, overheard Appellant ask his\\n\\nnephew, Frederico Palmer, and his son, Wilbur Palmer, where his\\n\\ngun was. Appellant said that he was “going to kill . . . the two\\n\\nBrendas.” Appellant then went and spoke with Brenda Smith, who\\n\\nseemed afraid afterward. Not long after that, Appellant got into his\\n\\ncar and chased Brenda Smith, who was a passenger in her sister’s\\n\\ncar, and Appellant ran into the back of the car. Brenda Smith fled\\n\\nher sister’s car on foot, and Appellant angrily approached her sister\\n\\nand told her that she “didn’t know who the f**k [she] was messing\\n\\nwith.”\\n\\n     That night, Appellant met up with Frederico at a club in Gough\\n\\ncalled Soul City and asked Frederico to ride with him to Augusta.\\n\\nFrederico agreed and got into Appellant’s blue Chevy Caprice, but\\n\\nAppellant drove towards Vidette instead of Augusta. Appellant\\n\\n                                  5\\n asked Frederico, “Do you think I should kill Brenda and Christine?”\\n\\nFrederico did not answer.\\n\\n     When they got to Vidette, Appellant parked his car on the side\\n\\nof the road near the Vidette Country Store, which was close to\\n\\nBrenda Palmer’s house. Appellant put on gloves, pulled out his .22-\\n\\ncaliber rifle, and exited the car. At Appellant’s direction, Frederico\\n\\nparked the car near some dumpsters and caught up to Appellant on\\n\\nfoot outside Brenda Palmer’s house. At Appellant’s request,\\n\\nFrederico disconnected the telephone line on the side of the house,\\n\\nmaking the telephone inside the house inoperable.\\n\\n     Appellant then went to the front door, knocked twice, and when\\n\\nthere was no answer, he kicked in the door and turned on the light.\\n\\nChristine, whose nickname was “Bootie,” was sleeping on a bed in\\n\\nthe living room, and Appellant called out, “Bootie, I told y’all I was\\n\\ncoming back.” Appellant shot Christine once in the face with the\\n\\nrifle, killing her. Appellant then went into the back room, where the\\n\\ntelephone receiver was off the hook and Brenda Palmer was holding\\n\\nWillshala. Appellant directed Frederico to take the baby, and\\n\\n                                  6\\n Frederico complied, knocking Brenda Palmer to the floor. Frederico\\n\\ntook the baby outside, and Appellant shot Brenda Palmer twice in\\n\\nthe head, killing her. Frederico came back inside and, at Appellant’s\\n\\ndirection, put the baby down and checked to see if Brenda Palmer\\n\\nhad a pulse; she did not. Appellant and Frederico turned out the\\n\\nlight and left, leaving Willshala in the house.\\n\\n     Frederico went and got the car and picked up Appellant.\\n\\nAppellant concocted an alibi, telling Frederico to say that they had\\n\\ndriven straight from Gough to Augusta, where they spent the\\n\\nevening visiting Belle Walker. Appellant and Frederico drove to\\n\\nAppellant’s house, where Appellant changed clothes, before driving\\n\\non towards Augusta. Along the way, they stopped at Brushy Creek\\n\\nBridge, where Appellant got out and threw his rifle and the gloves\\n\\nand shoes that he was wearing at the time of the murders over the\\n\\nside of the bridge. Later, they stopped at a gas station for cigarettes\\n\\nbefore going to Walker’s apartment, where they knocked on the door,\\n\\nbut no one answered. Appellant and Frederico then drove back to\\n\\nGough. That night, Frederico told Kelvin Jenkins what had\\n\\n                                  7\\n happened and said that he was scared that Appellant was going to\\n\\nkill him.\\n\\n     At around 7:00 a.m. on Monday, September 11, 1995, Brenda\\n\\nPalmer’s sister, Jellen Jenkins, discovered the bodies of her sister\\n\\nand Christine and took Willshala out of the house. Within an hour\\n\\nor so, GBI Special Agent David Leonard began processing the crime\\n\\nscene. He noticed a small amount of a milky white liquid between\\n\\nChristine’s legs, but by the time he went to collect it, the substance\\n\\nhad dissipated. Agent Leonard wiped the skin in the area with two\\n\\nsterile gauze pads, one dry and one moistened with a saline solution,\\n\\nin an attempt to collect any remnants of the liquid for testing for the\\n\\npresence of seminal fluid. The gauze pads later tested negative for\\n\\nseminal fluid.\\n\\n     At noon on the day the bodies were discovered, the lead GBI\\n\\ninvestigator, Special Agent Anthony Williamson, interviewed\\n\\nAppellant at the Burke County Sheriff’s Office. Appellant said that\\n\\nthe night before, he met up with Frederico a little after 9:00 p.m.\\n\\nAccording to Appellant, Frederico then rode with him to Augusta in\\n\\n                                  8\\n Appellant’s blue Chevy Caprice to see a woman, who was not home,\\n\\nso they drove back to Gough, arriving around 12:55 a.m. At 3:30 p.m.\\n\\non September 11, 1995, Agent Williamson interviewed Frederico,\\n\\nwho related essentially the same story as Appellant about riding to\\n\\nAugusta the prior evening.\\n\\n     On September 13, 1995, Agent Williamson interviewed\\n\\nFrederico again.    Frederico   confessed his    involvement    with\\n\\nAppellant in the murders and then led law enforcement officers to\\n\\nBrushy Creek Bridge, where they recovered a rifle from the creek\\n\\nbelow. Two days later, Frederico told Agent Williamson that\\n\\nAppellant threw the gloves and shoes that he was wearing at the\\n\\ntime of the murders over the side of the bridge along with the rifle,\\n\\nand the gloves and shoes were then recovered. The shoes from the\\n\\ncreek matched Appellant’s shoe size.\\n\\n     Ballistics testing showed that two shell casings found at the\\n\\ncrime scene were fired from the rifle recovered from the creek and\\n\\nthat the bullet removed from Christine’s skull during an autopsy,\\n\\nhalf of which was missing, “was probably fired from that gun.” The\\n\\n                                 9\\n same rifle had been temporarily confiscated from Appellant during\\n\\na traffic stop in 1992.\\n\\n     Randy Waltower, a paid confidential informant for the GBI in\\n\\ndrug operations, identified Appellant’s car as having been in the\\n\\narea near Brenda Palmer’s house on the night of the murders.\\n\\nAppellant’s car was easily recognizable, because it was missing part\\n\\nof its front grille. Thomas Parrish was with Waltower and also saw\\n\\nAppellant’s car. Pamela Parker, who worked at the Vidette Country\\n\\nStore, confirmed that Waltower and Parrish were in the area that\\n\\nnight. Frederico saw Waltower as well. The GBI later paid Waltower\\n\\n$500 for the information he provided about Appellant and for his\\n\\nassistance in two other matters.\\n\\n     On September 19, 1995, GBI Special Agent Robert Ingram,\\n\\nAgent Williamson’s supervisor, interviewed Appellant, who denied\\n\\nany involvement in the murders. Near the end of the interview,\\n\\nAgent Ingram asked Appellant if he had “spoken to the Lord about\\n\\nwhat he had done,” and Appellant said that he had. Agent Ingram\\n\\nasked Appellant, “[D]id you tell the Lord the truth when you talked\\n\\n                                   10\\n to him?” Appellant said that he did. Agent Ingram then asked if that\\n\\nwas different from what Appellant had told the investigators,\\n\\nincluding Agent Ingram, and Appellant said, “Yeah, it was\\n\\ndifferent.” At that point, Appellant said that he wanted to go back\\n\\nto his jail cell, and Agent Ingram ended the interview.\\n\\n     The following month, on October 26, 1995, Frederico pled\\n\\nguilty to two counts of felony murder and was sentenced to serve two\\n\\nconsecutive terms of life in prison. In exchange for his plea,\\n\\nFrederico agreed to cooperate fully and testify truthfully against\\n\\nAppellant.\\n\\n     2.   Appellant contends that the trial court erred in rejecting\\n\\nhis claim that the State violated his Sixth Amendment right to a\\n\\nspeedy trial. We disagree.\\n\\n     The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\n\\nprovides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\\n\\nthe right to a speedy . . . trial.” Sixth Amendment speedy trial claims\\n\\nare analyzed under the two-part framework set out in Barker v.\\n\\nWingo, \\n407 U.S. 514\\n (92 SCt 2182, 33 LE2d 101) (1972), and Doggett\\n\\n                                  11\\n v. United States, \\n505 U.S. 647\\n (112 SCt 2686, 120 LE2d 520) (1992).\\n\\nFirst, the trial court must determine whether the delay at issue was\\n\\nsufficiently long to be considered presumptively prejudicial. See\\n\\nBarker, \\n407 U.S. at 530-531\\n; Doggett, \\n505 U.S. at\\n651-652 & n.1. If\\n\\nnot, the claim fails at the threshold. See Ruffin v. State, \\n284 Ga. 52\\n,\\n\\n55 (\\n663 SE2d 189\\n) (2008) (citing Barker, \\n407 U.S. at 530\\n; Doggett,\\n\\n505 U.S. at\\n652 n.1). But if the delay has passed the point of\\n\\npresumptive prejudice, the trial court must proceed to the second\\n\\nstep of the Barker-Doggett analysis. See \\nid.\\n\\n\\n     The second step of the Barker-Doggett analysis requires the\\n\\napplication of a context-sensitive balancing test to determine\\n\\nwhether the defendant has been deprived of his right to a speedy\\n\\ntrial. See \\nid.\\n The four factors that form the core of this balancing test\\n\\nare: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the\\n\\ndefendant’s assertion of the right; and (4) prejudice to the defendant\\n\\nfrom the delay. See Barker, \\n407 U.S. at 530\\n; Ruffin, \\n284 Ga. at 56\\n.\\n\\nSee also Doggett, \\n505 U.S. at 651\\n (describing the four core factors as\\n\\n“whether [the] delay before trial was uncommonly long, whether the\\n\\n                                   12\\n government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for that\\n\\ndelay, whether, in due course, the defendant asserted his right to a\\n\\nspeedy trial, and whether [the defendant] suffered prejudice as the\\n\\ndelay’s result”).\\n\\n     Application of the Barker-Doggett balancing test to particular\\n\\ncases is committed to the sound discretion of the trial courts. See\\n\\nHeard v. State, \\n295 Ga. 559\\n, 563 (\\n761 SE2d 314\\n) (2014). Thus, on\\n\\nappeal from a ruling on a speedy trial claim, we accept the trial\\n\\ncourt’s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, and we\\n\\nreview the trial court’s evaluation of each factor and its “balancing\\n\\nof [the] factors – its ultimate judgment” – “only for abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion.” Williams v. State, \\n314 Ga. 671\\n, 678 (\\n878 SE2d 553\\n)\\n\\n(2022).\\n\\n     (a)   Length of the Delay and Presumptive Prejudice.\\n\\n           (i)      The Sixth Amendment speedy trial right “does not\\n\\nattach until . . . a defendant is arrested or formally accused.”\\n\\nBetterman v. Montana, \\n578 U.S. 437\\n, 441 (136 SCt 1609, 194 LE2d\\n\\n723) (2016) (citing United States v. Marion, \\n404 U.S. 307\\n, 320-321\\n\\n                                   13\\n (92 SCt 455, 30 LE2d 468) (1971)). Thus, the length of the delay\\n\\nordinarily is measured from the earlier of the date of the defendant’s\\n\\narrest or indictment (or other formal accusation) to the date that his\\n\\ntrial started. See Ruffin, \\n284 Ga. at 55\\n. See also 5 Wayne R. LaFave\\n\\net al., Criminal Procedure § 18.2 (b) (4th ed. Dec. 2023 update) (“In\\n\\nthe usual case, [determining the length of the delay] is simply a\\n\\nmatter of calculating the time which has elapsed from when the\\n\\nSixth Amendment right attached until trial (or, until the pretrial\\n\\nmotion to dismiss on this ground is determined).” (footnotes\\n\\nomitted)). However, the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right\\n\\n“detaches upon conviction.” Betterman, 578 U.S. at 441. See also id.\\n\\nat 442 (“As a measure protecting the presumptively innocent, the\\n\\nspeedy trial right . . . loses force upon conviction.”). Like delay prior\\n\\nto arrest or indictment, the “adverse consequences of postconviction\\n\\ndelay, though subject to other checks [such as due process], are . . .\\n\\noutside the purview of the Speedy Trial Clause.” Id. at 444 (cleaned\\n\\nup). See also id. at 448-449 (“The Sixth Amendment speedy trial\\n\\nright . . . does not extend beyond conviction, which terminates the\\n\\n                                   14\\n presumption of innocence.”). Cf. Chatman v. Mancill, \\n280 Ga. 253\\n,\\n\\n256 (\\n626 SE2d 102\\n) (2006) (“Substantial delays experienced during\\n\\nthe criminal appellate process implicate due process rights.”\\n\\n(cleaned up)).\\n\\n     The United States Supreme Court has expressly reserved\\n\\ndecision on whether the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right\\n\\n“reattaches upon renewed prosecution following a defendant’s\\n\\nsuccessful appeal, when he again enjoys the presumption of\\n\\ninnocence.” Betterman, 578 U.S. at 441 n.2. We have never directly\\n\\naddressed whether the speedy trial right reattaches after a\\n\\nconviction is set aside by the grant of a new trial or reversal on\\n\\nappeal, but we have assumed without deciding that it does reattach.\\n\\nSee generally Jakupovic v. State, \\n287 Ga. 205\\n (\\n695 SE2d 247\\n) (2010)\\n\\n(new trial); State v. Carr, \\n278 Ga. 124\\n (\\n598 SE2d 468\\n) (2004)\\n\\n(reversal on appeal). When a speedy trial claim is raised following a\\n\\nretrial, the length of the delay is measured from the date of the order\\n\\ngranting a new trial or the return of the case from the appellate\\n\\ncourt to the date that the retrial started. See Jakupovic, \\n287 Ga. at\\n\\n15\\n 206 (new trial); Carr, \\n278 Ga. at 126\\n (reversal on appeal). See also 5\\n\\nWayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure § 18.1 (c) (4th ed. Dec.\\n\\n2023 update) (stating that “[i]f, following conviction, defendant’s\\n\\nmotion for a new trial is granted, the length of delay in retrying the\\n\\ndefendant is measured from the date that the trial court ruled on\\n\\ndefendant’s motion,” and that “[u]pon appellate reversal of a\\n\\nconviction, the speedy trial clock regarding retrial generally starts\\n\\nas of the time of remand” (internal quotation marks omitted)); 23\\n\\nCJS Criminal Procedure and Rights of Accused § 798 (Nov. 2023\\n\\nupdate) (“The time for speedily bringing a defendant to trial,\\n\\npursuant to an order granting a new trial, begins to run anew after\\n\\nthe order is entered.”).\\n\\n           (ii)   At Appellant’s third trial in 2007, he was found\\n\\nguilty of two counts of malice murder and other crimes and\\n\\nsentenced to death. He filed a motion for new trial, which he\\n\\namended in 2014, 2015, and 2016. In November 2019, the trial court\\n\\ndenied the motion, and he appealed to this Court. On August 7,\\n\\n2020, the parties filed in this Court a Joint Motion to Vacate the\\n\\n                                 16\\n Denial of Motion for New Trial and Remand to Enter Consent\\n\\nJudgment Granting a New Trial. On August 24, 2020, this Court\\n\\ngranted the motion, vacated the trial court’s order denying\\n\\nAppellant’s motion for new trial, and remanded the case to the trial\\n\\ncourt for further proceedings. On December 14, 2020, the remittitur\\n\\nfrom this Court was filed in the trial court. On July 7, 2021, the trial\\n\\ncourt entered a Consent Order Granting Defendant’s Motion for\\n\\nNew Trial.\\n\\n     The trial court measured the length of the delay from the filing\\n\\nof the remittitur on December 14, 2020, to the start of Appellant’s\\n\\nfourth trial on February 2, 2023, a period of approximately two years\\n\\nand two months, and ruled that this delay was presumptively\\n\\nprejudicial. However, this Court did not set aside Appellant’s\\n\\nconvictions on appeal following his third trial. Instead, we granted\\n\\nthe parties’ joint motion, vacated the trial court’s order denying\\n\\nAppellant’s motion for new trial, and remanded the case to the trial\\n\\ncourt for further proceedings. On July 7, 2021, the trial court entered\\n\\nthe parties’ consent order granting Appellant a new trial. Only then\\n\\n                                  17\\n did Appellant again enjoy the presumption of innocence. Moreover,\\n\\nuntil his convictions were set aside by the grant of a new trial,\\n\\ndouble jeopardy barred him from being retried. See Currier v.\\n\\nVirginia, \\n585 U.S. 493\\n, 501 (138 SCt 2144, 201 LE2d 650) (2018)\\n\\n(“As a general rule, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against a\\n\\nsecond prosecution for the same offense after conviction as well as\\n\\nagainst a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.”\\n\\n(cleaned up)). The Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment did\\n\\nnot require the State to attempt to retry Appellant at a time when\\n\\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment barred his\\n\\nretrial. The trial court therefore should have measured the length of\\n\\nthe delay from the entry of the order granting him a new trial on\\n\\nJuly 7, 2021, to the start of his fourth trial on February 2, 2023, a\\n\\nperiod of approximately one year and seven months.\\n\\n     “One year generally marks the point at which expected\\n\\ndeliberateness in the prosecution of a criminal matter turns into\\n\\npresumptively prejudicial delay.” Ruffin, \\n284 Ga. at 55\\n (cleaned up).\\n\\nThus, the trial court did not err in ruling that the delay at issue was\\n\\n                                  18\\n sufficiently long to be considered presumptively prejudicial. And\\n\\nbecause the trial court’s legal error in measuring the length of the\\n\\ndelay favored Appellant, the error does not undermine the\\n\\nreasonableness of the trial court’s ultimate judgment denying his\\n\\nspeedy trial claim.\\n\\n          (iii) Appellant agrees that the trial court erred in\\n\\nmeasuring the length of the delay but claims that the error was in\\n\\nthe opposite direction. Appellant argues that the trial court should\\n\\nhave measured the length of the delay from his arrest on July 31,\\n\\n1995, to the start of his fourth trial on February 2, 2023, a period of\\n\\nmore than 27 years. He notes that his first trial in April 1997 ended\\n\\nin a mistrial when it was discovered that the State had failed to\\n\\ndisclose a statement by Frederico that contradicted his trial\\n\\ntestimony and that his convictions from his second trial in October\\n\\nand November 1997 were vacated on habeas due to the State’s\\n\\nfailure to disclose the GBI’s $500 payment to Waltower. See Brady\\n\\nv. Maryland, \\n373 U.S. 83\\n, 87 (83 SCt 1194, 10 LE2d 215) (1963)\\n\\n(holding that due process requires the prosecution to disclose to the\\n\\n                                  19\\n defense material, exculpatory evidence that is within its possession\\n\\nor control). Appellant also asserts that there was reversible error in\\n\\nhis third trial in August 2007 due to the State’s failure to disclose\\n\\nthat an expert witness who had previously testified that Appellant\\n\\nwas not intellectually disabled had since revised his opinion and\\n\\nconcluded that Appellant was, in fact, mildly intellectually disabled.\\n\\nAppellant contends that because his first three trials were tainted\\n\\nby prosecutorial misconduct in the form of Brady violations, the\\n\\nlength of the delay for purposes of his speedy trial claim should\\n\\ninclude the entire period from his arrest in 1995 to the start of his\\n\\nfourth trial in 2023.\\n\\n     Appellant’s argument appears to conflict with precedent from\\n\\nthe United States Supreme Court and this Court. See Betterman,\\n\\n578 U.S. at 439 (“We hold that the [Sixth Amendment speedy trial]\\n\\nguarantee protects the accused from arrest or indictment through\\n\\ntrial, but does not apply once a defendant has been found guilty at\\n\\ntrial or has pleaded guilty to criminal charges.”); Jenkins v. State,\\n\\n294 Ga. 506\\n, 510 (\\n755 SE2d 138\\n) (2014) (rejecting argument that\\n\\n                                 20\\n because of Brady violations at the defendant’s first trial, the length\\n\\nof the delay should be measured from the date of the defendant’s\\n\\narrest instead of the date of the remittitur from this Court following\\n\\naffirmance of the habeas court’s judgment setting aside the\\n\\ndefendant’s convictions); Carr, \\n278 Ga. at 126\\n (measuring the length\\n\\nof the delay “from the return of this case to the trial court after this\\n\\nCourt’s 1997 reversal of [the defendant’s] convictions” where this\\n\\nCourt had concluded in the defendant’s direct appeal that the record\\n\\nsupported several of his allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, see\\n\\nCarr v. State, \\n267 Ga. 701\\n, 711-712 (\\n482 SE2d 314\\n) (1997), overruled\\n\\non other grounds by Clark v. State, \\n271 Ga. 6\\n, 10 (\\n515 SE2d 155\\n)\\n\\n(1999)). See also Betterman, 578 U.S. at 444 (“Adverse consequences\\n\\nof postconviction delay, though subject to other checks, are . . .\\n\\noutside the purview of the Speedy Trial Clause.” (citation omitted)).\\n\\nHowever, we need not decide here whether a series of Brady\\n\\nviolations resulting in retrials ever justifies consideration of periods\\n\\nof time prior to the grant of a new trial or the setting aside of a\\n\\ndefendant’s convictions on appeal in evaluating a speedy trial claim.\\n\\n                                  21\\n See Pelletier v. Warden, \\n627 A2d 1363\\n, 1372 (Conn. App. Ct. 1993)\\n\\n(suggesting, before Betterman, that where the prosecutorial\\n\\nmisconduct that resulted in the reversal of the defendant’s\\n\\nconvictions was “motivated by a desire to cause additional delay or\\n\\notherwise impair the [defendant’s] speedy trial rights,” the time\\n\\nprior to the reversal may be included in the length of the delay).\\n\\n     As explained above, after Appellant’s third trial, where the jury\\n\\nfound him guilty of two counts of malice murder and other crimes\\n\\nand he was again sentenced to death, he appealed to this Court.\\n\\nWhile his appeal was pending, the parties filed in this Court a Joint\\n\\nMotion to Vacate the Denial of Motion for New Trial and Remand to\\n\\nEnter Consent Judgment Granting a New Trial, which we granted.\\n\\nThe remittitur from this Court was filed in the trial court, and on\\n\\nJuly 7, 2021, the trial court entered a consent order granting\\n\\nAppellant a new trial. Thus, rather than running the risk that at the\\n\\nend of his appeal, this Court might reject his claims and affirm his\\n\\nconvictions and death sentence, Appellant decided to enter into an\\n\\nagreement with the State in which the State agreed to the grant of\\n\\n                                 22\\n a new trial and not to seek the death penalty at Appellant’s fourth\\n\\ntrial, and Appellant agreed to be retried and to be eligible for a\\n\\nsentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The\\n\\nparties explicitly agreed to further proceedings “to entail a jury trial\\n\\nas to the question of criminal responsibility and a sentencing\\n\\ndetermination to be made by the trial court.” The proposed consent\\n\\norder attached to the parties’ joint motion, which was later entered\\n\\nby the trial court, explained in the first sentence that the order was\\n\\n“[b]ased upon agreement and consent of the parties that reversible\\n\\nerror in the trial proceedings of this matter warrant a new trial”\\n\\n(emphasis added); specifically referred to “trial proceedings to\\n\\nfollow” and a “re-trial”; and referenced a “new trial” three times.\\n\\nUnder these unique circumstances, we conclude that Appellant has\\n\\nwaived any argument that periods prior to the entry of the consent\\n\\norder should be included in the length of the delay in evaluating his\\n\\nspeedy trial claim raised in connection with his fourth trial,\\n\\nregardless of the violations of his Brady rights in his previous trials.\\n\\nSee Currier, 585 U.S. at 501-502 (“Retrial is generally allowed when\\n\\n                                  23\\n the defendant consents to a disposition that contemplates\\n\\nreprosecution.” (cleaned up)).\\n\\n     (b)   Barker-Doggett Balancing Test.\\n\\n           (i)   Length of the Delay Beyond the Point of Presumptive\\n\\nPrejudice. Appellant argues that the trial court erred in weighing\\n\\nthe length-of-the-delay factor “only slightly against the State.” In\\n\\napplying the Barker-Doggett balancing test, the trial court was\\n\\nrequired to consider, as one factor among several, “the extent to\\n\\nwhich the delay stretche[d] beyond the bare minimum needed to\\n\\ntrigger judicial examination of [Appellant’s Sixth Amendment\\n\\nspeedy trial] claim.” Doggett, \\n505 U.S. at 652\\n. As explained above,\\n\\nthe trial court should have measured the length of the delay from\\n\\nthe entry of the order granting him a new trial on July 7, 2021, to\\n\\nthe start of his fourth trial on February 2, 2023, a period of\\n\\napproximately one year and seven months.\\n\\n     The trial court made no express finding regarding the extent to\\n\\nwhich this one-year-and-seven-month delay stretched beyond the\\n\\npoint of presumptive prejudice. However,\\n\\n                                 24\\n      a delay approaching one year is sufficient in most cases to\\n     raise a presumption of prejudice and to warrant a more\\n     searching inquiry, keeping in mind that the delay that\\n     can be tolerated in a particular case depends to some\\n     extent on the complexity and seriousness of the charges.\\n\\nHeard, \\n295 Ga. at 564-565\\n (cleaned up). Thus, at most, the length of\\n\\nthe delay extended beyond the point of presumptive prejudice by a\\n\\nspan of only seven months. We see no abuse of discretion in the trial\\n\\ncourt’s decision to weigh the length-of-the-delay factor only slightly\\n\\nagainst the State in the balancing test. See Doggett, \\n505 U.S. at\\n655-\\n\\n656 (“While . . . presumptive prejudice cannot alone carry a Sixth\\n\\nAmendment [speedy trial] claim without regard to the other Barker\\n\\ncriteria, it is part of the mix of relevant facts, and its importance\\n\\nincreases with the length of delay.” (citation omitted)); United States\\n\\nv. Otero, No. 23-1266, \\n2023 WL 8947133\\n, at *1 (8th Cir. Dec. 28,\\n\\n2023) (weighing a delay of approximately one year and six months\\n\\n“only slightly” in the defendant’s favor after noting that the delay,\\n\\nwhile presumptively prejudicial, “did not stretch far beyond” the\\n\\npoint of presumptive prejudice).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   25\\n           (ii)   Reason for the Delay. The trial court weighed the\\n\\nreason-for-the-delay factor in the State’s favor. Appellant contends\\n\\nthat the trial court erred in doing so, but most of his arguments\\n\\nrelate to periods that preceded the delay at issue. With respect to\\n\\nthe relevant delay – the approximately one year and seven months\\n\\nfrom the entry of the order granting him a new trial on July 7, 2021,\\n\\nto the start of his fourth trial on February 2, 2023 – he does not\\n\\nallege, and the record does not suggest, any “deliberate delay to\\n\\nhamper the defense,” which would be weighed heavily against the\\n\\nState. Vermont v. Brillon, \\n556 U.S. 81\\n, 90 (129 SCt 1283, 173 LE2d\\n\\n231) (2009) (cleaned up). To the contrary, the trial court expressly\\n\\nfound that the prosecutors worked diligently to bring the case to\\n\\ntrial during the relevant period, and the record fully supports that\\n\\nfinding. Instead, Appellant argues merely that the trial court abused\\n\\nits discretion in failing to weigh the reason-for-the-delay factor\\n\\n“marginally” against the State. We see no abuse of discretion.\\n\\n     The trial court pointed to two reasons for the delay from July\\n\\n7, 2021, to February 2, 2023: (1) the filing of “numerous Defense\\n\\n                                 26\\n motions” by Appellant; and (2) the recusal of two judges to whom the\\n\\ncase was assigned. 2 The trial court found the periods of judicial\\n\\nreassignment to be “neutral,” essentially concluding that neither\\n\\nAppellant nor the State was more to blame for them. The trial court\\n\\nthen found that, on balance, the delay was beyond the State’s control\\n\\nand exercised its discretion to weigh the reason-for-the-delay factor\\n\\nin the State’s favor.\\n\\n      The record supports the trial court’s finding that, as between\\n\\nAppellant and the State, Appellant was more to blame for the\\n\\nrelevant delay. Appellant does not contend that the trial court erred\\n\\nin weighing the periods of judicial reassignment neutrally. As for the\\n\\n“numerous Defense motions,” Appellant filed more than three dozen\\n\\npretrial motions between July 7, 2021, and February 2, 2023, which\\n\\ntook multiple hearings and months to resolve. See \\nid.\\n (“Delay caused\\n\\nby the defense weighs against the defendant . . . .” (cleaned up));\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 The first of the two judges voluntarily recused himself in response to a\\n\\nmotion to recuse filed by Appellant. The second judge explained that she\\nrecused herself in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety after Appellant\\nsubpoenaed the chief judge of her judicial circuit to testify at a hearing.\\n                                      27\\n Doggett, \\n505 U.S. at 656\\n (explaining that “pretrial delay is often both\\n\\ninevitable and wholly justifiable,” that “the government may need\\n\\ntime to,” among other things, “oppose [the defendant’s] pretrial\\n\\nmotions,” and that “we attach great weight to such considerations”\\n\\n(cleaned up)). See also Jenkins, \\n294 Ga. at 512\\n (“While defense\\n\\ncounsel felt the responsibility to file and pursue the motions and\\n\\npleas, it did not alter the fact that the case would have been brought\\n\\nto trial but for the need to hear and rule on them.” (cleaned up)). In\\n\\nlight of the numerous pretrial motions filed by Appellant, as well as\\n\\nthe trial court’s express finding of prosecutorial diligence in bringing\\n\\nthe case to trial following the grant of a new trial, we hold that the\\n\\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the reason-for-\\n\\nthe-delay factor in the State’s favor (and thus against Appellant).\\n\\n           (iii) Assertion of the Right. Appellant filed a Demand for\\n\\nSpeedy Trial on July 15, 2021, eight days after the entry of the order\\n\\ngranting him a new trial. The trial court found that since that time,\\n\\nAppellant “consistently asserted his right to a speedy trial.” The\\n\\ntrial court therefore exercised its discretion to weigh the assertion-\\n\\n                                  28\\n of-the-right factor in Appellant’s favor (and thus against the State).\\n\\nAppellant does not argue that the trial court abused its discretion in\\n\\nweighing this factor in his favor, and we see no abuse of discretion.\\n\\n          (iv) Prejudice to the Defendant from the Delay. In the\\n\\nspeedy trial context, the United States Supreme Court has identified\\n\\nthree types of prejudice that are relevant: (1) oppressive pretrial\\n\\nincarceration; (2) anxiety and concern resulting from public\\n\\naccusation; and (3) impairment of the accused’s ability to defend\\n\\nagainst the charges due to dimming memories and loss of\\n\\nexculpatory evidence. See Betterman, 578 U.S. at 442; Doggett, \\n505\\n\\nU.S. at 654\\n. The trial court found that Appellant failed to show that\\n\\nhe suffered any such prejudice in the approximately one year and\\n\\nseven months from the entry of the order granting him a new trial\\n\\non July 7, 2021, to the start of his fourth trial on February 2, 2023,\\n\\nand therefore exercised its discretion to weigh the prejudice-to-the-\\n\\ndefendant factor against Appellant.\\n\\n     Appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding that he\\n\\nfailed to show prejudice, but again, most of his arguments relate to\\n\\n                                 29\\n periods of time that preceded the relevant delay. For example, he\\n\\npoints to his years on death row living under the threat of execution\\n\\nin an attempt to show that he suffered oppressive pretrial\\n\\nincarceration, circumstances that no longer existed after he was\\n\\ngranted a new trial on July 7, 2021. And as evidence of his anxiety\\n\\nand concern resulting from public accusation, he points to his pro se\\n\\nfilings during periods of time that preceded the grant of a new trial.\\n\\n     Appellant’s claims of impairment to his defense likewise relate\\n\\nprimarily to periods of time before July 7, 2021. For example, he\\n\\nargues that the delay deprived him of the opportunity to elicit\\n\\ntestimony from his niece, Theresa Wilson, about statements that\\n\\nBrenda Smith allegedly made in 1995, because Wilson had died by\\n\\nthe time of his fourth trial. But Wilson died on August 10, 2020,\\n\\napproximately 11 months before the grant of a new trial on July 7,\\n\\n2021, so any prejudice to the defense from her unavailability cannot\\n\\nproperly be attributed to the relevant delay. See Higgenbottom v.\\n\\nState, \\n290 Ga. 198\\n, 203 (\\n719 SE2d 482\\n) (2011) (holding that the\\n\\ndeath of a witness did not constitute prejudice to the defendant\\n\\n                                 30\\n where the witness died “prior to the attachment of his constitutional\\n\\nrights to a speedy trial”).\\n\\n     Appellant also points to memory loss by a number of witnesses\\n\\ndue to the passage of time between the murders in 1995 and his\\n\\nfourth trial in 2023. However, the trial court found that Appellant\\n\\nfailed to show prejudice from the dimming of memories, because the\\n\\nwitnesses had testified under oath and been subject to cross-\\n\\nexamination at Appellant’s first three trials, and the transcripts\\n\\nfrom the prior trials had crystallized their memories and provided a\\n\\nsource of testimony from witnesses who were no longer available.\\n\\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Appellant\\n\\nfailed to show prejudice in this regard. See Jakupovic, \\n287 Ga. at\\n\\n207-208\\n (holding, in the context of a retrial, that the trial court did\\n\\nnot abuse its discretion in finding that the defendant failed to show\\n\\nprejudice from the unavailability of two witnesses where transcripts\\n\\nof their testimony from his first trial were available).\\n\\n     Appellant argues as well that his defense was impaired by the\\n\\ninability of Pam Wilson and Alvin Brown to remember certain\\n\\n                                  31\\n events from 1995 by the time of his fourth trial in 2023. At a hearing\\n\\non April 22, 2022, Wilson denied having told Agent Williamson in\\n\\n1995 that she saw Brenda Smith and her sister take something out\\n\\nof Appellant’s car on the day of the murders. But the jury at\\n\\nAppellant’s fourth trial was aware of Wilson’s alleged statement,\\n\\nbecause Appellant asked Agent Williamson about it on cross-\\n\\nexamination. Thus, Appellant has not shown prejudice to his\\n\\ndefense from Wilson’s lack of memory.\\n\\n     As for Brown, according to a Burke County Sheriff’s Office\\n\\nincident report dated July 18, 1995, Frederico beat Alvin Brown\\n\\nwith a board at a club in Gough, leaving Brown with cuts and\\n\\nscrapes around his right shoulder. At a hearing on November 17,\\n\\n2022, Brown testified that he had no recollection of the incident,\\n\\nalthough he did not deny that it happened. Appellant argues that\\n\\nhis defense was impaired, because Brown’s memory loss left him\\n\\nunable to establish acts of violence by Frederico in the same year as\\n\\nthe murders. But the jury at Appellant’s fourth trial knew that\\n\\nFrederico had pled guilty to two counts of felony murder in\\n\\n                                 32\\n connection with the deaths of Brenda Palmer and Christine.\\n\\nAppellant therefore failed to show prejudice from Brown’s lack of\\n\\nmemory.\\n\\n     Finally, Appellant argues that at some point after his third\\n\\ntrial in 2007, the State lost or destroyed potential biological evidence\\n\\nfrom the crime scene, which impaired his defense at his fourth trial.\\n\\nSpecifically, he claims that his defense was impaired by his inability\\n\\nto perform independent testing on the two gauze pads that Agent\\n\\nLeonard used to wipe the skin between Christine’s legs where a\\n\\nmilky white liquid had pooled and then dissipated. However, the\\n\\ntrial court expressly found that the gauze pads were not exculpatory,\\n\\nbecause the GBI performed serological testing on them in 1995, and\\n\\nthe results were negative for the presence of semen. The trial court\\n\\nalso noted that Appellant did not seek to independently test the\\n\\ngauze pads during his first three trials, when they were still\\n\\navailable for testing. Appellant has not shown that the trial court’s\\n\\nfinding that the potential biological evidence lacked exculpatory\\n\\nvalue is clearly erroneous.\\n\\n                                  33\\n      In sum, the record supports the trial court’s finding that\\n\\nAppellant failed to show that he suffered any relevant prejudice\\n\\nfrom this delay at issue. The trial court therefore did not abuse its\\n\\ndiscretion in weighing this factor against Appellant.\\n\\n           (v)   Conclusion. The trial court weighed the assertion-of-\\n\\nthe-right factor against the State and the length-of-the-delay factor\\n\\nslightly against the State but weighed the reason-for-the-delay\\n\\nfactor and the prejudice-to-the-defendant factor against Appellant.\\n\\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in the weights it assigned\\n\\nto these factors or in concluding, on balance, that the scales tipped\\n\\nagainst Appellant. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\\n\\nrejecting Appellant’s speedy trial claim.\\n\\n     3.    Appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\nmotion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his due process\\n\\nrights were violated by the State’s loss or destruction of the potential\\n\\nbiological evidence discussed above. Alternatively, he claims that\\n\\nthe trial court erred in denying his request to instruct the jury that\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  34\\n it could draw an adverse inference against the State from the loss or\\n\\ndestruction of the evidence. Both claims fail.\\n\\n       “When the State suppresses or fails to disclose material\\n\\nexculpatory evidence, the good or bad faith of the prosecution is\\n\\nirrelevant: a due process violation occurs whenever such evidence is\\n\\nwithheld.” Illinois v. Fisher, \\n540 U.S. 544\\n, 547 (124 SCt 1200, 157\\n\\nLE2d 1060) (2004) (cleaned up). However, due process “‘requires a\\n\\ndifferent result when we deal with the failure of the State to\\n\\npreserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than\\n\\nthat it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might\\n\\nhave    exonerated   the   defendant.’”   \\nId.\\n    (quoting   Arizona   v.\\n\\nYoungblood, \\n488 U.S. 51\\n, 57 (109 SCt 333, 102 LE2d 281) (1988)).\\n\\nThe State’s “failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not\\n\\nconstitute a denial of due process of law” unless the defendant can\\n\\nshow “bad faith” on the part of the State in the failure to preserve\\n\\nthe evidence. Youngblood, \\n488 U.S. at 58\\n. The applicability of the\\n\\nbad-faith requirement does not depend on “the centrality of the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 35\\n contested evidence to the prosecution’s case or the defendant’s\\n\\ndefense.” Fisher, \\n540 U.S. at 549\\n.\\n\\n     The trial court determined that the potential biological\\n\\nevidence in this case had no apparent exculpatory value at the time\\n\\nthat it was lost or destroyed. To the contrary, serological testing of\\n\\nthe gauze pads was negative for the presence of semen. At best, the\\n\\ngauze pads were “potentially useful evidence” for the defense.\\n\\nYoungblood, \\n488 U.S. at 58\\n. See also Fisher, \\n540 U.S. at 547-549\\n\\n\\n(distinguishing   “material    exculpatory    evidence”    from   mere\\n\\n“potentially useful evidence” (cleaned up)). The trial court found that\\n\\n“nothing in the record indicates that the State acted in bad faith in\\n\\nfailing to preserve” the potential biological evidence, and our review\\n\\nof the record confirms the trial court’s finding in this regard. Thus,\\n\\nAppellant’s due process rights were not violated, and the trial court\\n\\ndid not err in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment based on\\n\\nan alleged due process violation.\\n\\n     Appellant also claims that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\noral request to instruct the jury that it could infer from the fact that\\n\\n                                    36\\n the State lost or destroyed the potential biological evidence that the\\n\\nresults of laboratory analysis would have been favorable to the\\n\\ndefense. However, there is no legal basis in Georgia law for giving a\\n\\nspoliation, or adverse inference, jury instruction in a criminal case.\\n\\nTo the contrary, we have held that it is inappropriate to give a\\n\\nspoliation instruction in a criminal case, see Howard v. State, \\n307\\n\\nGa. 12\\n, 18-19 & n.9 (\\n834 SE2d 11\\n) (2019), disapproved on other\\n\\ngrounds by Johnson v. State, \\n315 Ga. 876\\n, 889 n.11 (\\n885 SE2d 725\\n)\\n\\n(2023), even when the instruction is requested by the defendant, see\\n\\nRadford v. State, \\n251 Ga. 50\\n, 53 (\\n302 SE2d 555\\n) (1983). Accordingly,\\n\\nthe trial court did not err in refusing to give Appellant’s requested\\n\\njury instruction.3\\n\\n     4.    Appellant asserts that the trial court violated his\\n\\nconstitutional right to present a defense by excluding evidence of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 Howard and Radford relied on former OCGA § 24-4-22. However, that\\n\\nprovision was carried forward substantially unchanged into Georgia’s current\\nEvidence Code as OCGA § 24-14-22, and it has no counterpart in the Federal\\nRules of Evidence. Accordingly, “our case law interpreting that former\\nprovision applies.” State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 557 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018).\\n                                    37\\n “historical bias against him on the part of local law enforcement and\\n\\nprosecutors.” This claim fails.\\n\\n     Appellant’s claim is based on the trial court’s pretrial rulings\\n\\nprecluding him from introducing three categories of evidence:\\n\\n(1) evidence that the State violated his Brady rights at his first three\\n\\ntrials by failing to disclose evidence favorable to the defense;\\n\\n(2) evidence that he filed a federal civil rights complaint against a\\n\\ndeputy in the Burke County Sheriff’s Office in 1978; and (3) evidence\\n\\nthat the accusations against him in 1995 were used in a successful\\n\\ncampaign to keep a superior court judge who was appointed shortly\\n\\nbefore the murders from being elected to a full term the following\\n\\nyear. 4 Appellant does not contend that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in excluding this evidence under the Georgia Evidence\\n\\nCode. See OCGA §§ 24-4-402 (relevant evidence generally is\\n\\nadmissible; irrelevant evidence is inadmissible), 24-4-403 (relevant\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 Appellant also refers in passing to the trial court’s denial of his request\\n\\nto instruct the jury that it could draw an adverse inference against the State\\nfrom the loss or destruction of the potential biological evidence. Appellant’s\\njury instruction request is discussed in Division 3 above.\\n                                      38\\n evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\\n\\noutweighed by, among other things, the danger of unfair prejudice,\\n\\nconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury or considerations of\\n\\nundue delay or waste of time). Instead, he contends that the\\n\\nexclusion of the evidence pursuant to the Georgia Evidence Code\\n\\nviolated his federal constitutional right to present a defense, citing\\n\\nState v. Burns, \\n306 Ga. 117\\n, 121 (\\n829 SE2d 367\\n) (2019) (“The Due\\n\\nProcess Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment . . . guarantees\\n\\ncriminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete\\n\\ndefense.” (cleaned up)).\\n\\n     The    United    States   Constitution   guarantees     criminal\\n\\ndefendants the “right to present a defense.” United States v.\\n\\nScheffer, \\n523 U.S. 303\\n, 315 (118 SCt 1261, 140 LE2d 413) (1998)\\n\\n(cleaned up). However, “state and federal rulemakers have broad\\n\\nlatitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence\\n\\nfrom criminal trials.” Nevada v. Jackson, \\n569 U.S. 505\\n, 509 (133 SCt\\n\\n1990, 186 LE2d 62) (2013) (cleaned up). The routine application of\\n\\nwell-established rules of evidence like OCGA §§ 24-4-402 and 24-4-\\n\\n                                 39\\n 403 to exclude irrelevant evidence, or relevant evidence whose\\n\\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by factors such as the\\n\\ndanger unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or the potential to\\n\\nmislead the jury, does not violate a defendant’s constitutional right\\n\\nto present a defense. See Holmes v. South Carolina, \\n547 U.S. 319\\n,\\n\\n326-327 (126 SCt 1727, 164 LE2d 503) (2006) (noting that such rules\\n\\nare “familiar and unquestionably constitutional,” and stating that\\n\\n“the Constitution permits judges to exclude evidence that is\\n\\nrepetitive, only marginally relevant[,] or poses an undue risk of\\n\\nharassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues” (cleaned up)). The\\n\\nconstitutional right to present a defense is abridged only “by\\n\\nevidence rules that infringe upon a weighty interest of the accused\\n\\nand are arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are\\n\\ndesigned to serve.” \\nId. at 324\\n (cleaned up). See also \\nid. at 326\\n\\n\\n(explaining that “the Constitution . . . prohibits the exclusion of\\n\\ndefense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or\\n\\nthat are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to\\n\\npromote”). “Only rarely” has the United States Supreme Court held\\n\\n                                 40\\n that the “right to present a complete defense was violated by the\\n\\nexclusion of defense evidence under a state rule of evidence.”\\n\\nJackson, \\n569 U.S. at 509\\n.\\n\\n     Appellant does not argue that OCGA §§ 24-4-402 and 24-4-403\\n\\nare “arbitrary” or “disproportionate to the purposes they are\\n\\ndesigned to serve,” and he has made no such showing here.\\n\\nMoreover, this case bears no resemblance to cases in which the\\n\\nUnited States Supreme Court has held that the exclusion of\\n\\nevidence pursuant to state evidentiary rules violated a defendant’s\\n\\nconstitutional right to present a defense. Cf., e.g., Rock v. Arkansas,\\n\\n483 U.S. 44\\n, 57-62 (107 SCt 2704, 97 LE2d 37) (1987) (holding that\\n\\nan evidentiary rule excluding all hypnotically refreshed testimony\\n\\nviolated the defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense\\n\\nwhere it prevented the defendant, who was accused of a killing to\\n\\nwhich she was the sole eyewitness, from testifying in her own\\n\\ndefense); Chambers v. Mississippi, \\n410 U.S. 284\\n, 294-302 (93 SCt\\n\\n1038, 35 LE2d 297) (1973) (holding that the denial of a murder\\n\\ndefendant’s motion to treat as an adverse witness a man who had\\n\\n                                  41\\n confessed to the charged murder but later retracted the confession,\\n\\ncombined with the exclusion of the testimony of three witnesses to\\n\\nwhom the man had confessed on hearsay grounds, violated the\\n\\ndefendant’s constitutional right to present a defense); Washington v.\\n\\nTexas, \\n388 U.S. 14\\n, 19-23 (87 SCt 1920, 18 LE2d 1019) (1967)\\n\\n(holding that a murder defendant’s constitutional right to present a\\n\\ndefense was violated when he was prevented from calling as a\\n\\nwitness a man who had been convicted of the same murder based on\\n\\ntwo evidentiary statutes preventing persons charged or convicted as\\n\\nparticipants in committing the same crime from testifying for one\\n\\nanother). Furthermore, Appellant does not cite, and we have not\\n\\nfound, a case from any court holding that the exclusion of evidence\\n\\nalleged to show “historical bias” against a defendant “on the part of\\n\\nlocal law enforcement and prosecutors” under standard rules of\\n\\nevidence violates the defendant’s constitutional right to present a\\n\\ndefense.\\n\\n     Evidence relating to the State’s prior Brady violations,\\n\\nAppellant’s civil rights complaint from the late 1970s, and a 1996\\n\\n                                 42\\n judicial election was at best tangential to the issues at Appellant’s\\n\\nfourth trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\\n\\nin   excluding   this   evidence,   much     less   violate   Appellant’s\\n\\nconstitutional right to present a defense.\\n\\n     5.   Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\\n\\nprohibiting him from questioning Agent Williamson about a drug-\\n\\nrelated shooting two months after the murders in which a man\\n\\nnamed Ricardo Chandler shot and killed Appellant’s teenage son\\n\\nWilbur. Wilbur was arguing with a woman who said that since he\\n\\nwas selling drugs in her front yard, he should be sharing the profits\\n\\nwith her. When Chandler intervened in the argument, Wilbur pulled\\n\\nout a gun and started shooting at him, and Chandler then shot and\\n\\nkilled Wilbur in self-defense. According to Appellant, the prohibited\\n\\nquestioning would have allowed him to show that Wilbur was the\\n\\nperson who committed the murders with Frederico, not Appellant,\\n\\nand that the investigators unfairly focused on Appellant to the\\n\\nexclusion of other possible suspects.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    43\\n           Certainly a defendant is entitled to introduce\\n     relevant and admissible testimony tending to show that\\n     another person committed the crime for which the\\n     defendant is tried. However, the proffered evidence must\\n     raise a reasonable inference of the defendant’s innocence,\\n     and must directly connect the other person with the\\n     corpus delicti, or show that the other person has recently\\n     committed a crime of the same or similar nature.\\n\\nKlinect v. State, \\n269 Ga. 570\\n, 573 (\\n501 SE2d 810\\n) (1998) (citation\\n\\nomitted). See also OCGA § 24-4-403 (permitting trial courts to\\n\\nexclude even relevant evidence “if its probative value is\\n\\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\\n\\nconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury”);\\nHolmes, 547\\n U.S. at\\n\\n327 & n.*, 330 (citing Klinect and explaining that rules like the one\\n\\nadopted in Klinect “are widely accepted” and are “designed . . . to\\n\\nfocus the trial on the central issues by excluding evidence that has\\n\\nonly a very weak logical connection to the central issues”); Moss v.\\n\\nState, \\n298 Ga. 613\\n, 616-617 & n.4 (\\n783 SE2d 652\\n) (2016) (applying\\n\\nKlinect’s rule regarding the admissibility of third-party guilt\\n\\nevidence in a case decided under Georgia’s current Evidence Code\\n\\nbased on OCGA § 24-4-403). Third-party guilt evidence “that merely\\n\\n\\n                                 44\\n casts a bare suspicion on another or raises a conjectural inference as\\n\\nto the commission of the crime by another is not admissible.” Roberts\\n\\nv. State, \\n305 Ga. 257\\n, 261 (\\n824 SE2d 326\\n) (2019) (cleaned up). See\\n\\nalso Moss, \\n298 Ga. at 616\\n (holding that the trial court did not abuse\\n\\nits discretion in preventing the defendant from questioning two\\n\\nwitnesses about a prior shooting of the victim to show that there\\n\\nwere other potential suspects in the victim’s murder, because the\\n\\ncourt was not required to allow the defendant to introduce evidence\\n\\n“based purely on rumor, speculation, and conjecture” (cleaned up)).\\n\\n     The testimony that Appellant sought to elicit from Agent\\n\\nWilliamson would not have raised a reasonable inference of\\n\\nAppellant’s innocence. At most, it would have cast “bare suspicion”\\n\\non Wilbur or raised a “conjectural inference” that he was somehow\\n\\ninvolved in the murders with Appellant and Frederico. Roberts, \\n305\\n\\nGa. at 261\\n (cleaned up). It also would not have shown that Agent\\n\\nWilliamson unfairly focused on Appellant to the exclusion of a viable\\n\\nalternate suspect, as there was no evidence of animus on the part of\\n\\nWilbur towards Brenda Palmer or Christine and no evidence that\\n\\n                                 45\\n Wilbur had the opportunity to commit the murders, either alone or\\n\\nwith Appellant and Frederico. Nothing linked Wilbur to the\\n\\nmurders. See Roberts, \\n305 Ga. at 261\\n (“Even if opportunity could be\\n\\ninferred, nothing linked this third party to the murder.” (cleaned\\n\\nup)). To the extent that Appellant was attempting to show Wilbur’s\\n\\nparticipation in the murders based solely on the fact that he had\\n\\n“recently committed a crime of the same or similar nature,” Klinect,\\n\\n269 Ga. at 573\\n, the testimony that he sought to elicit was\\n\\ninadmissible character evidence. See OCGA § 24-4-404 (b)\\n\\n(“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts shall not be admissible\\n\\nto prove the character of a person in order to show action in\\n\\nconformity therewith. . . .”). Accordingly, the trial court did not\\n\\nabuse its discretion in precluding Appellant from questioning Agent\\n\\nWilliamson about the drug-related shooting with no apparent\\n\\nconnection to this case that resulted in Wilbur’s death two months\\n\\nafter the murders.\\n\\n     6.   Finally, Appellant claims that the cumulative effect of the\\n\\ntrial court’s errors deprived him of a fundamentally fair trial. See\\n\\n                                 46\\n State v.

Kiker, Sr., and two other taxpayers filed their petition in Gilmer County against the sheriff and other county officials seeking, besides other relief, to prevent the collection form the plaintiffs of property taxes for 1966 over and above the amounts shown to be due by their 1966 tax returns. The plaintiffs contended in substance as follows: that the members of the Board of Tax Assessors were not legally appointed; that the tax receiver in taking 1966 tax returns did not administer an oath and did not furnish a list of questions to any taxpayer as required by law; that the $2,000 homestead exemption was applied against 40% of the actual value of real estate of taxpayers rather than against 100% of actual value as required; and that in stated particulars the tax officials improperly valued real and personal property throughout the county.\\nUpon the interlocutory hearing the trial court found against these contentions. Its judgment denying the injunction recited, among other matters, that the evidence showed that the 1966 tax digest for that county had been approved by the State Revenue Commissioner on December 20, 1966, that 96% of such 1966 taxes had been paid, and that 93.2% of all taxpayers of the county had paid their 1966 taxes.\\nThis feature alone, as we appraise the numerous issues presented, is decisive. The plaintiffs' contentions involve not only their own taxes but the entire 1966 tax digest of the county. They did not file their suit until long after the State Revenue Commissioner had approved that digest pursuant to Code Ann. § 92-6917 (see Youmans v. Hamilton, 218 Ga. 402 (128 SE2d 151)), and after a vast majority of other taxpayers had voluntarily paid their 1966 taxes and hence could not recover them. See Mayor &c. of Savannah v. Fawcett, 186 Ga. 132, 138 (197 SE 253). Under these circumstances the plaintiffs are guilty of laches and are not entitled to the relief they seek. Code § 55-108; 84 CJS 1163, Taxation, § 582(d).

CABRERA-ZAMARRIPA v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      BARNES, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      Following a jury trial, Stewart Alonzo Cabrera-Zamarripa (“Cabrera”) was\\n\\nconvicted of armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony, and other offenses arising out of the theft of a pair of limited edition sneakers.\\n\\nArguing that he is entitled to new trial, Cabrera contends that the trial court erred by\\n\\nadmitting into evidence a stipulation without first determining that he knowingly and\\n\\nvoluntarily waived his constitutional rights as to the stipulated facts and evidence.\\n\\nCabrera further maintains that the trial court gave erroneous jury instructions on the\\n\\nlaw of factual stipulations and on possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\\n       Construed in the light most favorable to the verdict,1 the evidence showed that\\n\\nGustavo Campa, a high school student, sold pairs of limited edition sneakers, and he\\n\\narranged through a social media app to sell a pair of Yeezy 350 Breds to a buyer later\\n\\nidentified as Cabrera. On the afternoon of July 13, 2019, Campa had his friend, Myles\\n\\nMoon, drive him to a Kroger parking lot in Gwinnett County to finalize the sale.\\n\\nCampa’s friend Diandre Garrett rode with them. After they arrived at the parking lot,\\n\\nthey saw Cabrera in a parked car with his friend, Jose “Ivan” Guevara. Because it was\\n\\nraining, Campa invited Cabrera into Moon’s car to discuss the sale, and both Cabrera\\n\\nand Guevara got into the backseat. During the ensuing discussion over the shoes,\\n\\nMoon sat in the driver’s seat, Campa in the front passenger seat, Garrett in the right\\n\\nrear passenger seat, Guevara in the center rear passenger seat, and Cabrera in the left\\n\\nrear passenger seat.\\n\\n      As the discussion continued, Campa handed the shoes to Cabrera so that he\\n\\ncould inspect them. Cabrera, however, put the shoes in his book bag, announced that\\n\\nhe was taking them, and pulled out a handgun. Cabrera pointed the handgun at Campa\\n\\nand Garrett. As Cabrera exited from the car with the shoes, Garrett reached for the\\n\\n      1\\n      See Jackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U. S. 307\\n, 319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61\\nLE2d 560) (1979).\\n                                          2\\n handgun, and Cabrera fired two shots into the car. One of the shots wounded Garrett,\\n\\nand the other wounded Guevara. Cabrera and Guevara ran off, got into their car, and\\n\\nfled from the parking lot.\\n\\n      Immediately after the shooting, Moon drove Campa and Garrett to Gwinnett\\n\\nMedical Center, where Garrett was treated for his gunshot wounds. The three of them\\n\\nsubsequently were interviewed by the police at the hospital. Garrett showed an officer\\n\\nphotographs of Cabrera on social media and later identified him in a photographic\\n\\nlineup as the shooter. Moon also was shown a photographic lineup and identified\\n\\nCabrera as the shooter. Additionally, Moon consented to the search of his car, and a\\n\\ncrime scene investigator discovered a bullet projectile lodged in the back of the front\\n\\npassenger seat and a shell casing ejected from a .40 caliber firearm on the left rear\\n\\npassenger seat. Blood was visible in the rear passenger compartment of the car and on\\n\\nthe rear passenger doors.\\n\\n      The police obtained a search warrant for Cabrera’s residence. During the\\n\\nsearch, the police found a .40 caliber pistol and a handgun laser site in Cabrera’s\\n\\nbedroom, but further testing indicated that the handgun was not the one used in the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           3\\n shooting. Among other items, the police found a book bag and a collection of shoes\\n\\nand shoe boxes, but not the shoes taken from Campa.\\n\\n      Additionally, as part of their investigation, the police obtained copies of\\n\\nKroger’s security camera videos. One video showed two cars located in the area of the\\n\\nshooting incident and a person running in a white shirt, but the camera was too far\\n\\naway too confirm the makes or the models of the cars or the identity of the person\\n\\nrunning.\\n\\n      Shortly after the shooting, the police also interviewed Cabrera’s friend,\\n\\nGuevara, who sought treatment at a different hospital. Guevara initially told the police\\n\\nthat he had been shot at a county park after he went there to purchase some shoes\\n\\nfrom someone. Guevara later conceded to an investigator that the shooting occurred\\n\\nat the Kroger during a shoe deal, but he claimed that the driver of the other car was\\n\\nthe one who fired a gun.\\n\\n      Cabrera was arrested and indicted on charges of armed robbery, aggravated\\n\\nassault (two counts), theft by taking, and possession of a firearm during the\\n\\ncommission of a felony (armed robbery). At trial, Campa and Garrett testified about\\n\\nthe shoe deal as described above and identified Cabrera as the shooter. The recorded\\n\\n\\n                                           4\\n police interviews of Campa, Garrett, and Moon in which they described the shooting\\n\\nincident also were introduced into evidence and played for the jury. In addition to the\\n\\nresponding officers and investigators involved in the case, the State called the crime\\n\\nscene investigator who photographed and processed the evidence relating to Moon’s\\n\\ncar, and she opined that the locations of the bullet casing and projectile were\\n\\nconsistent with someone firing the gun while sitting in or exiting from the left rear\\n\\npassenger seat.\\n\\n      The State also called Guevara as a witness. Guevara testified about the shoe\\n\\ndeal, but he maintained that he did not see Cabrera with a gun, that he blacked out\\n\\nwhen he got shot, and that he did not know who shot him. According to Guevara, he\\n\\nremembered hearing gunshots but could no longer recall seeing anyone with a gun in\\n\\nthe car that day.\\n\\n      Additionally, a written list of stipulations signed by the prosecutor and\\n\\nCabrera’s counsel was admitted into evidence and read into the record. The\\n\\nstipulations pertained to the search of Cabrera’s residence and the items found there;\\n\\nthe security camera video obtained from Kroger; the audio and video recordings of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          5\\n police interviews of Moon, Campa, Garrett, and Guevara; an investigator’s report\\n\\nabout the case; and the photographic lineups shown to Garrett and Moon.\\n\\n      After the State rested, the defense called a firearm ballistics expert, who\\n\\ndisagreed with the crime scene investigator’s assessment of the trajectory of the\\n\\ngunfire based on the location of the projectile and shell casing found in Moon’s car.\\n\\nCabrera elected not to testify.\\n\\n      The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. Cabrera subsequently filed\\n\\na motion for new trial, as amended, which the trial court denied, except with respect\\n\\nto a sentencing issue. Cabrera filed a notice of appeal from that order, but this Court\\n\\ndismissed the appeal because Cabrera had not yet been resentenced. After the trial\\n\\ncourt resentenced Cabrera,2 his appeal was retransmitted to this Court and is now\\n\\nproperly before us for review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2\\n        In Cabrera’s original sentence, the trial court merged one count of aggravated\\nassault and the theft by taking count into the armed robbery count. In the resentencing\\norder, the trial court determined that the second aggravated assault count also should\\nbe merged into the armed robbery count. On the armed robbery count and the\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony count, Cabrera was\\nsentenced to a total of 25 years, with the first 15 years to be served in confinement and\\nthe remainder to be served on probation.\\n                                           6\\n       1. Cabrera contends that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the\\n\\nwritten list of stipulations signed by the prosecutor and defense counsel. According\\n\\nto Cabrera, by stipulating to certain facts and to the admission of certain evidence, he\\n\\nwaived his fundamental constitutional rights to trial by jury, to proof of guilt beyond\\n\\na reasonable doubt, to confront witnesses, and to due process as to those stipulations.\\n\\nCabrera maintains that the trial court should have obtained his express, personal\\n\\nwaiver of those constitutional rights with respect to the stipulations before their\\n\\nadmission at trial.\\n\\n      Cabrera’s argument is unpersuasive. We have previously rejected the argument\\n\\nthat a trial court must question a defendant as to whether he agrees to a stipulation\\n\\nauthorized by his counsel or obtain a personal waiver from a defendant of his\\n\\nconstitutional rights before admitting a stipulation at trial. See Muldrow v. State, \\n322\\n\\nGa. App. 190\\n, 194-195 (3) (\\n744 SE2d 413\\n) (2013); Littlejohn v. State, \\n320 Ga. App. 197\\n,\\n\\n204-205 (3) (\\n739 SE2d 682\\n) (2013); Martin v. State, \\n251 Ga. App. 149\\n, 149-150 (1) (\\n553\\n\\nSE2d 827\\n) (2001). Rather, a stipulation made by defense counsel and presented to the\\n\\njury in the defendant’s presence is sufficient to bind the defendant and show his\\n\\nauthorization. See Muldrow, \\n322 Ga. App. at 195\\n (3).\\n\\n\\n                                           7\\n       Generally, a statement by defense counsel made in the presence of the\\n      defendant relating to the defendant’s conduct is considered a statement\\n      by the defendant himself if the defendant does not repudiate counsel’s\\n      authority to make the statement. The general rule as to stipulations is\\n      that once made in the course of judicial proceedings an estoppel results\\n      unless the complaining party can show fraud or mistake. Such an express\\n      stipulation should generally be made in writing or in open court.\\n\\n\\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Flading v. State, \\n327 Ga. App. 346\\n, 350 (1) (\\n759\\n\\nSE2d 67\\n) (2014).\\n\\n      The written list of stipulations was agreed to by Cabrera’s counsel, admitted\\n\\ninto evidence, and read to the jury in Cabrera’s presence without objection. And\\n\\nCabrera does not claim fraud or mistake in reaching the stipulations. Under these\\n\\ncircumstances, Cabrera “acquiesced in the stipulations, and the stipulations were\\n\\nbinding upon him.” Littlejohn, \\n320 Ga. App. at 205\\n (3). See Flading , \\n327 Ga. App. at\\n\\n350-351\\n (1); Muldrow, \\n322 Ga. App. at 195\\n (3). We therefore discern no error by the\\n\\ntrial court in the admission of the stipulations.3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3\\n         The stipulations in the present case did not include any stipulations to a\\nmaterial element of an offense, such as intent. Our opinion thus does not address\\nstipulations that could be construed as in the nature of a plea of guilt.\\n                                            8\\n       2. Cabrera also contends that the trial court gave an erroneous jury instruction\\n\\non the law of factual stipulations. The trial court instructed the jury:\\n\\n             It is your responsibility to determine the facts of this case from all\\n      of the evidence presented. Then you must apply the law I give you in this\\n      charge to the facts as [you] find them to be.\\n\\n\\n             Your oath requires that you will decide this case based on the\\n      evidence. Evidence is the means by which any fact that is put in issue is\\n      established or disproved. Evidence includes all of the testimony of the\\n      witnesses and any exhibits admitted during the trial and stipulations of\\n      the attorneys; that is, any facts to which the attorneys have agreed with\\n      approval by the Court. Evidence does not include the indictment, the\\n      plea of not guilty, opening or closing remarks of the attorneys, or\\n      questions asked by the attorneys.\\n\\n\\n             The parties have entered into stipulations that have been approved\\n      by the Court about facts, testimony, documents, and exhibits. The\\n      specific stipulations of the parties, with all of the details, have been\\n      previously read to you and admitted into evidence for your consideration\\n      as State’s Exhibit 7.\\n\\n\\n             Where parties stipulate facts, that is in the nature of evidence, and you\\n      must take that fact or those facts as a given without the necessity of further\\n      proof. You make all decisions based on the evidence in this case.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             9\\n              Where parties stipulate testimony, documents, and exhibits, this\\n      is also in the nature of evidence. You may take that testimony as if it were\\n      given in court, and you may rely on it if you find it credible. However,\\n      either party may dispute such testimony by other evidence. Again, you\\n      make all decisions based on the evidence in this case.\\n\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) According to Cabrera, the italicized portion of the instruction\\n\\nwas improper because it prohibited the jury from finding a fact inconsistent with any\\n\\nfactual stipulation.\\n\\n      Because Cabrera did not object to the jury instruction when it was given, we\\n\\nreview the instruction only for plain error. OCGA § 17-8-58 (b); Grullon v. State, \\n313\\n\\nGa. 40\\n, 44-45 (2) (\\n867 SE2d 95\\n) (2021).\\n\\n      The four prongs of the plain error analysis are set out in State v. Kelly,\\n      290 Ga. 29\\n, 33 (2) (a) (\\n718 SE2d 232\\n) (2011), as follows: First, there\\n      must be an error or defect – some sort of deviation from a legal rule –\\n      that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned, i.e.,\\n      affirmatively waived, by the appellant. Second, the legal error must be\\n      clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. Third, the\\n      error must have affected the appellant’s substantial rights, which in the\\n      ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it affected the outcome\\n      of the trial court proceedings. Fourth and finally, if the above three\\n      prongs are satisfied, the appellate court has the discretion to remedy the\\n      error – discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error seriously\\n\\n                                          10\\n       affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\\n      The Court need not analyze all of the elements of the plain error test\\n      when the appellant fails to establish one of them.\\n\\n\\n(Citations, punctuation, and emphasis omitted.) Simmons v. State, \\n314 Ga. 883\\n, 889\\n\\n(2) (\\n880 SE2d 125\\n) (2022).\\n\\n      Applying this test, we conclude that Cabrera has failed to establish plain error\\n\\nbecause he has not shown that the trial court’s instruction on factual stipulations\\n\\nconstituted legal error that was clear or obvious. The italicized language challenged\\n\\nby Cabrera came directly from Georgia’s pattern jury instructions in effect at the time\\n\\nof trial, and Cabrera has not pointed to any controlling authority that the pattern\\n\\ninstruction is improper. See Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II:\\n\\nCriminal Cases § 1.30.12. Moreover, it is well-established that a factual stipulation\\n\\n“obviate[s] the need for proof,” Jenkins v. State, \\n313 Ga. 81\\n, 87 (2) (\\n868 SE2d 205\\n)\\n\\n(2022) (citation and punctuation omitted), and it results in an estoppel and\\n\\n“amount[s] to a conclusively binding admission in judicio.” (Citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted.) Flading, \\n327 Ga. App. at 350\\n (1). Accordingly, Cabrera has not\\n\\nshown that the trial court’s giving of the charge on factual stipulations was clearly or\\n\\nobviously erroneous, and he thus cannot satisfy the second prong of the plain error\\n\\n                                           11\\n test. See DeMuro v. State, \\n317 Ga. 155\\n, 168 (3) (\\n892 SE2d 31\\n) (2023) (“[T]he [jury]\\n\\ninstructions were not erroneous in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute\\n\\nor court rule or in view of controlling precedent. In the absence of controlling\\n\\nauthority establishing that any error in the jury instructions at issue was obvious\\n\\nbeyond reasonable dispute, the appellant could not meet the second prong of the\\n\\nplain-error test.”); Simmons, 314 Ga. at 889-890 (2) (a) (holding that defendant failed\\n\\nto show clear and obvious error in jury instruction, where the instruction appeared in\\n\\nGeorgia’s pattern jury instructions, and the defendant did not point to any authority\\n\\nshowing that the pattern instruction was deficient); Williams v. State, \\n304 Ga. 455\\n,\\n\\n458-459 (3) (\\n818 SE2d 653\\n) (2018) (concluding that defendant failed to show that\\n\\ngiving of jury instruction that was “substantially identical to the suggested pattern jury\\n\\ninstruction” constituted clear and obvious error); Williams v. State, \\n297 Ga. 460\\n, 465\\n\\n(3) (\\n773 SE2d 213\\n) (2015) (holding that defendant failed to show that giving of jury\\n\\ninstruction drawn from Georgia’s pattern jury instructions were clear and obvious\\n\\nerror). See also Muse v. State, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n, 667 (9) (b) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023) (“As to\\n\\nthe second part of the plain error test, an error is plain if it is clear or obvious under\\n\\ncurrent law. An error cannot be plain where there is no controlling authority on point\\n\\n\\n                                           12\\n or if a defendant’s theory requires the extension of precedent.”) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n      3. Lastly, Cabrera argues that the trial court gave an erroneous jury instruction\\n\\non possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. That offense is defined\\n\\nin OCGA § 16-11-106, which provides in relevant part that “[a]ny person who shall\\n\\nhave on or within arm’s reach of his or her person a firearm . . . during the commission\\n\\nof . . . [a]ny crime against or involving the person of another . . . and which crime is a\\n\\nfelony, commits a felony[.]” OCGA § 16-11-106 (b) (1). Here, as part of its jury\\n\\ninstruction on the firearm possession offense, the trial court instructed the jury that\\n\\n“armed robbery, as alleged in this indictment, is a crime against or involving the\\n\\nperson of another and is a felony offense.” According to Cabrera, whether the\\n\\npredicate felony offense “involv[es] the person of another” is an essential element of\\n\\nthe firearm possession offense and is a fact-specific question that must be decided by\\n\\nthe jury in cases where the predicate offense is armed robbery, such that the trial\\n\\ncourt’s instruction, which removed that question from the jury’s consideration, was\\n\\nerroneous.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            13\\n       While Cabrera objected to the jury instruction during the charge conference,\\n\\nhe did not object to the instruction at the time that it was given. Our review is\\n\\ntherefore limited to determining whether plain error occurred. OCGA § 17-8-58 (b);\\n\\nGrullon, 313 Ga. at 44-45 (2). And, as previously noted, plain error requires a showing\\n\\nthat the jury instruction constituted legal error that was clear or obvious. See Simmons,\\n\\n314 Ga. at 889 (2). No such showing has been made here.\\n\\n      Cabrera has not pointed to any controlling precedent addressing the specific\\n\\nissue presented here. However, in Tucker v. State , \\n362 Ga. App. 489\\n, 505-506 (7) (\\n869\\n\\nSE2d 142\\n) (2022), we addressed the meaning of the phrase “crime . . . involving the\\n\\nperson of another” in the firearm possession statute, where the predicate felony\\n\\noffense was conspiracy to commit armed robbery. We concluded that the offense of\\n\\n“conspiracy to commit an armed robbery necessarily ‘involv[es] the person of another’\\n\\nin two ways, insofar as it requires at least one co-conspirator and at least one victim.”\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) Id. at 505 (7).\\n\\n      What we concluded was true for the crime of conspiracy to commit armed\\n\\nrobbery is also true for the crime of armed robbery itself. Armed robbery necessarily\\n\\n“involv[es] the person of another” because every armed robbery requires at least one\\n\\n\\n                                           14\\n other person as part of its commission. See OCGA § 16-8-41 (a) (“A person commits\\n\\nthe offense of armed robbery when, with intent to commit theft, he or she takes\\n\\nproperty of another from the person or the immediate presence of another by use of\\n\\nan offensive weapon[.]”); Dowdell v. State, \\n278 Ga. App. 142\\n, 144 (1) (\\n628 SE2d 226\\n)\\n\\n(2006) (explaining that “armed robbery is . . . theft from a person” and is a “crime\\n\\nagainst or involving the person of another” under the statute for possession of a\\n\\nfirearm during the commission of a felony). Because armed robbery is per se a crime\\n\\ninvolving another person, the jury need not make a finding on that issue; the trial court\\n\\ntherefore did not plainly err by instructing the jury that the crime of armed robbery is\\n\\na “crime . . . involving the person of another” for purposes of the statute prohibiting\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.

SINKFIELD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        BOGGS, Chief Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Remond Sinkfield challenges his convictions for\\n\\nfelony murder and other crimes in connection with the death of Levi\\n\\nAtkinson, who either was pushed or jumped out of a moving vehicle\\n\\nafter an altercation with Appellant, was struck by another car, and\\n\\ndied from his injuries five days later. Appellant contends that the\\n\\nevidence was insufficient to support his convictions for felony\\n\\nmurder and theft by taking; that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\nmotion to suppress a pretrial interview by police; that the trial court\\n\\ncommitted plain error in several ways; and that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion in various evidentiary rulings. He also\\n\\ncontends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel due to\\n\\nhis trial counsel’s deficiencies, including by failing to retain a\\n medical expert to testify as to the cause of Atkinson’s death. For the\\n\\nreasons that follow, we affirm.1\\n\\n      1.    The evidence presented at trial showed the following. 2\\n\\nAppellant and Atkinson were acquaintances, and Appellant\\n\\nsupplied Atkinson with drugs and prostitutes. Atkinson owned a\\n\\nbusiness and was generous with his money, occasionally paying\\n\\nbills, such as for rent and cell phone service, for Appellant and\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 The crimes occurred on January 24, 2012. It appears that Appellant\\n\\nwas first indicted in 2012, but the record does not contain that indictment. On\\nOctober 14, 2014, a Fulton County grand jury re-indicted Appellant for felony\\nmurder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault with intent to rob,\\ntheft by taking (auto), and giving false information to a law enforcement\\nofficer. At a trial from October 20-24, 2014, the jury acquitted Appellant of\\ninvoluntary manslaughter and convicted him on all other counts. The trial\\ncourt sentenced Appellant to life in prison with the possibility of parole for\\nfelony murder, a ten-year consecutive sentence for theft by taking, and a\\ntwelve-month consecutive sentence for giving false information. The\\naggravated assault count merged into the felony murder conviction. Appellant\\nfiled a premature motion for new trial, and that motion ripened upon the entry\\nof the final judgment on October 28, 2014. See Southall v. State, \\n300 Ga. 462\\n,\\n464-468 (\\n796 SE2d 261\\n) (2017). Appellant amended the motion for new trial\\nwith new counsel on June 15, 2021, and February 6, 2023. After an evidentiary\\nhearing on February 22, 2023, the trial court entered an order denying the\\nmotion on April 28, 2023. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal, and the case\\nwas docketed in this Court to the August 2023 term and submitted for a\\ndecision on the briefs.\\n       2 Because this case involves questions of harmless error and prejudice\\n\\nstemming from ineffectiveness of counsel, we set out the evidence in detail\\nrather than in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict. See Wood v. State,\\n316 Ga. 811\\n, 812 n.2 (\\n890 SE2d 716\\n) (2023).\\n                                       2\\n others, and also sometimes lent his car to Appellant and others. Late\\n\\nin the evening on January 23, 2012, Atkinson was at his home in\\n\\nDouglas County celebrating his birthday with Deshanqueanna\\n\\nLundy, who was Appellant’s girlfriend. Early the next morning, on\\n\\nJanuary 24, Appellant was driven to Atkinson’s home by Cleo\\n\\nSimmons; Lisa Johnson was with them. Appellant delivered crack\\n\\nand powder cocaine to Atkinson, and the four consumed the drugs.\\n\\nLater that morning, Atkinson gave Appellant his ATM card so\\n\\nAppellant could withdraw money to pay for the drugs Appellant had\\n\\ndelivered. Appellant and Simmons left the home, drove to an ATM\\n\\nmachine, and used Atkinson’s ATM card to withdraw $300, which\\n\\nwas the daily limit for Atkinson’s ATM card; Appellant also bought\\n\\nadditional drugs. After Appellant and Simmons returned, the group\\n\\ncontinued to use drugs.\\n\\n     In the early afternoon, Appellant and Lundy borrowed\\n\\nAtkinson’s car and left. After dropping off Lundy, Appellant saw a\\n\\npolice officer who knew him and knew that he did not have a valid\\n\\ndriver’s license. To avoid being arrested for driving with a suspended\\n\\n                                  3\\n license, Appellant turned into a Travelodge motel in Fulton County\\n\\nnear the intersection of Fulton Industrial Boulevard and I-20, where\\n\\nhe sometimes stayed. Appellant parked Atkinson’s car and left.\\n\\n     In the early evening, Atkinson received a call from his friend\\n\\nCharlene Shivers. Shivers told Atkinson that she had seen his car\\n\\nat the Travelodge. Atkinson asked Shivers for a ride so he could pick\\n\\nup his car. When Atkinson and Shivers arrived at the Travelodge,\\n\\nthe police were preparing to impound the car, but Atkinson was able\\n\\nto retrieve it and drive it home. By the time Atkinson arrived back\\n\\nhome, Johnson and Simmons were gone.\\n\\n     Later that evening, Simmons drove Appellant back to\\n\\nAtkinson’s home. Appellant demanded payment for Lundy’s time\\n\\nand for the crack cocaine he had delivered earlier in the day;\\n\\nhowever, Atkinson did not have any cash. Atkinson, Appellant, and\\n\\nSimmons drove away in Atkinson’s car. During the drive, Atkinson\\n\\ntried to obtain cash by calling Shivers and his two daughters, who\\n\\nlived in Atlanta. He and Appellant also went to Shivers’s room at\\n\\nthe Skyway Inn, a motel near the intersection of Fulton Industrial\\n\\n                                 4\\n Boulevard and I-20. Atkinson was unable to obtain any cash, and\\n\\nafter leaving Shivers’s room, Appellant and Atkinson returned to\\n\\nthe car, and they picked up Johnson, who had been at the Skyway.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Atkinson either jumped or was pushed from the\\n\\ncar while it was in the middle of an intersection, and he was hit by\\n\\nat least one other car.\\n\\n     Atkinson was seriously injured, but he spoke with several\\n\\npeople at the scene before being transported to the hospital; he died\\n\\nfive days later. Maria Gallo, who was in another car in the\\n\\nintersection, testified she saw Atkinson in the middle of Fulton\\n\\nIndustrial Boulevard, screaming that he had been kidnapped by\\n\\nmen who wanted to kill him. He came over to her car and tried to\\n\\nopen the door. She saw two men get out of another car that was\\n\\nstopped in the intersection, walk over to Atkinson, scream at him in\\n\\nan “ugly” way, and aggressively try to take him away. Atkinson\\n\\ncontinued to scream for help, saying that the men were trying to kill\\n\\nhim, and telling the men to leave. When police officers arrived, the\\n\\ntwo men returned to their car and drove away quickly.\\n\\n                                 5\\n      Corporal David Jira of the Fulton County Police Department\\n\\nwas the first officer on the scene. Atkinson told him that he had been\\n\\nkidnapped at gunpoint from his home in Douglas County and that\\n\\nwhen he got to the intersection of Fulton Industrial and I-20, he was\\n\\npushed from the car. Atkinson told a paramedic at the scene that he\\n\\njumped out of a car because someone tried to kill him; the paramedic\\n\\ntestified at trial that Atkinson smelled of alcohol. About an hour\\n\\nlater, Cpl. Jira discovered Atkinson’s car parked by a gas pump at a\\n\\ngas station about a mile from the intersection where Atkinson had\\n\\nbeen injured. Cpl. Jira was familiar with Appellant and knew that\\n\\nhe had been identified as a suspect. He saw Appellant inside the gas\\n\\nstation, and when Appellant came out to Atkinson’s car, Cpl. Jira\\n\\ndetained him and asked his name; Appellant answered by giving his\\n\\nbrother’s name. After being told why he was being detained,\\n\\nAppellant stated that what was alleged was not true; that he did not\\n\\npush Atkinson from the car; and that Atkinson owed his girlfriend\\n\\napproximately $700. When Cpl. Jira confirmed that Appellant had\\n\\ngiven him the wrong name, he arrested him. No drugs or weapons\\n\\n                                  6\\n were found in the car or on Appellant’s person at the time of his\\n\\narrest.\\n\\n     At trial, the State presented evidence showing that the cause\\n\\nof Atkinson’s death five days after his admission to the hospital was\\n\\nblood clots, which were a consequence of injuries he received when\\n\\nhe fell out of a moving vehicle; the evidence included the medical\\n\\nexaminer’s testimony, his hospital medical records, and the autopsy\\n\\nreport. Specifically, the medical examiner, who performed the\\n\\nautopsy, testified that the cause of death was right pulmonary and\\n\\nbilateral bone thromboembli, or blood clots, due to pelvic, rib, and\\n\\nvertebral fractures. She explained that blood clots were not\\n\\nuncommon when a person has a fracture of the thigh or arm or a\\n\\npelvic fracture; she also noted that blood clots can take time to\\n\\ndevelop. She classified the manner of death as a homicide.\\n\\nAdditionally, the medical records showed that on the morning of\\n\\nAtkinson’s death, he had developed an altered mental status, which\\n\\nthe medical examiner testified can be caused by blood clots. The\\n\\nmedical examiner acknowledged that Atkinson did not have rib\\n\\n                                 7\\n fractures upon his admission to the hospital, and she opined that he\\n\\nmay have sustained the rib fractures as a result of having to be\\n\\nrestrained due to his altered mental status or as a result of\\n\\nresuscitation efforts. She also opined that the large blood clot that\\n\\nwas visible when she did the autopsy would not have come from the\\n\\nrib fracture because he did not have the rib fracture when he was\\n\\nadmitted to the hospital. On cross-examination, she acknowledged\\n\\nthat the autopsy did not reveal any injury to Atkinson’s neck.\\n\\n     The State called Johnson and Shivers as witnesses. Johnson’s\\n\\npretrial interview with Lieutenant John Cross of the Fulton County\\n\\nPolice Department was audio- and video-recorded and played for the\\n\\njury. In that interview, she explained that she was in the car with\\n\\nAtkinson, Appellant, and Simmons late on the evening of January\\n\\n24, 2012. Atkinson was driving, Appellant was in the passenger\\n\\nseat, and Simmons was sitting behind Appellant. Appellant and\\n\\nAtkinson were having a heated argument about money that\\n\\nAppellant said Atkinson owed him. Atkinson was talking on the\\n\\nphone with Shivers and others, trying to get money. Atkinson said\\n\\n                                 8\\n he would drive back to the Skyway, but Appellant said he did not\\n\\nwant to go that way. Atkinson did not appear to be afraid and told\\n\\nAppellant that he would get money in the morning. When Atkinson\\n\\nstarted to get into a turn lane to turn back toward the Skyway,\\n\\nAppellant got angry and grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the car\\n\\nto go in a different direction. At the next intersection, Atkinson\\n\\nslowed the car, opened the door, and rolled out. The car continued\\n\\nmoving until it hit a barrier, and Appellant got in the driver’s seat\\n\\nand drove onto I-20. While Atkinson was standing in the\\n\\nintersection, saying “help me, help me,” Johnson walked back to the\\n\\nSkyway. Johnson never saw anyone with a gun in the car, although\\n\\nshe had seen Appellant with guns in the past.\\n\\n     At trial, Johnson’s testimony about what happened on January\\n\\n24 was largely consistent with her pretrial statement. However, she\\n\\ntestified that Appellant and Atkinson were not having a discussion\\n\\nbut were both on their phones and that Atkinson was trying to get\\n\\nmoney so that he could pay her because she was planning to spend\\n\\nthe night with him, and he did not want her to have to wait for her\\n\\n                                 9\\n money until the morning. She also testified that Appellant told\\n\\nAtkinson, “You driving crazy, you drunk”; that Appellant asked to\\n\\nbe dropped off; that when Appellant grabbed the steering wheel, he\\n\\ntold Atkinson, “You finna kill us turning into oncoming traffic”; and\\n\\nthat after Atkinson rolled out of the car, Appellant put the car in\\n\\npark, got out of the car, and she “suppose[d]” he talked to Atkinson.\\n\\nShe testified that she did not see what happened to Atkinson’s car.\\n\\n     According to Shivers’s trial testimony, Atkinson called her\\n\\nwhile he was in the car with Appellant, asked for money, and said\\n\\nAppellant “was down there with a gun demanding money.” Even\\n\\nthough Shivers told Atkinson she did not have money, he came to\\n\\nher door at the Skyway; Appellant stood behind him and had his\\n\\nhands in his jacket. When Shivers said she did not have any money,\\n\\nAppellant and Atkinson left. About ten minutes later, Atkinson\\n\\ncalled her again, but he was interrupted by Appellant “hollering” at\\n\\nhim to “go straight.” Then the call dropped. Shortly thereafter,\\n\\nShivers saw Johnson, who told her that Atkinson had been hit by a\\n\\ncar; that Simmons had been choking Atkinson; and that Appellant\\n\\n                                 10\\n had been hitting him. 3 Shivers ran to the scene and saw Atkinson\\n\\nbeing loaded into an ambulance; he told her that Appellant tried to\\n\\nkill him.\\n\\n     The State also called Atkinson’s daughter Felicia, and she\\n\\ntestified that her father called her the night of January 24, asking\\n\\nfor money, which was very unusual. She also had a conversation\\n\\nwith him while he was in the hospital. During that conversation, he\\n\\nsaid that Appellant, Johnson, and Simmons came to his home\\n\\nuninvited. Appellant brought drugs that they all shared and then\\n\\ndemanded he pay for everything when they finished. When he said\\n\\nhe would not pay, someone slapped a beer bottle out of his hand,\\n\\npulled a gun on him, and made him get in his car to go get money.\\n\\nThe people with him were choking him, poking him with a gun, and\\n\\nsaying they would take him to a hotel off Fulton Industrial\\n\\nBoulevard to kill him. Felicia testified that she went to her father’s\\n\\nhome after visiting him in the hospital and saw an opened bottle of\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 On cross-examination, Shivers admitted that she had not told officers\\n\\nin her pretrial statements that Johnson said Atkinson had been choked.\\n                                    11\\n beer on the living room floor.\\n\\n     Appellant was interviewed on February 6 by Lt. Cross; that\\n\\ninterview was audio-recorded, and a portion was played for the jury.\\n\\nIn that interview, Appellant said that Atkinson owed him money for\\n\\ndrugs and for prostitutes. He admitted that during the drive on\\n\\nJanuary 24, he was yelling at Atkinson about the money; he was\\n\\nplanning to take Atkinson to an apartment where Atkinson had\\n\\nnever been and hold him there until after midnight when Atkinson\\n\\ncould withdraw money from an ATM; he was “dead serious” about\\n\\nnot going back to the Skyway; and he grabbed the steering wheel\\n\\nright before Atkinson jumped out of the car.\\n\\n     Appellant testified in his own defense as follows. He lived at\\n\\nthe Travelodge and dealt drugs for a living. On January 24, 2012,\\n\\nSimmons drove him to Atkinson’s home to deliver drugs that Lundy\\n\\nhad requested. He, Atkinson, Simmons, and Lundy shared the\\n\\ndrugs. At the time, Atkinson owed Appellant $300 for Lundy’s\\n\\ncompany and $400 for the drugs. Atkinson wanted more crack after\\n\\nfinishing the drugs Appellant brought, so he sent Appellant and\\n\\n                                 12\\n Simmons in his car with his ATM card to get cash. Appellant\\n\\nretrieved $300 — the daily limit — and purchased the crack and\\n\\nreturned to Atkinson’s home. At about 1:00 p.m., Appellant and\\n\\nLundy left the home, borrowing Atkinson’s car with his permission.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Atkinson called Appellant and asked him to pick\\n\\nup more drugs. Appellant went to a hotel near the Skyway to pick\\n\\nup the crack, but a police officer who knew he was driving on a\\n\\nsuspended license saw him. Appellant went upstairs to wait for the\\n\\npolice to leave but left the car running with his cell phone in the car.\\n\\nThe police called a tow truck to impound the car, but Shivers and\\n\\nAtkinson arrived in time to take the car. Appellant believed that\\n\\nAtkinson told the police that he stole the car.\\n\\n     Later, Appellant returned to Atkinson’s home with more crack.\\n\\nAtkinson and Appellant argued about Atkinson telling the police\\n\\nAppellant had stolen his car, and Appellant knocked a beer bottle\\n\\nout of Atkinson’s hand while Atkinson was sitting in a chair.\\n\\nAppellant told Atkinson the crack he just picked up had to be paid\\n\\nfor. Atkinson and Appellant left in Atkinson’s car to get the money;\\n\\n                                  13\\n Atkinson was driving, Appellant was in the front passenger seat,\\n\\nand Simmons was in the back seat. Their first stop was the Skyway\\n\\nto ask Shivers for money. After that visit was unsuccessful, they saw\\n\\nJohnson across the street and picked her up. Johnson suggested\\n\\nthey go to the truck stop to ask someone they knew there for money.\\n\\nThey drove to the truck stop, but police officers were there, so they\\n\\ndid not stop and headed back toward the Skyway. Police were also\\n\\npresent at a store near the Skyway. Appellant had become irritated\\n\\nand saw Atkinson was about to turn toward the Skyway into\\n\\noncoming traffic, so Appellant grabbed the steering wheel. The car\\n\\ncontinued forward while Atkinson argued with everybody in the car\\n\\nand someone on the phone about how he “bent over backwards” for\\n\\nthem, but nobody would help him. Atkinson jumped from the car at\\n\\nthe next light, and a car hit him while he stood in the street.\\n\\nAppellant placed the car in park and got out. Another car then\\n\\nstruck Atkinson, and Atkinson leaned up against that car. Appellant\\n\\nunsuccessfully attempted to get Atkinson back in the car and noticed\\n\\na man calling the police. He decided to leave in Atkinson’s car\\n\\n                                 14\\n because he had outstanding warrants and because of the drugs in\\n\\nthe car. He told Atkinson he was leaving and that because of the\\n\\ndrugs and cup of liquor in the car, “the police was going to come” and\\n\\nthat Atkinson “was going to go to jail.” He told Simmons to tell\\n\\nJohnson to stay and tell the police what happened. He drove away\\n\\nand hid the drugs at a gas station, and then he drove to another gas\\n\\nstation near the scene of the incident.\\n\\n      During the cross-examination of Appellant, the State\\n\\nquestioned him about seven of his prior convictions — two for theft\\n\\nby taking a motor vehicle, four for providing false information to law\\n\\nenforcement, and one for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\\n\\n      2. Appellant raises several contentions in challenging the\\n\\nconstitutional sufficiency of the evidence for his convictions for\\n\\nfelony murder and for theft by taking. 4 In reviewing a challenge to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Because we no longer automatically review sua sponte the sufficiency\\n\\nof the evidence, except that of murder convictions resulting in the death\\npenalty, see Davenport v. State, \\n309 Ga. 385\\n, 398-399 (\\n846 SE2d 83\\n) (2020),\\nwe limit our consideration to the specific arguments that Appellant makes in\\nchallenging the sufficiency of the evidence. See Scoggins v. State, \\n317 Ga. 832\\n,\\n837 n.6 (\\n896 SE2d 476\\n) (2023).\\n                                      15\\n the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence, we review the evidence\\n\\nin the light most favorable to the verdict. See Jackson v. Virginia,\\n\\n443 U.S. 307\\n, 319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). Our review\\n\\n“leaves to the jury the resolution of conflicts in the evidence, the\\n\\nweight of the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and reasonable\\n\\ninferences to be made from basic facts to ultimate facts.” Wilkerson\\n\\nv. State, \\n317 Ga. 242\\n, 245 (\\n892 SE2d 737\\n) (2023) (cleaned up).\\n\\n     (a) Appellant first argues that there was insufficient evidence\\n\\nthat Atkinson’s death was caused by the injuries he received after\\n\\nhe fell out of the car and that the State failed to prove that the\\n\\nunderlying felony of aggravated assault with intent to rob had a\\n\\nsufficient nexus to Atkinson’s death. These arguments implicate two\\n\\nelements of felony murder — proximate cause and that the victim’s\\n\\ndeath must be caused “in the commission of” the predicate felony.\\n\\nSee OCGA § 16-5-1 (c); Eubanks v. State, \\n317 Ga. 563\\n, 569, 571-572\\n\\n(\\n894 SE2d 27\\n) (2023). “Proximate cause is satisfied for purposes of\\n\\nfelony murder when the death was a reasonably foreseeable result\\n\\nof the criminal conduct at issue,” and the proximate cause element\\n\\n                                 16\\n “is met even if the death had an intervening act, so long as that\\n\\nintervening act was itself a reasonably foreseeable consequence of\\n\\nthe criminal conduct.” Id. at 571 (cleaned up). The “in the\\n\\ncommission of” element requires that “the predicate felony must be\\n\\nat least concurrent with the homicide in part, and be a part of it in\\n\\nan actual or material sense.” Id. at 572 (cleaned up).\\n\\n     With regard to proximate cause, Appellant points to evidence\\n\\nthat while hospitalized, Atkinson developed an altered mental\\n\\nstatus, had to be restrained, and fought against the restraints.\\n\\nAppellant argues that Atkinson’s rib fractures were likely a result\\n\\nof these complications and that the blood clots that caused\\n\\nAtkinson’s death could have resulted from the rib fractures. He\\n\\nargues that such complications are reasonably foreseeable in a\\n\\nhospital setting and could have been the proximate cause of\\n\\nAtkinson’s death.\\n\\n     These arguments, however, rely on a view of the evidence that\\n\\nis most favorable to the defense, rather than to the verdict, which is\\n\\nthe proper standard. See Jackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n. Moreover, the\\n\\n                                 17\\n medical records and the testimony of the medical examiner, viewed\\n\\nin the light most favorable to the verdicts, were sufficient for a\\n\\nrational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the cause\\n\\nof death was blood clots resulting from the injuries Atkinson\\n\\nsustained on January 24. See, e.g., Harris v. State, \\n313 Ga. 653\\n, 656-\\n\\n657 (\\n872 SE2d 732\\n) (2022) (evidence sufficient to establish nexus\\n\\nbetween defendant’s shooting of victim and victim’s death from\\n\\nblood clots resulting from being shot); Treadaway v. State, \\n308 Ga.\\n\\n882\\n, 884-885 (\\n843 SE2d 784\\n) (2020) (holding that evidence was\\n\\nsufficient and “whether [defendant’s] actions were the sole cause of\\n\\n[her husband’s] death or would have otherwise caused his death\\n\\nunder different circumstances is immaterial,” where evidence\\n\\nshowed defendant beat her highly intoxicated, disabled husband\\n\\nwith a metal broom while he was in the bathtub and cause of death\\n\\nwas drowning and blunt-force trauma (cleaned up)). See also\\n\\nEberhart v. State, \\n307 Ga. 254\\n, 260-262 (\\n835 SE2d 192\\n) (2019)\\n\\n(evidence sufficient to uphold felony murder conviction based on\\n\\naggravated assault where medical examiner testified that the victim\\n\\n                                  18\\n died from hypertensive cardiovascular disease exacerbated by\\n\\nphysical exertion and TASER application).\\n\\n     With regard to the “in the commission of” element, Appellant\\n\\nargues that Atkinson voluntarily exited the car; that there was no\\n\\nphysical evidence that Atkinson had been choked; and that Johnson\\n\\nsaid that she did not see a gun. Again, these arguments rely on a\\n\\nview of the evidence that is most favorable to the defense. The\\n\\nevidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, was\\n\\nsufficient to authorize a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt that just before Atkinson exited the car, Appellant was\\n\\nthreatening Atkinson with bodily harm if he did not pay the money\\n\\nowed; and that Appellant either pushed Atkinson out of the car, or\\n\\nAtkinson, in reasonable fear for his life, jumped out of the car. This\\n\\nevidence was sufficient to support Appellant’s conviction for felony\\n\\nmurder while in the commission of aggravated assault with intent\\n\\nto rob. See, e.g., Adcock v. State, \\n279 Ga. App. 473\\n, 473-474 (\\n631\\n\\nSE2d 494\\n) (2006) (evidence was sufficient to support conviction for\\n\\naggravated assault with intent to rob where victim testified that\\n\\n                                 19\\n defendant jumped in car, demanded money, and threatened him\\n\\nwith knife, and where defendant testified that he entered car\\n\\nbecause victim owed him money but that he did not threaten victim).\\n\\nSee also Wayne R. LaFave et al., Substantive Criminal Law § 6.4 (h)\\n\\n(October 2023 online update) (“[i]mpulsive acts of the victim in an\\n\\neffort to escape being harmed by the defendant’s conduct” are\\n\\nsufficient to establish causation between defendant’s commission of\\n\\nfelony and victim’s death).\\n\\n     (b) Appellant also contends that there was insufficient evidence\\n\\nthat he harbored an intent to deprive Atkinson of his car, a required\\n\\nelement of his conviction for theft by taking of Atkinson’s car. See\\n\\nOCGA § 16-8-2. Appellant points to testimony that Atkinson would\\n\\noften help his friends financially and would lend them his car, as\\n\\nwell as own testimony that he had no intent to deprive Atkinson of\\n\\nhis car. However, Appellant again fails to view the evidence in the\\n\\nlight most favorable to the verdict. The evidence, viewed in the\\n\\nproper light, authorized the jury to find that Appellant, either by\\n\\nforce or intimidation, caused Atkinson to exit the car; drove\\n\\n                                 20\\n Atkinson’s car away while Atkinson was screaming for help; and lied\\n\\nabout his identity when found in possession of the car. This evidence\\n\\nwas sufficient to permit the jury to infer that Appellant intended to\\n\\ndeprive Atkinson of his car, either permanently or temporarily. See\\n\\nOCGA § 16-8-1 (1) (a) (defining “deprive” as withholding, without\\n\\njustification, “property of another permanently or temporarily”).\\n\\n     Moreover, the jury was not required to credit Appellant’s\\n\\ntestimony as to his intent to help Atkinson by taking the car away\\n\\nbecause it had drugs in it. In fact, if the jury disbelieved Appellant’s\\n\\ntestimony, such testimony could serve as substantive evidence that\\n\\nhis intent was to deprive Atkinson of his property. See Maynor v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 492\\n, 498 (\\n893 SE2d 724\\n) (2023) (jurors are “authorized\\n\\nto consider their disbelief in Appellant’s testimony . . . as substantive\\n\\nevidence of his guilt”). Under the proper standard of review set forth\\n\\nabove, we conclude that the evidence at trial was sufficient to\\n\\nauthorize a rational trier of fact to find that Appellant committed\\n\\ntheft by taking. See, e.g., Jones v. State, \\n303 Ga. 496\\n, 497-499 (\\n813\\n\\nSE2d 360\\n) (2018) (evidence sufficient to support theft by taking\\n\\n                                   21\\n conviction where, after shooting his cousin, defendant drove away\\n\\nfrom scene in his cousin’s girlfriend’s car, without her permission,\\n\\nand was still in possession of car when apprehended by police); Shaw\\n\\nv. State, \\n247 Ga. App. 867\\n, 871-872 (\\n545 SE2d 399\\n) (2001) (evidence\\n\\nsufficient to support intent element of conviction for theft by taking\\n\\nwhere there was evidence suggesting that the victim may have given\\n\\nthe defendant her car keys, but there were also circumstances,\\n\\nincluding defendant’s demeanor toward victim and when confronted\\n\\nby officers, that permitted jury to infer defendant’s criminal intent\\n\\nto deprive victim of her property).\\n\\n     3.   Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to grant\\n\\na new trial as a “thirteenth juror” under OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-\\n\\n21. OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, respectively, allow the trial court to\\n\\ngrant a new trial “[i]n any case when the verdict of a jury is found\\n\\ncontrary to evidence and the principles of justice and equity,” or\\n\\nwhen “the verdict may be decidedly and strongly against the weight\\n\\nof the evidence even though there may appear to be some slight\\n\\nevidence in favor of the finding.” “Grounds for a new trial under\\n\\n                                 22\\n these Code sections are commonly known as the ‘general grounds,’”\\n\\nand these statutes “give the trial court broad discretion to sit as a\\n\\nthirteenth juror and weigh the evidence on a motion for new trial\\n\\nalleging these general grounds.” Allen v. State, \\n315 Ga. 524\\n, 531 n.5\\n\\n(\\n883 SE2d 746\\n) (2023) (cleaned up).\\n\\n      Appellant’s claim is not subject to our review because the\\n\\ndecision to grant or deny a new trial under these statutes is vested\\n\\nsolely within the discretion of the trial court and is not subject to\\n\\nreview on appeal. See Ridley v. State, \\n315 Ga. 452\\n, 456 (\\n883 SE2d\\n\\n357\\n) (2023).5 To the extent that Appellant contends that the trial\\n\\ncourt failed to exercise its discretion as a “thirteenth juror” by his\\n\\nargument that the trial court failed “to address the specific issues\\n\\nraised in the amended motion for new trial,” the record clearly\\n\\ndemonstrates otherwise. The trial court’s order on the motion for\\n\\nnew trial stated that it “has reviewed the evidence of record,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 See also King v. State, \\n316 Ga. 611\\n, 616 n.8 (\\n889 SE2d 851\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(noting many Justices’ skepticism about prior case law that imported an\\nanalysis of the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence into the consideration\\nof a “thirteenth juror” claim).\\n                                       23\\n including re-examining such factors as the weight of the evidence\\n\\nand credibility of the witnesses . . . as an independent fact finder.”6\\n\\nThus, the trial court plainly applied the proper standard under\\n\\nOCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, and this claim fails.\\n\\n      4.    Appellant challenges the admission of his post-arrest\\n\\ninterview by police on the sole ground that he was not advised of his\\n\\nrights under Miranda v. Arizona, \\n384 U.S. 436\\n (86 SCt 1602, 16\\n\\nLE2d 694) (1966). “To use a defendant’s custodial statements in its\\n\\ncase-in-chief, the State must show that the defendant was advised\\n\\nof his Miranda rights and that he voluntarily, knowingly, and\\n\\nintelligently waived them.” Huffman v. State, \\n311 Ga. 891\\n, 893 (\\n860\\n\\nSE2d 721\\n) (2021) (cleaned up). A written waiver of rights is not\\n\\nnecessary; a suspect advised of his rights orally can waive them. See\\n\\nid. at 895\\n. In ruling upon the admissibility of a custodial statement,\\n\\na trial court must consider the totality of the circumstances. See \\nid.\\n\\nat 893\\n. We review a trial court’s factual findings and credibility\\n\\n\\n      6 The trial court’s order stated that Appellant’s second amended motion\\n\\nfor new trial raised “in a scattershot manner” “hosts of evidentiary complaints”;\\nthe trial court overruled the claims “en bloc.”\\n                                       24\\n determinations for clear error and apply the law de novo. White v.\\n\\nState, \\n307 Ga. 601\\n, 602 (\\n837 SE2d 838\\n) (2020).\\n\\n      On February 6, 2012, Lt. Cross spoke to Appellant at the\\n\\nFulton County Jail and notified him that he was being charged with\\n\\nmurder in connection with Atkinson’s death. At trial, Lt. Cross\\n\\ntestified outside the presence of the jury that he explained to\\n\\nAppellant that he did not have to speak with him and held up a\\n\\nwaiver-of-rights form so Appellant could see it. There was no pen for\\n\\nAppellant to sign the form, but Appellant said, “I understand” and\\n\\nthat he wanted to speak with Lt. Cross. Additionally, Appellant\\n\\ntestified at trial that when Lt. Cross spoke with him, he understood\\n\\nhis Miranda rights and spoke with the officer willingly. Under these\\n\\ncircumstances, we conclude that this claim fails.\\n\\n      5.    Appellant also contends the trial court committed plain\\n\\nerror in several ways. 7 To show plain error, Appellant must identify\\n\\n\\n      7  We review assertions of plain error related to the admission or\\nexclusion of evidence under OCGA § 24-1-103 (a), (d), which together provide\\nthat “[e]rror shall not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes\\nevidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected,” and that “[n]othing\\n\\n                                       25\\n an error that was not affirmatively waived; that was clear and\\n\\nobvious beyond reasonable dispute; that affected his substantial\\n\\nrights, which generally requires an “affirmative showing” that the\\n\\nerror probably did affect the outcome below; and that the error\\n\\nseriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\\n\\njudicial proceedings. See Ruthenberg v. State, \\n317 Ga. 227\\n, 230-231\\n\\n(\\n892 SE2d 728\\n) (2023). “Satisfying all four prongs of this standard is\\n\\ndifficult, as it should be.” Id. at 231 (cleaned up).\\n\\n      (a) First, Appellant challenges the admission of certain\\n\\nevidence during the testimony of Gallo, who testified with the\\n\\nassistance of an interpreter, as hearsay, see OCGA § 24-8-802, and\\n\\nas a violation of his right of confrontation under the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Toward the\\n\\nconclusion of Gallo’s direct examination, she commented that her\\n\\nsister-in-law, who was in the car with her, was translating\\n\\nAtkinson’s statements from English into Spanish. Appellant’s trial\\n\\n\\nin this Code section shall preclude a court from taking notice of plain errors\\naffecting substantial rights although such errors were not brought to the\\nattention of the court.”\\n                                     26\\n counsel objected, arguing that Gallo’s testimony about Atkinson’s\\n\\nstatements was hearsay, because she was relying on her sister-in-\\n\\nlaw’s translation. The trial court asked the State for a response, and\\n\\nfollowing a bench conference, the State asked Gallo about her ability\\n\\nto understand English. Gallo testified that she understands some\\n\\nEnglish; that she had an independent understanding of what\\n\\nAtkinson was saying; and that she understood that Atkinson was\\n\\nscreaming, “They’re trying to kill me.” She also testified that her\\n\\nsister-in-law was translating because someone else in the car with\\n\\nthem did not understand any English. Following this testimony,\\n\\nAppellant did not ask for a ruling on his objection and did not renew\\n\\nit.\\n\\n      Appellant contends that Gallo’s reliance on her sister-in-law as\\n\\nan    interpreter   constituted   hearsay.   Pretermitting   whether\\n\\nAppellant affirmatively waived this objection, we conclude that the\\n\\ntrial court did not err, much less make a clear or obvious error in\\n\\nadmitting Gallo’s testimony, given the particular hearsay objection\\n\\nmade below and given Gallo’s clarification that her testimony was\\n\\n                                  27\\n based on her independent understanding of Atkinson’s statement\\n\\nthat “they’re trying to kill me.” Thus, Appellant has failed to show\\n\\nplain error.\\n\\n     Appellant also asserts, in a single sentence, that the admission\\n\\nof the testimony of Gallo’s sister-in-law violated his right of\\n\\nconfrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States\\n\\nConstitution. See Crawford v. Washington, \\n541 U. S. 36\\n (124 SCt\\n\\n1354, 158 LE2d 177) (2004). A confrontation clause violation under\\n\\nCrawford occurs when the out-of-court statement is “testimonial.”\\n\\nId.\\n See also Munn v. State, \\n313 Ga. 716\\n, 724 (\\n873 SE2d 166\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(statement is “testimonial” where “its primary purpose is to\\n\\nestablish evidence that could be used in a future prosecution”\\n\\n(cleaned up)). Here, however, Gallo’s sister-in-law’s translation of\\n\\nAtkinson’s cries to bystanders for help is not testimonial. See\\n\\nBulloch v. State, \\n293 Ga. 179\\n, 182-183 & n.3, 186 (\\n744 SE2d 763\\n)\\n\\n(2013) (rejecting argument that victim’s statement to brother\\n\\nidentifying defendant as person who should be suspected if\\n\\n“anything out of the ordinary happens” victim was testimonial\\n\\n                                 28\\n within meaning of Crawford). Therefore, this claim of plain error\\n\\nfails.\\n\\n         (b) Second, Appellant contends that the trial court plainly\\n\\nerred in allowing the prosecutor to use leading questions in\\n\\nexamining Gallo and to repeat questions to several witnesses that\\n\\nhad been asked and answered. However, Appellant has not set forth\\n\\nany of the allegedly improper questions or answers, instead, simply\\n\\nincluding string cites to pages of the trial transcript. With respect to\\n\\nthe allegedly leading questions, our review of the record shows that\\n\\nthey easily could have been rephrased in an unobjectionable way to\\n\\nelicit the same testimony. With respect to the questions that\\n\\nallegedly had previously been asked and answered, we conclude that\\n\\nthe answers given were cumulative of testimony that Appellant has\\n\\nnot challenged on appeal. Moreover, Appellant has failed to explain\\n\\nhow any of the alleged errors were of a nature to have “seriously\\n\\naffected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\\n\\nproceedings.” Ruthenberg, 317 Ga. at 230. Thus, Appellant has\\n\\nfailed to meet his burden of showing that the allegedly improper\\n\\n                                   29\\n questions likely affected the outcome of the trial. See McCalop v.\\n\\nState, \\n316 Ga. 363\\n, 375 (\\n887 SE2d 292\\n) (2023) (plain error claim fails\\n\\nwhen appellant cannot establish that allegedly improper testimony\\n\\nlikely affected outcome of trial); United States v. Coleman, 914 F3d\\n\\n508, 512 (7th Cir. 2019) (“even when they are improper, leading\\n\\nquestions rarely give rise to plain error”). See also Davis v. State,\\n\\n306 Ga. 140\\n, 149 (\\n829 SE2d 321\\n) (2019) (holding that appellant\\n\\nfailed to establish prejudice stemming from counsel’s failure to\\n\\nobject to leading questions because an objection was unlikely to have\\n\\nprevented the admission of the testimony); Grier v. State, \\n313 Ga.\\n\\n236\\n, 246 (\\n869 SE2d 423\\n) (2022) (equating the prejudice prong of the\\n\\nplain-error test with the prejudice prong for an ineffective-\\n\\nassistance claim).\\n\\n     (c) Third, Appellant contends that the trial court committed\\n\\nplain error in allowing the prosecutor to repeat Appellant’s\\n\\ntestimony in cross-examining Appellant. However, there is no error,\\n\\nmuch less a clear and obvious one, in a party exercising its right to\\n\\n“a thorough and sifting cross-examination,” OCGA § 24-6-611 (b),\\n\\n                                 30\\n and using leading questions to reiterate the witness’s testimony on\\n\\ndirect in doing so. See OCGA § 24-6-611 (c) (leading questions “shall\\n\\nbe permitted on cross-examination”).\\n\\n     (d) Fourth, Appellant contends that the trial court plainly\\n\\nerred by admitting facts underlying Appellant’s prior convictions.\\n\\nOutside the presence of the jury, the parties discussed the State’s\\n\\nability to impeach Appellant with proof of his prior convictions.\\n\\nWhen the trial court ruled that seven of Appellant’s prior convictions\\n\\n— including four for giving false information to law enforcement —\\n\\nwould be admissible, it also advised the parties that the State would\\n\\nnot be permitted to go into the details of the convictions. On cross-\\n\\nexamination, Appellant admitted he had been convicted of the prior\\n\\noffenses, and the State introduced, without objection, exhibits\\n\\nsupporting each conviction.8 The prosecutor also asked Appellant a\\n\\nfew questions about why he lied to law enforcement, whether he had\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     8  These exhibits included two indictments that contained counts for\\nwhich Appellant was not convicted. In this appeal, Appellant does not cite the\\nexhibits or make any argument related to their admission, and thus any issue\\nregarding them is not properly before us.\\n                                     31\\n experience trying to avoid arrest by giving a false name to officers,\\n\\nand referred to Appellant’s testimony on direct examination\\n\\nadmitting that he gave Cpl. Jira his brother’s name when he was\\n\\narrested.\\n\\n     OCGA § 24-6-609 (a) (1) (“Rule 609”) states that “evidence that\\n\\nan accused has been convicted of [a felony] shall be admitted if the\\n\\ncourt determines that the probative value of admitting the evidence\\n\\noutweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.” Rule 609 (a) (1) is\\n\\nidentical in all relevant respects to the corresponding federal rule,\\n\\nand in such circumstances, we look for guidance to federal case law,\\n\\nespecially case law from the United States Supreme Court and\\n\\nfederal appellate courts, including particularly the Eleventh Circuit\\n\\nCourt of Appeals. See Almanza v. State, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 556-558 (\\n820\\n\\nSE2d 1\\n) (2018) (when Georgia courts consider the meaning of the\\n\\ncurrent Evidence Code, they should be guided by federal case law,\\n\\nparticularly the decisions of the Eleventh Circuit, prior to its\\n\\nadoption, until a Georgia appellate court decides the issue under the\\n\\nnew Code). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 609 (a), while the fact of\\n\\n                                 32\\n the conviction, the nature of the conviction, and the punishment are\\n\\nall properly admitted, the specific facts and circumstances of the\\n\\nprior convictions generally are not admissible. See United States v.\\n\\nMorrow, 537 F2d 120, 141 n.31 (5th Cir. 1976);9 United States v.\\n\\nLopez-Medina, 596 F3d 716, 738 (10th Cir. 2010). 10\\n\\n      Pretermitting     whether     the    prosecutor’s    few    additional\\n\\nquestions about the false-information convictions were improper,\\n\\nAppellant has not made an affirmative showing that any such error\\n\\nprobably affected the outcome below, as required to prevail on his\\n\\nplain error claim. See Ruthenberg, 317 Ga. at 230-231. There was\\n\\noverwhelming evidence, including Appellant’s own testimony, that\\n\\nAtkinson exited the car because he reasonably feared for his life, as\\n\\nwell as substantial medical testimony that the injuries Atkinson\\n\\n\\n\\n      9  Decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered before the close of\\nbusiness on September 30, 1981, are binding in the Eleventh Circuit. See\\nBonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc).\\n      10 Appellant cited only cases decided under our former Code, and we have\\n\\nfound none addressing the specific issue under our current Code. Therefore, we\\nrely on federal case law. See Brown v. State, \\n307 Ga. 24\\n, 30 n.2 (\\n834 SE2d 40\\n)\\n(2019) (looking to federal case law to address harmless error in relation to\\nargument about the use of a conviction to impeach a witness other than the\\naccused).\\n                                     33\\n sustained on January 24 were the proximate cause of his death.\\n\\nAdditionally, Appellant admitted in his trial testimony that after\\n\\nbeing found in possession of Atkinson’s car, he provided a false name\\n\\nto Cpl. Jira, and the State’s closing argument made only a brief\\n\\nreference to Appellant’s prior convictions. See id. at 231 (holding\\n\\nthat any error in admitting evidence of prior convictions did not\\n\\nconstitute plain error where appellant failed to make affirmative\\n\\nshowing that admission likely affected outcome of trial).\\n\\n     (e) Finally, Appellant argues plain error based on his appellate\\n\\ncounsel’s inability to obtain transcripts for four pretrial hearings\\n\\nthat occurred under his first indictment, which was later\\n\\nsuperseded, and on the trial court’s limiting his time for questioning\\n\\nhis trial counsel at the hearing on the motion for new trial. However,\\n\\nthese alleged errors are not subject to plain-error review. See Keller\\n\\nv. State, \\n308 Ga. 492\\n, 497 (\\n842 SE2d 22\\n) (2020) (listing limited\\n\\ncategories of alleged errors for which plain-error review is available).\\n\\n     For all these reasons, Appellant’s claims of plain error fail.\\n\\n     6.    Next, we address Appellant’s contention that the trial\\n\\n                                  34\\n court abused its discretion in overruling several evidentiary\\n\\nobjections. We review a trial court’s rulings admitting or excluding\\n\\nevidence for an abuse of discretion. See Anglin v. State, \\n302 Ga. 333\\n,\\n\\n335 (\\n806 SE2d 573\\n) (2017). We will reverse a conviction for a trial\\n\\ncourt’s evidentiary error only if it was harmful. See \\nid. at 336\\n; OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-1-103 (a) (“Error shall not be predicated upon a ruling which\\n\\nadmits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party\\n\\nis affected.”). The test for determining nonconstitutional harmless\\n\\nerror is whether “it is highly probable that the error did not\\n\\ncontribute to the verdicts,” and in conducting that analysis, “we\\n\\nreview the record de novo and weigh the evidence as we would expect\\n\\nreasonable jurors to have done.” Brock v. State, \\n316 Ga. 256\\n, 260\\n\\n(\\n886 SE2d 786\\n) (2023) (cleaned up).\\n\\n     (a) Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling\\n\\nseveral objections during Lt. Cross’s testimony. First, he contends\\n\\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his hearsay\\n\\nobjection when Lt. Cross testified that Johnson said during her\\n\\npretrial interview that Appellant and Atkinson were having a\\n\\n                                 35\\n heated argument in the car. However, OCGA § 24-8-801 (d) (1) (A)\\n\\nprovides, in part, “[a]n out-of-court statement shall not be hearsay\\n\\nif the declarant testifies at the trial or hearing, is subject to cross-\\n\\nexamination concerning the statement, and the statement is\\n\\nadmissible as a prior inconsistent statement . . . under Code Section\\n\\n24-6-613 or is otherwise admissible under this chapter.” OCGA § 24-\\n\\n6-613 (b) provides, in relevant part, that “extrinsic evidence of a\\n\\nprior inconsistent statement by a witness shall not be admissible\\n\\nunless the witness is first afforded an opportunity to explain or deny\\n\\nthe prior inconsistent statement and the opposite party is afforded\\n\\nan opportunity to interrogate the witness on the prior inconsistent\\n\\nstatement or the interests of justice otherwise require.” Here, the\\n\\nrecording of Johnson’s pretrial interview was played for the jury,\\n\\nand Appellant cross-examined her about alleged inconsistencies\\n\\nbetween her pretrial statement and her trial testimony. Thus, Lt.\\n\\nCross’s testimony about Johnson’s statement was not inadmissible\\n\\nhearsay. See Neloms v. State, \\n313 Ga. 781\\n, 788-789 (\\n873 SE2d 125\\n)\\n\\n(2022) (investigator’s testimony about witness’s prior statements\\n\\n                                  36\\n was admissible as prior inconsistent statements where witness was\\n\\npresent at trial, was asked about statements to investigator, and\\n\\nwas subject to cross-examination).\\n\\n     Second, Appellant contends that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in overruling his objection to the prosecutor asking Lt.\\n\\nCross whether Appellant’s pretrial statement was consistent with\\n\\nfacts uncovered by the investigation, to which Lt. Cross responded,\\n\\n“There were some discrepancies.” On appeal, Appellant argues that\\n\\na witness may not give opinion testimony on the “ultimate issue,”\\n\\nciting case law decided under the former Evidence Code. However,\\n\\nat trial Appellant provided no basis for his objection, stating merely\\n\\n“objection.” See OCGA § 24-1-103 (a) (1). We pretermit whether the\\n\\ntrial court abused its discretion in overruling Appellant’s objection.\\n\\nCompare OCGA § 24-7-701 (a) (1)-(2) (authorizing the admission of\\n\\nwitness testimony in the form of a lay opinion where it is\\n\\n“[r]ationally based on the perception of the witness [and] [h]elpful to\\n\\na   clear   understanding   of   the   witness’s   testimony   or   the\\n\\ndetermination of a fact in issue”); Jones v. State, \\n299 Ga. 40\\n, 44 (785\\n\\n                                  37\\nSE2d 886\\n) (2016) (no plain error in eliciting, on redirect, testimony\\n\\nfrom officer that evidence from eyewitness was more consistent with\\n\\nother facts uncovered in investigation than information provided by\\n\\ndefendant, where officer had been cross-examined about the manner\\n\\nin which she conducted investigation). We conclude that any error\\n\\nwas harmless because the jury ultimately heard, without objection,\\n\\ntestimony from multiple witnesses that contradicted Appellant’s\\n\\npretrial statement, and Lt. Cross’s response — that there were some\\n\\ndiscrepancies — was merely cumulative of that testimony.\\n\\n     Third, Appellant asserts that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in overruling a single “leading” objection when the\\n\\nprosecutor asked Lt. Cross if Appellant admitted in his pretrial\\n\\ninterview that he tried to get money from Atkinson. However,\\n\\nAppellant has failed to demonstrate harm given that the jury heard\\n\\nAppellant’s pretrial interview in which he admitted that he wanted\\n\\nAtkinson to pay him for the drugs. Thus, regardless of whether the\\n\\ntrial court abused its discretion in overruling the objection,\\n\\nAppellant has failed to demonstrate harm. See Merrit v. State, 310\\n\\n                                 38\\nGa. 433\\n, 438-439 (\\n851 SE2d 555\\n) (2020) (any error in allowing State\\n\\nto ask leading questions was harmless, in part, because much of\\n\\ntestimony elicited with leading questions was cumulative of other\\n\\nevidence).\\n\\n     (b) Appellant also contends that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in overruling his hearsay objection to testimony by\\n\\nAtkinson’s daughter Felicia about the conversation she had with her\\n\\nfather the day after he was admitted to the hospital. Regardless of\\n\\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion in overruling\\n\\nAppellant’s hearsay objection, any error was harmless because\\n\\nFelicia’s testimony was cumulative of the testimony of multiple\\n\\nother witnesses. See Leonard v. State, \\n316 Ga. 827\\n, 834 (\\n889 SE2d\\n\\n837\\n) (2023) (pretermitting whether trial court erred in admitting\\n\\nstatements victim made before his death and holding that any error\\n\\nwas harmless where substance of statements was cumulative of\\n\\nother properly admitted testimony). See also Anglin, \\n302 Ga. at 336\\n\\n\\n(“The   erroneous   admission   of    hearsay   is   harmless   where\\n\\nsubstantial, cumulative, legally admissible evidence of the same fact\\n\\n                                 39\\n is introduced.”).\\n\\n      For these reasons, Appellant’s claims that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion in overruling his evidentiary objections do not\\n\\nrequire reversal.\\n\\n      7.    Finally, Appellant contends that he was denied effective\\n\\nassistance of counsel due to his trial counsel’s decision to call the\\n\\nparamedic as a witness; failure to object to Cpl. Jira’s testimony that\\n\\ncriminal activity was frequent in the neighborhoods where Atkinson\\n\\nwas injured and Appellant was apprehended; and failure to retain\\n\\nan expert witness to address proximate cause.11 To establish his\\n\\nclaim of ineffectiveness of counsel, Appellant must prove both\\n\\ndeficient performance by his trial counsel and resulting prejudice.\\n\\nSee Strickland v. Washington, \\n466 U.S. 668\\n, 687 (104 SCt 2052, 80\\n\\n\\n\\n      11  In the “plain error” enumerations addressed in Division 5 above,\\nAppellant asserts “alternatively” that trial counsel was ineffective. However,\\nhe makes no substantive argument regarding trial counsel’s alleged\\ndeficiencies in these matters. Accordingly, we do not address these claims of\\nineffectiveness. See Former Supreme Court Rule 22 (“Any enumerated error\\nnot supported by argument or citation of authority in the brief shall be deemed\\nabandoned.”). Our Rule 22 (1) now provides, “Any enumerated error or subpart\\nof an enumerated error not supported by argument, citations to authority, and\\ncitations to the record shall be deemed abandoned.”\\n                                      40\\n LE2d 674) (1984). To establish deficient performance, Appellant\\n\\nmust show that his attorney’s acts or omissions were “objectively\\n\\nunreasonable . . . considering all the circumstances and in the light\\n\\nof prevailing professional norms.” Davis v. State, \\n299 Ga. 180\\n, 182-\\n\\n183 (\\n787 SE2d 221\\n) (2016). The law recognizes a “strong\\n\\npresumption” that counsel performed reasonably, which the\\n\\ndefendant bears the burden of overcoming. Strickland, \\n466 U.S. at\\n\\n689\\n. To establish the required prejudice, Appellant must show that\\n\\nbut for his attorney’s objectively unreasonable errors, there is a\\n\\nreasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have\\n\\nbeen different. See \\nid. at 694\\n. “A reasonable probability is a\\n\\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” \\nId.\\n\\n\\nWe “need not address both components of the inquiry if the\\n\\ndefendant makes an insufficient showing on one.” Davis, \\n299 Ga. at\\n\\n183\\n. (cleaned up).\\n\\n     (a) Appellant asserts that trial counsel was deficient in calling\\n\\nthe paramedic as a witness because her testimony — that Atkinson\\n\\nsaid he jumped out of the car because people were trying to kill him\\n\\n                                 41\\n — corroborated the State’s theory of the case. At the hearing on the\\n\\nmotion for new trial, trial counsel testified that he called the\\n\\nparamedic because her report indicated that Atkinson told her a\\n\\ndifferent version of events than he had told his daughter. He also\\n\\ntestified that he tried to interview the paramedic before trial, but\\n\\nshe was “hesitant” to talk to him. At trial, trial counsel did not\\n\\nattempt to impeach the paramedic with her report, and the report\\n\\nwas not admitted into evidence.\\n\\n     However, assuming that trial counsel was professionally\\n\\ndeficient in calling the paramedic to testify, Appellant has failed to\\n\\ndemonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that the\\n\\nparamedic’s testimony affected the outcome of the case, given that\\n\\nthe paramedic’s testimony was cumulative of Gallo’s testimony that\\n\\nshe heard Atkinson yelling that he had been kidnapped and that\\n\\nmen were trying to kill him. See generally Payne v. State, \\n314 Ga.\\n\\n322\\n, 330 (\\n877 SE2d 202\\n) (2022) (any deficiency in counsel’s failure\\n\\nto object to alleged hearsay was not prejudicial where the testimony\\n\\nwas cumulative); Koonce v. State, \\n305 Ga. 671\\n, 675 (\\n827 SE2d 633\\n)\\n\\n                                  42\\n (2019) (appellant failed to show prejudice from trial counsel’s failure\\n\\nto object to certain testimony that was largely cumulative of other\\n\\nevidence).\\n\\n     (b) Cpl. Jira testified that he was frequently called to respond\\n\\nto reports of criminal activity around the accident scene and around\\n\\nthe location where Appellant was apprehended. Appellant contends\\n\\nthat his trial counsel was professionally deficient in failing to object\\n\\nto this testimony because it was irrelevant and served only to\\n\\ninflame the jury. However, even assuming that the evidence was\\n\\nirrelevant and properly subject to an objection under OCGA § 24-4-\\n\\n402 (“Evidence which is not relevant shall not be admissible.”),\\n\\nAppellant has not shown that his trial counsel’s failure to object was\\n\\npatently unreasonable, given that the testimony was cumulative of\\n\\nthe testimony of several other witnesses and consistent with\\n\\nAppellant’s own testimony that he was involved in criminal activity\\n\\nand frequented those areas. Thus, Appellant has not shown that his\\n\\ncounsel was deficient in failing to object to Cpl. Jira’s testimony. See\\n\\nSawyer v. State, \\n308 Ga. 375\\n, 384 (\\n839 SE2d 582\\n) (2020) (trial\\n\\n                                  43\\n counsel not deficient in failing to object to cumulative testimony).\\n\\n     (c) Appellant asserts that trial counsel was deficient in failing\\n\\nto utilize an expert witness to counter the testimony of the medical\\n\\nexaminer as to the cause of Atkinson’s death. Trial counsel testified\\n\\nthat causation is a difficult issue for a defense attorney given\\n\\nexisting case law. He also explained that his strategy was to show\\n\\nthat Appellant’s actions did not cause Atkinson to jump out of the\\n\\ncar and that Atkinson instead jumped out of the car due to the\\n\\nintoxicating effects of cocaine and alcohol. Even assuming that trial\\n\\ncounsel was deficient in not retaining a medical expert on proximate\\n\\ncause, Appellant has failed to establish prejudice. At the hearing on\\n\\nthe motion for new trial, Appellant did not present the testimony of,\\n\\nor an affidavit from, an expert witness that countered the State’s\\n\\nmedical expert. Accordingly, Appellant has failed to show Strickland\\n\\nprejudice. See Pauldo v. State, \\n317 Ga. 433\\n, 437 (\\n893 SE2d 633\\n)\\n\\n(2023) (“It is well established that a defendant fails to establish\\n\\nprejudice under Strickland when he merely contends that trial\\n\\ncounsel was deficient for failing to present an expert, without also\\n\\n                                  44\\n presenting evidence at the motion-for-new-trial hearing about what\\n\\nthe potential expert would have testified to at trial.”).\\n\\n      Accordingly, Appellant’s claims that he was denied effective\\n\\nassistance of counsel fail. 12\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      12 Appellant states in passing that the collective prejudice from trial\\ncounsel’s deficiencies “has the potential” to establish prejudice under\\nStrickland, but he fails to make any argument as to how he was prejudiced by\\nthe cumulative effect of the alleged deficiencies. He also states in the final\\nsentence of his brief that the claims raised on appeal “individually and\\ncollectively” require reversal. However, he again fails to make any argument\\nthat the collective prejudice from the alleged deficiencies of his trial counsel\\nand from the alleged trial court errors requires reversal. See State v. Lane, \\n308\\nGa. 10\\n, 18 (\\n838 SE2d 808\\n) (2020) (“A defendant who wishes to take advantage\\nof the [cumulative error rule] should explain to the reviewing court just how\\nhe was prejudiced by the cumulative effect of multiple errors.” (cleaned up)).\\nIn any event, we conclude that Appellant has failed to establish that the\\ncombined prejudicial effect of the five assumed trial court errors of an\\nevidentiary nature, which we address in Divisions 5 and 6, and the three\\nassumed instances of deficient performance of trial counsel denied him a\\nfundamentally fair trial. See, e.g., Huff v. State, \\n315 Ga. 558\\n, 568 (\\n883 SE2d\\n773\\n) (2023) (rejecting cumulative error claim “because Appellant has not\\ndemonstrated that the prejudicial effect of the assumed trial court errors and\\nineffective assistance denied him a fundamentally fair trial”).\\n                                       45\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9481016/sinkfield-v-state/'}),\n",

STATE v. JONES.\\n\\n      LAND, Judge.\\n\\n      In this case, the State appeals from the trial court’s dismissal of several\\n\\nmisdemeanor traffic offenses as barred by the statutes of limitation, arguing that the\\n\\ntrial court erred by incorrectly calculating the tolling period established by the\\n\\nSupreme Court of Georgia’s orders establishing and extending a statewide judicial\\n\\nemergency during the COVID-19 pandemic. We agree and reverse.\\n\\n      Iqukema Jones was arrested on June 7, 2020 in connection with a traffic\\n\\naccident in Marietta. On March 21, 2023, more than two years after the incident, the\\n\\nState filed accusations against Jones for less-safe driving under the influence of alcohol\\n (DUI) and other misdemeanor traffic offenses. The accusations included the following\\n\\nlanguage regarding the tolling of the statute of limitations:\\n\\n       [A]s to the offense(s) charged herein, the period in which a prosecution\\n       must be commenced under OCGA § 17-3-1 and other applicable statutes\\n       does not include the dates beginning March 14, 2020, and ending June\\n       30, 2021, pursuant to the Supreme Court of Georgia Order Declaring\\n       Statewide Judicial Emergency issued on March 14, 2020, and subsequent\\n       Orders Extending Declaration of Statewide Judicial Emergeny issued on\\n       April 6, May 11, June 12, July 10, August 11, September 10, October 10,\\n       November 9, and December 9, 2020, and January 8, February 7, March\\n       9, 2021, April 8, 2021, May 8, 2021, and June 7, 2021.\\n\\n\\n       At a motions hearing before the trial court on September 11, 2023, the trial\\n\\ncourt raised a concern about whether the statute of limitations had run prior to the\\n\\naccusations in this case. Defense counsel did not contest that the case had been\\n\\naccused within the statute of limitations but stated that the statute of limitations in this\\n\\ncase had been tolled for 474 days due to the Georgia Supreme Court’s orders\\n\\nestablishing and extending a statewide judicial emergency during the COVID-19\\n\\npandemic. On September 15, the trial court issued an order dismissing the case for\\n\\nviolating the applicable statute of limitation. Specifically, the trial court’s order cited\\n\\nto the guidance provided in our Supreme Court’s July 10, 2020 Fourth Order\\n\\n                                             2\\n Extending Declaration of Statewide Judicial Emergency and concluded that the statute\\n\\nof limitation in Jones’ case had been extended only 122 days. The trial court further\\n\\nconcluded that the limitation period in Jones’ case began to run on July 14, 2020 and\\n\\nthus, “the case against this Defendant should have been accused no later than July 14,\\n\\n2022.” The State appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in its calculation of the\\n\\ntolling period for the statute of limitation.\\n\\n      We review legal errors with respect to statute of limitation issues de novo. See\\n\\nState v. Conzo, \\n293 Ga. App. 72\\n, 73 (\\n666 SE2d 404\\n) (2008).\\n\\n      Prior to Jones’ arrest in June 2020,\\n\\n      [o]n March 14, 2020, pursuant to OCGA § 38-3-62 and citing the public\\n      health emergency presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, Supreme\\n      Court of Georgia Chief Justice Harold Melton issued an order declaring\\n      a statewide judicial emergency. Among other things, the judicial\\n      emergency declaration suspended, tolled, extended and otherwise\\n      granted relief from any deadlines or time schedules in civil and criminal\\n      cases.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            3\\n Copeland v. Copeland, \\n361 Ga. App. 125\\n, 127, n. 3 (\\n863 SE2d 509\\n) (2021). The COVID-\\n\\n19 judicial emergency orders were subsequently extended several times.1\\n\\n      On July 10, 2020, our Supreme Court issued its Fourth Order Extending\\n\\nDeclaration of Statewide Judicial Emergency. The Fourth Order stated that, effective\\n\\nJuly 14, 2020, “all deadlines and other time schedules and filing requirements . . . that\\n\\nhave been suspended, tolled, extended, or otherwise relieved by the March 14, 2020\\n\\nOrder” would be reimposed, with certain exceptions and conditions, and that “[t]he\\n\\n122 days between March 14 and July 14, 2020, or any portion of that period in which\\n\\na statute of limitation would have run, shall be excluded from the calculation of that\\n\\nstatute of limitation.” Importantly, however, the Fourth Order also stated that\\n\\n“[u]ntil grand jury proceedings are generally authorized, statutes of limitation in\\n\\ncriminal cases shall also remain tolled.” Our Supreme Court extended the COVID-19\\n\\njudicial emergency orders a total of fifteen times, the last of which ended the judicial\\n\\nemergency as of June 30, 2021. In its 15th Order, our Supreme Court indicated that\\n\\nthe “[u]ntil this Order expires, all Georgia courts shall continue to operate under the\\n\\nrequirements set forth in the Order as extended.” Although “[s]tatutes of limitation\\n\\n      1\\n         The Chief Justice’s Orders are available                                     at\\nhttps://www.gasupreme.us/court-information/court_corona_info/.\\n                                           4\\n in criminal cases also remain tolled,” the Court noted that “when this statewide\\n\\njudicial emergency order expires, all deadlines not already reimposed will immediately\\n\\nbe reimposed (unless tolled by an applicable local judical emergency order).”\\n\\n      Accordingly, although the statute of limitation for misdemeanor offenses is\\n\\ngenerally two years, see OCGA § 17-3-1, the COVID-19 Emergency Orders tolled the\\n\\nstatute of limitation in criminal cases from March 14, 2020, until June 30, 2021.\\n\\nBecause the two year statute of limitation in Jones’ case did not expire until after the\\n\\naccusations were filed against her on March 21, 2023, the trial court erred in\\n\\ndismissing the case against her.

PLATT v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n        Rodrigues Platt 1 appeals his convictions related to the shooting\\n\\ndeath of David Jones, Jr. 2 On appeal, Platt argues that the trial\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 Platt’s first name is spelled “Rodriguez” in some court filings and in his\\n\\nbrief, but most of the court filings below use “Rodrigues.”\\n       2 The crimes occurred on June 16, 2009. In February 2010, a Liberty\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Platt, Jedediah Duncan, and Steven Bond for\\nmalice murder, felony murder predicated on aggravated assault, aggravated\\nassault, armed robbery, burglary, and possession of a firearm during the\\ncommission of a crime. The court severed the co-defendants’ trials, and the\\nrecord does not show the status of those cases. A jury found Platt guilty on all\\ncounts at an August 2011 trial, and the trial court sentenced him to life in\\nprison for malice murder, two concurrent twenty-year terms for armed robbery\\nand burglary, and a consecutive five-year term for the firearms offense. The\\nother counts were merged or vacated by operation of law. Platt filed a motion\\nfor new trial in August 2011 and amended it in 2019. The trial court denied\\nthe motion in September 2023. Platt timely filed a notice of appeal, and the\\ncase was docketed to this Court’s term beginning in December 2023 and\\nsubmitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n       The record does not reveal why it took well over a decade to resolve\\nPlatt’s motion for new trial. Platt asserts no claim about the post-conviction\\ndelay, but we nevertheless remind trial courts and attorneys of their duty\\ndiligently and efficiently to resolve pending motions for new trial.\\n court should have granted a mistrial due to the State’s failure to\\n\\ndisclose the inconclusive test results of a hair sample from a critical\\n\\nwitness against him who was also a possible suspect in the timely\\n\\nmanner required by OCGA § 17-6-4 and Brady v. Maryland, \\n373\\n\\nU.S. 83\\n (83 SCt 1194, 10LE2d 215) (1963). He also argues that the\\n\\ncourt should have granted a mistrial based on the State’s belated\\n\\ndisclosure that Platt’s initial custodial interview had been recorded\\n\\ndespite previously representing otherwise. Platt also argues that the\\n\\ntrial court should have taken some curative action when the\\n\\nprosecutor improperly identified him for testifying witnesses, and\\n\\nthat the cumulative prejudice of these errors warrants a new trial.\\n\\nWe conclude that Platt has failed to establish that a mistrial was\\n\\nnecessary to preserve his right to a fair trial, that any curative\\n\\naction was necessary based on the prosecutor’s identification of him,\\n\\nor that any errors cumulatively prejudiced him. Therefore, we\\n\\naffirm.\\n\\n      The evidence at trial showed the following. Jones lived in the\\n\\nTapco Mobile Home Park in Liberty County. He sold drugs and kept\\n\\n                                  2\\n his money in a small, black travel safe. On June 16, 2009, Jones was\\n\\nshot multiple times in his mobile home, leading to his death. Jarius\\n\\nWilson lived in a mobile home close to the victim’s and heard a noise\\n\\non the day of the shooting that sounded like firecrackers. After he\\n\\nheard the sound, Wilson looked out his window and saw “some guys”\\n\\nwearing masks running from the victim’s home and toward a\\n\\n“grayish-greenish” SUV.\\n\\n     Monique Hendry, Platt’s sister, testified that on the day of\\n\\nJones’s death, Platt, Steven Bond, and Jedediah Duncan were at\\n\\nHendry’s mother’s house. Bond and Duncan were wearing\\n\\ncamouflage, had gas masks, and were playing with a black gun. The\\n\\nthree men left in a “goldish” SUV driven by Duncan.\\n\\n     Miriam Brown testified that on the day of the shooting, Duncan\\n\\npicked her up and drove her to Hinesville, driving a tan or gold SUV.\\n\\nBond was also in the vehicle, and the two men were wearing army\\n\\nfatigues, jeans, and black shirts. On the drive to Hinesville, Bond\\n\\nand Duncan showed her a gas mask and a bulletproof vest, and\\n\\nDuncan passed a black gun to Bond. Duncan and Bond dropped off\\n\\n                                 3\\n Brown. When they picked her up later that day, she heard one of\\n\\nthem say, “I can’t believe it,” that they had killed someone, and that\\n\\nthey had shot “him” three times because “he had seen his face.”\\n\\nDuncan and Bond said that they had gone to the victim’s house to\\n\\n“kick in the door” and that they took a safe that was full of “eight\\n\\nballs,” which Brown said meant crack cocaine.\\n\\n     Bruce Coleman testified that he was at Tapco on the morning\\n\\nof the shooting and went to the store with Duncan and Bond in\\n\\nDuncan’s gold SUV. Before dropping Coleman off at the Pineland\\n\\nApartment complex where Coleman’s girlfriend lived, Duncan and\\n\\nBond talked about “a lick,” which Coleman described as a robbery,\\n\\nand Coleman declined their invitation to join them. Later that day,\\n\\nColeman saw Duncan drop off Platt and Bond at Pineland. Bond\\n\\nsaid they had robbed and shot someone, possibly killing the victim.\\n\\nColeman did not believe Bond, so he went to ask Platt, who had\\n\\nwalked away. Platt said that “they” probably had killed “him” and\\n\\nshowed Coleman a gun that Platt said was used during the robbery.\\n\\n     Steve Plair, Bond’s older brother who also lived at Tapco at the\\n\\n                                  4\\n time of the shooting, said that on the morning of the shooting,\\n\\nDuncan and Bond were outside the mobile home discussing robbing\\n\\nsomeone. Plair said that Platt, Bond, and Duncan were at his mobile\\n\\nhome later that night, and Platt had a revolver. Plair testified that\\n\\nthe three men left, and 35 to 45 minutes later, Plair heard gunshots.\\n\\nPlair saw Platt a few days later, and Platt admitted to shooting\\n\\nsomeone called “Little Dave.” Platt said that when he was in the\\n\\nvictim’s mobile home, Platt’s face covering slipped, so he guessed the\\n\\nvictim saw him. Platt said he shot the victim three times, while\\n\\nDuncan retrieved the safe. Plair admitted that on the night of the\\n\\nshooting, he hid from police but later turned himself in. Plair was\\n\\narrested because someone identified him as being involved in the\\n\\nshooting, but he denied being involved and said he knew nothing.\\n\\nPlair later told police about Platt’s statements, admitting that he\\n\\ndid so only after being charged with murder in this case — charges\\n\\nthat were ultimately dismissed.\\n\\n     During the investigation, Duncan led police to a field where\\n\\nthey found, among other things, a stocking cap that had hairs inside,\\n\\n                                  5\\n a camouflage shirt and pants, a gas mask, and a safe that had “3A2”\\n\\nwritten on it. The same inscription — “3A2” — was also written on\\n\\na key found in the victim’s pocket. Police also found one 9mm shell\\n\\ncasing at the bottom of the steps to the victim’s mobile home and\\n\\nanother in Duncan’s vehicle, and a firearms expert testified that\\n\\nthey were fired from the same weapon.\\n\\n     Platt was interviewed by police on two different days. During\\n\\nthe second interview, which was recorded and played for the jury at\\n\\ntrial, Platt admitted participating in the armed robbery and that\\n\\nJones was shot during the crime. He denied shooting Jones. Platt,\\n\\nDuncan, and Bond were charged with several crimes, and following\\n\\na jury trial, Platt was convicted of malice murder, armed robbery,\\n\\nburglary, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\ncrime.\\n\\n     1.   Platt argues that the trial court should have granted a\\n\\nmistrial based on the State’s untimely disclosure that it had\\n\\ncompared the hairs found in the recovered stocking cap against\\n\\nPlair’s hair and found the results inconclusive. We disagree.\\n\\n                                 6\\n      Platt filed a pretrial discovery motion, requesting, among other\\n\\nthings, the results of all scientific tests and all Brady material. Two\\n\\nweeks before trial, defense counsel met with the prosecutor, the lead\\n\\ninvestigator Detective Snider, and other police officers, to review\\n\\nevery exhibit the State intended to introduce at trial. The State did\\n\\nnot at that time disclose to Platt that it had tested Plair’s hair with\\n\\ninconclusive results.\\n\\n     During opening statements, Platt’s counsel told the jury that,\\n\\nalthough the State had compared the hair recovered from the\\n\\nstocking cap to the defendants in the case and did not find a match,\\n\\nthe State never compared those hairs to hair samples from Plair. In\\n\\nfact, that was not true: unbeknownst to trial counsel, the State had\\n\\nmade that comparison, although the results were inconclusive. After\\n\\nopening statements and during a recess, the State disclosed to Platt\\n\\nfor the first time that it had tested Plair’s hair with inconclusive\\n\\nresults. Platt moved for a mistrial and called Detective Snider in\\n\\nsupport of that motion. Detective Snider testified that a few weeks\\n\\nbefore trial, he talked to the GBI agent who conducted the test on\\n\\n                                  7\\n Plair’s hair, and was told that the initial comparison was\\n\\n“tentatively” inconclusive, the agent would prepare a final report\\n\\nafter peer review, and the agent would submit samples for DNA\\n\\ntesting, which Detective Snider understood to mean that the agent\\n\\nhad only looked at the hair samples under a microscope. Detective\\n\\nSnider confirmed that, although testing results for Platt and other\\n\\ndefendants were provided to Platt as part of discovery, no\\n\\ninformation about the testing of Plair’s hair was provided. Detective\\n\\nSnider said he had not talked to the GBI agent since being informed\\n\\nof the inconclusive results.\\n\\n     The court denied the mistrial motion, concluding that the\\n\\nresults did not “help or hurt either side.” The court allowed Platt’s\\n\\ncounsel to reopen opening statements. Counsel told the jury that he\\n\\nmade a misstatement about Plair’s hair never having been tested\\n\\nand this was caused by the State’s failure to disclose this\\n\\ninformation. Counsel insisted that the State was “hiding evidence,”\\n\\nthat he had been subjected to “trial by ambush,” that he had been\\n\\nunable to prepare the defense adequately or conduct independent\\n\\n                                 8\\n testing of the hair given the last-minute disclosure, and that this\\n\\nwas “all the reasonable doubt” the jury needed.\\n\\n     On appeal, Platt argues that the untimely disclosure impaired\\n\\nhis defense and that a mistrial was therefore warranted. A trial\\n\\ncourt is vested with broad discretion as to whether to grant a\\n\\nmistrial, and a court’s decision not to grant one will not be disturbed\\n\\non appeal unless there is a showing that a mistrial was essential to\\n\\npreserve a party’s right to a fair trial. See Jordan v. State, \\n305 Ga.\\n\\n12\\n, 15 (2) (\\n823 SE2d 336\\n) (2019); Ragan v. State, \\n299 Ga. 828\\n, 833-\\n\\n834 (3) (\\n792 SE2d 342\\n) (2016).\\n\\n     Platt argues primarily that a mistrial was necessary to remedy\\n\\nthe State’s violation of Brady. Under Brady,\\n\\n     the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable\\n     to an accused upon request violates due process where the\\n     evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\\n     irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\\n     prosecution. This includes the suppression of\\n     impeachment evidence that may be used to challenge the\\n     credibility of a witness.\\n\\nHood v. State, \\n311 Ga. 855\\n, 863 (1) (\\n860 SE2d 432\\n) (2021) (citations\\n\\nand punctuation omitted); see also Chavez v. State, \\n307 Ga. 804\\n, 813\\n\\n                                  9\\n (3) (\\n837 SE2d 766\\n) (2020) (to be entitled to a new trial, a defendant\\n\\nmust show that the evidence is “material to his guilt or punishment”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)). Evidence is “material” in this\\n\\ncontext when “there is a reasonable probability that, had the\\n\\nevidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have\\n\\nbeen different. A ‘reasonable probability’ of a different result is one\\n\\nin which the suppressed evidence undermines confidence in the\\n\\noutcome of the trial.” Chavez, 307 Ga. at 813 (3) (citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). “In the case of an untimely disclosure, a\\n\\ndefendant must show that an earlier disclosure would have\\n\\nbenefited the defense and that the delayed disclosure deprived him\\n\\nof a fair trial.” Anglin v. State, \\n312 Ga. 503\\n, 510 (2) (b) (\\n863 SE2d\\n\\n148\\n) (2021) (citation and punctuation omitted). Platt has failed to\\n\\nmake this showing.\\n\\n     Platt first argues that the untimely disclosure affected his\\n\\nopening statement, and that the entire defense, as reflected by the\\n\\nopening statement, became “unsupported” by the late disclosure.\\n\\nAlthough the untimely disclosure undermined his statement about\\n\\n                                  10\\n a lack of testing, Platt was able to argue to the jury that the State\\n\\nwas “hiding evidence,” creating doubt as to the thoroughness of the\\n\\nState’s investigation.\\n\\n     Platt also argues that the untimely disclosure hampered his\\n\\ndefense, but he does not show how he would have altered his defense\\n\\nif given the information sooner. Platt claims that he could have\\n\\nprocured independent DNA testing of the hair had he been made\\n\\naware of the inconclusive results sooner, and that he could have used\\n\\nthis information to impeach Plair and establish his motive for saying\\n\\nthat Platt confessed to him that Platt shot Jones. Platt’s arguments\\n\\nare meritless. Platt knew about the hair recovered from the stocking\\n\\ncap. Although he thought the hair had not been compared to Plair’s\\n\\nhair, as reflected by his initial opening statement, there is no\\n\\nevidence in the record that he ever sought to secure independent\\n\\nDNA testing of the recovered hair prior to trial. And Platt’s claim\\n\\nabout what the DNA testing would reveal is purely speculative, as\\n\\nthere is no evidence of such testing. Platt argues in his appellate\\n\\nbrief that “[i]t could have been [Plair’s] hair in the stocking cap[,]”\\n\\n                                  11\\n but further testing could have alternatively revealed that the hair\\n\\nbelonged to Platt. In any case, whatever the results of DNA testing\\n\\nwould have revealed, Platt has not shown that any further\\n\\nimpeachment of Plair would have made a meaningful difference.\\n\\nMoreover, Platt was able to impeach Plair about his motive for\\n\\nsaying that Platt confessed to the crime, suggesting that Plair\\n\\nnamed Platt only after Plair himself was charged in the case. See\\n\\nHood v. State, \\n311 Ga. 855\\n, 864-865 (1) (\\n860 SE2d 432\\n) (2021)\\n\\n(although full scope of witness’s “possible incentives to cooperate\\n\\nwith the State was not made known to the jury, the jury was\\n\\nnonetheless aware there was reason to regard his testimony with\\n\\nskepticism[,]” and witness’s testimony was largely cumulative of\\n\\nother evidence, so defendant was unable to establish materiality).\\n\\nBecause Platt has shown only a mere possibility that additional\\n\\ntesting would have been favorable to his defense, he has failed to\\n\\nshow a Brady violation. See Mitchell v. State, \\n307 Ga. 855\\n, 862 (2)\\n\\n(b) (\\n838 SE2d 847\\n) (2020) (rejecting Brady claim as not establishing\\n\\nmateriality because defendant offered no evidence in support of his\\n\\n                                12\\n speculation that had he been provided with information about\\n\\nfingerprints lifted from a taxi where the victim was found dead, he\\n\\ncould have procured independent testing that would have helped his\\n\\ndefense).\\n\\n     Platt also argues that the State’s failure to disclose the\\n\\ninconclusive results violated statutory disclosure rules. Specifically,\\n\\nPlatt argues that the State violated OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (4) by failing\\n\\nto reduce to writing the GBI agent’s oral report and failing to provide\\n\\nhim with a copy of the same. By its terms, however, the statute\\n\\nimposes a duty on the State to provide the results of scientific\\n\\ntesting, including if a report is “oral or partially oral,” only “if the\\n\\nstate intends to introduce [the results of the testing] in evidence in\\n\\nits case-in-chief or in rebuttal[.]” See OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (4). 3 There\\n\\n\\n     3 The subparagraph provides:\\n\\n\\n\\n     The prosecuting attorney shall, no later than ten days prior to\\n     trial, or as otherwise ordered by the court, permit the defendant at\\n     a time agreed to by the parties or ordered by the court to inspect\\n     and copy or photograph a report of any physical or mental\\n     examinations and of scientific tests or experiments, including a\\n     summary of the basis for the expert opinion rendered in the report,\\n     or copies thereof, if the state intends to introduce in evidence in its\\n\\n                                       13\\n was no indication that the State intended to introduce into evidence\\n\\nthe “inconclusive results” of the testing of Plair’s hair, so Platt has\\n\\nfailed to demonstrate a violation of OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (4). Because\\n\\nthe untimely disclosure did not violate Brady or OCGA § 17-16-4 (a)\\n\\n(4), Platt’s claim that the trial court erred in failing to remedy such\\n\\nviolations necessarily fails.\\n\\n     2.    Platt argues that the trial court should have also granted\\n\\na mistrial, or at least a continuance, due to the State’s untimely\\n\\ndisclosure that Platt’s first custodial interview had been recorded\\n\\nwhen it had previously represented otherwise. We disagree.\\n\\n     At a Jackson-Denno 4 hearing before trial, the investigator who\\n\\nhad interviewed Platt, Detective Howard, testified that he\\n\\n\\n\\n     case-in-chief or in rebuttal the results of the physical or mental\\n     examination or scientific test or experiment. If the report is oral or\\n     partially oral, the prosecuting attorney shall reduce all relevant\\n     and material oral portions of such report to writing and shall serve\\n     opposing counsel with such portions no later than ten days prior to\\n     trial. Nothing in this Code section shall require the disclosure of\\n     any other material, note, or memorandum relating to the\\n     psychiatric or psychological treatment or therapy of any victim or\\n     witness.\\n\\nOCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (4) (emphasis added).\\n    4 Jackson v. Denno, \\n378 U.S. 368\\n (84 SCt 1774, 12 LE2d 908) (1964).\\n\\n                                      14\\n interviewed Platt on two different days, the second interview a full\\n\\nday after the first. Detective Howard testified that although he\\n\\nproposed recording the first interview, he did not actually do so. He\\n\\ntestified that the second interview was recorded and that Platt’s\\n\\nstatements during the first interview were consistent with those\\n\\ngiven at the second interview.\\n\\n     Apparently based on this testimony, Platt argued during\\n\\nopening statements that the jury was not going to hear what\\n\\nhappened during the first interview because it was not recorded; the\\n\\njury would hear only what a police officer says happened; and the\\n\\njury would hear only Platt’s statements that were recorded after he\\n\\nhad spent a night in a jail where the victim’s father worked, which\\n\\nwould have instilled fear into Platt.\\n\\n     During the lunch break on the second day of the trial, the State\\n\\ninformed defense counsel that Platt’s first interview had, in fact,\\n\\nbeen recorded. Defense counsel listened to the recording once over\\n\\nthe lunch break and asked for a mistrial because the “new evidence\\n\\n. . . contradicts a good bit of what I’ve been saying and the way I’ve\\n\\n                                  15\\n tailored the defense in this — you know, during this trial for the past\\n\\nday and a half.” Defense counsel alternatively asked for a\\n\\ncontinuance “at least for the rest of the day” to allow counsel to\\n\\nreview the recording more thoroughly and incorporate the evidence\\n\\ninto Platt’s defense.\\n\\n     The prosecutor stated that she did not know about the\\n\\nrecording until the second day of trial when Detective Howard\\n\\nmentioned it during a conversation; the prosecutor said she\\n\\nimmediately let defense counsel know and suggested as a remedy\\n\\nthat the recording not be played. Defense counsel noted in response\\n\\nthat Platt’s statements were not the same during the two interviews,\\n\\nas he did not inculpate himself in the first interview. Defense\\n\\ncounsel later observed that this was the second piece of evidence\\n\\nthat was not timely disclosed. In response, the prosecutor said she\\n\\ndid not want to “start all over again. But if the Court feels that’s the\\n\\nthing to do out of fairness, the State’s really not . . . .” The trial court\\n\\ndenied the motion before the prosecutor finished her statement.\\n\\n     Responding to the continuance request, the prosecutor did not\\n\\n                                    16\\n object to giving defense counsel the rest of the day to review the\\n\\nrecording, but preferred to break for just three hours because the\\n\\nprosecutor had planned to call a witness who was travelling that day\\n\\nand wanted to get her “in and out.” The court asked if the jury\\n\\nshould hear “the truth about all this,” and defense counsel said, “we\\n\\nhave to . . . I don’t see how we can’t tell them, you know, that there’s\\n\\ntwo pieces of evidence.” After confirming that counsel had listened\\n\\nto the recording, the trial court denied a continuance.\\n\\n     The recordings of both interviews were ultimately played for\\n\\nthe jury during Detective Howard’s testimony. As captured in the\\n\\nrecording of the first interview, Platt admitted to being in Tapco\\n\\nduring the robbery and seeing parts of it from a nearby mobile home,\\n\\nbut he denied being involved or knowing who shot Jones. During\\n\\ncross-examination, Platt elicited testimony that Detective Howard\\n\\nhad previously testified at the Jackson-Denno hearing that Platt\\n\\nnever denied being involved in the robbery.\\n\\n     Platt argues on appeal that the State’s failure to advise him\\n\\nthat his first interview was recorded and provide him a copy of that\\n\\n                                  17\\n recording violated OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (1), and that a mistrial was\\n\\nwarranted under the remedies available under OCGA § 17-16-6\\n\\nbecause he showed that the State acted in bad faith and he was\\n\\nprejudiced as a result. For its part, the State does not dispute that\\n\\nit violated OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (1) by failing to advise Platt that the\\n\\nfirst interview was recorded and allow him to inspect or copy it in\\n\\nadvance of trial. Instead, the State argues that the trial court’s\\n\\nremedial actions were adequate under OCGA § 17-16-6.\\n\\n     As stated above, a trial court has broad discretion to grant or\\n\\ndeny a mistrial. This discretion also applies to whether to grant a\\n\\nmistrial as a remedy under OCGA § 17-16-6. See Tubbs v. State, \\n276\\n\\nGa. 751\\n, 753-754 (3) (\\n583 SE2d 853\\n) (2003). A court also has the\\n\\ndiscretion to grant a continuance as a remedy for a violation of\\n\\nOCGA § 17-16-6. Id. at 753-753 (2), (3). As explained above, we will\\n\\nnot overturn a trial court’s decision to deny a mistrial unless a\\n\\nmistrial was essential to preserve the right to a fair trial. And to\\n\\nobtain a new trial from the improper denial of a continuance request,\\n\\na defendant must show harm. See Harris v. State, \\n309 Ga. 599\\n, 609\\n\\n                                 18\\n (3) (\\n847 SE2d 563\\n) (2020). Platt has failed to make these showings.\\n\\n     (i)      A mistrial was not essential to preserve Platt’s right to\\n     a fair trial.\\n\\n     Platt argues that he was prejudiced by the late disclosure\\n\\nbecause he had referenced the fact that the first interview was not\\n\\nrecorded in his opening statement. But Platt does not show how the\\n\\nlate disclosure harmed him.\\n\\n     He first argues that he was prejudiced because he referred to\\n\\nthe first interview in his opening statement and it formed the basis\\n\\nof his defense. But he referred to that interview to suggest that he\\n\\ndid not initially admit participating in the crime and made his\\n\\nadmission during the second interview only as a result of fear after\\n\\nspending a night in jail. The recording of that first interview only\\n\\nbolstered this argument. In that recording, Platt admits to being in\\n\\nTapco during the robbery and knowing about it, but he denied being\\n\\ninvolved or knowing who shot Jones. The recording thus supported,\\n\\nrather than undermined, Platt’s opening statement where he\\n\\nsuggested that his confession in the second interview was not\\n\\n\\n                                  19\\n truthful.\\n\\n      Platt next argues that he was prejudiced because Detective\\n\\nHoward testified at the motions hearing that Platt’s statements in\\n\\nthe two interviews were consistent. But Platt was able to use the\\n\\nrecording to impeach Detective Howard’s credibility by showing that\\n\\nDetective Howard’s prior testimony was not accurate, and he has\\n\\nnot shown how an earlier disclosure would have made any difference\\n\\nin this respect.\\n\\n      Platt also argues that he was prejudiced by the untimely\\n\\ndisclosure because he had to question three of the State’s most\\n\\nimportant witnesses without a “correct” version of events as relayed\\n\\nin the first interview. But this claim is vague and unsupported. Platt\\n\\ndoes not identify which witnesses he considers to be “most\\n\\nimportant.” But more importantly, he does he show how he would\\n\\nhave examined these witnesses differently had the recording been\\n\\ndisclosed sooner.5\\n\\n\\n      5 In one part of his brief, Platt notes that the State called five witnesses\\n\\nafter lunch (after he listened to the recording), lists four witnesses (“Detective\\n\\n                                       20\\n       Platt contends that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s\\n\\nfailure to “remedy the situation with the jury” despite having\\n\\n“promised” to do so.6 In support of this argument, Platt relies on Lee\\n\\nv. State, \\n306 Ga. 663\\n (\\n832 SE2d 851\\n) (2019), where this Court stated\\n\\nthat a trial court acts within its discretion to deny a motion for\\n\\nmistrial “when it provides adequate curative instructions to the jury\\n\\nto cure any prejudice stemming from the introduction of the\\n\\nimproper evidence.” Id. at 669. But as already made clear, Platt has\\n\\ndemonstrated no prejudice resulting from the late disclosure of the\\n\\nrecording; instead, the recording seemed to help his defense and he\\n\\nhas not shown any harm from the delayed disclosure.\\n\\n      Platt next relies on the State’s apparent lack of opposition to a\\n\\nmistrial as evidence that the trial court should have granted one.\\n\\n\\n\\nSnider, a GBI crime lab tools examiner, Plair, and Detective Howard”), and\\nthen states “the newly-disclosed recording impacted all three.” Even assuming\\nPlatt was referring to Detective Snider, Detective Howard, and Plair as the\\n“three most important” witnesses, he does not explain what line of questioning\\nhe would have pursued had he known about the recording sooner. And as\\ndiscussed, he was able to use the recording to impeach Detective Howard.\\n       6 In his brief, Platt cites the trial court’s question about whether it should\\n\\ntell the jury the “truth” about the recording, but there is nothing in this\\nexchange to show that it promised some sort of curative instruction.\\n                                         21\\n Platt seems to focus on the prosecutor’s response to whether it\\n\\nrequested the court deny the motion for mistrial. The prosecutor did\\n\\nnot finish her sentence before the trial court denied the motion, so it\\n\\nis not entirely clear what position the prosecutor was taking. But\\n\\neven if the prosecutor’s statement is read as an apparent lack of\\n\\nobjection, this does not establish that a mistrial was necessary. At\\n\\nmost, the prosecutor’s statements show her acknowledgement of the\\n\\nfact that the court could grant a mistrial; those statements fell short\\n\\nof showing that the court was required to grant one. See Hightower\\n\\nv. State, \\n315 Ga. 399\\n, 404 (2) (\\n883 SE2d 335\\n) (2023) (simply because\\n\\n“reasonable” minds may differ about whether other alternatives are\\n\\nproper is not dispositive of whether a trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nin deciding whether to grant a mistrial). We conclude that Platt has\\n\\nfailed to show that a mistrial was necessary to preserve his right to\\n\\na fair trial.\\n\\n      (ii)    Even if the court abused its discretion in denying Platt\\n      a continuance, he has not shown harm to warrant a new trial.\\n\\n      Platt alternatively argues that the trial court should have at\\n\\n\\n                                  22\\n least granted his unopposed request for a continuance. But even if\\n\\nthe trial court abused its discretion in denying that request, Platt\\n\\ncannot obtain a new trial unless he shows harm. See Harris v. State,\\n\\n309 Ga. 599\\n, 609 (3) (\\n847 SE2d 563\\n) (2020). Platt argues that he\\n\\nneeded more time to study the recording and prepare, but he makes\\n\\nno showing how additional time would have benefitted him. See\\n\\nPhoenix v. State, \\n304 Ga. 785\\n, 789 (2) (\\n822 SE2d 195\\n) (2018) (“To\\n\\nshow harm, a party is required to specifically identify what other\\n\\nevidence or witnesses he would have put forth in his defense if his\\n\\ncounsel had been given more time to prepare; speculation and\\n\\nconjecture are not enough.” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\nMoreover, as discussed above, Platt demonstrated no prejudice from\\n\\nthe untimely disclosure of the recording, as the recording seemed to\\n\\nhelp, rather than harm, Platt’s defense. Because Platt has failed to\\n\\nshow how any additional time to prepare harmed him, this\\n\\nargument fails. 7\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 Although the claims of untimely disclosure do not warrant reversal, we\\n\\ndo not condone the State’s failure to comply with its legal obligations.\\n                                       23\\n      3.   Platt argues that the prosecutor violated OCGA § 17-8-75\\n\\nby “identifying” him for three witnesses, and the trial court erred by\\n\\nfailing to take some curative action. From a review of the record, it\\n\\nappears that the witnesses had an obstructed view of the defense\\n\\ntable where Platt was sitting, and the prosecutor attempted to point\\n\\nout Platt’s location in the courtroom. The prosecutor did nothing\\n\\nmore than say where Platt was located.\\n\\n     OCGA § 17-8-75 provides:\\n\\n     Where counsel in the hearing of the jury make statements\\n     of prejudicial matters which are not in evidence, it is the\\n     duty of the court to interpose and prevent the same. On\\n     objection made, the court shall also rebuke the counsel\\n     and by all needful and proper instructions to the jury\\n     endeavor to remove the improper impression from their\\n     minds; or, in his discretion, he may order a mistrial if the\\n     prosecuting attorney is the offender.\\n\\n     We are dubious that the prosecutor’s actions were “statements\\n\\nof prejudicial matters” triggering a requirement for the trial court to\\n\\ntake curative action under OCGA § 17-8-75. The jury was no doubt\\n\\nwell aware that Platt was on trial and was sitting at the defense\\n\\ntable. There is no indication that the prosecutor did anything more\\n\\n\\n                                  24\\n than to make sure witnesses knew where Platt was.\\n\\n     But even if this amounted to a violation of OCGA § 17-8-75,\\n\\nany error in failing to prevent the prosecutor from making continued\\n\\n“identifications” of Platt or issuing a curative instruction was\\n\\nharmless.\\n\\n     [A] trial court’s error in not fulfilling its duty under OCGA\\n     § 17-8-75 is subject to harmless error analysis. For\\n     nonconstitutional harmless error, the State has the\\n     burden to show that it was highly probable that the error\\n     did not contribute to the verdict.\\n\\nCaldwell v. State, \\n313 Ga. 640\\n, 648 (2) (\\n872 SE2d 712\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, any error was harmless given the strong evidence of\\n\\nPlatt’s guilt. Even setting aside Platt’s second recorded interview in\\n\\nwhich he admitted participating in the armed robbery, other\\n\\nevidence showed that Platt shot Jones or, at the very least,\\n\\nparticipated in the armed robbery. Plair testified that Platt said he\\n\\nshot the victim during a robbery when Platt’s face covering fell off\\n\\nand allowed him to see Platt. Bruce Coleman also heard Duncan and\\n\\nBond talk on the day of the shooting about a planning a “lick,” or\\n\\n                                  25\\n robbery, and when he saw them afterward, he heard from Platt and\\n\\nBond that they carried out the robbery and “probably” killed\\n\\nsomeone. Miriam Brown and Platt’s sister testified that on the day\\n\\nof the shooting, Platt, Duncan, Bond, and Plair were playing with a\\n\\ngun and wearing clothing that was later recovered from the same\\n\\nfield where a safe appearing to belong to the victim was also found.\\n\\nGiven the strength of the evidence, and the jury’s awareness that\\n\\nPlatt was on trial and was sitting at the defense table, it is highly\\n\\nprobable that the prosecutor’s actions in pointing out Platt as the\\n\\ndefendant to witnesses did not contribute to the jury’s verdict.\\n\\n     4.   Platt next argues that the cumulative prejudice from the\\n\\ntrial court’s errors warranted a new trial. We disagree.\\n\\n     To establish cumulative error, Platt must establish that “at\\n\\nleast two errors were committed in the course of the trial and\\n\\nconsidered together along with the entire record, the multiple errors\\n\\nso infected the jury’s deliberation that they denied [him] a\\n\\nfundamentally fair trial.” Huff v. State, \\n315 Ga. 558\\n, 567-568 (6) (\\n883\\n\\nSE2d 773\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). Above, we\\n\\n                                  26\\n assume, without deciding, that the trial court may have erred in\\n\\nfailing to grant Platt a continuance related to the State’s untimely\\n\\ndisclosure that Platt’s first custodial interview had been recorded\\n\\nand in failing to take some curative action with respect to the\\n\\nprosecutor’s identification of Platt to witnesses. As explained above,\\n\\nthese errors produced very little, if any, harm. Therefore, given the\\n\\nstrength of the evidence, even if these assumed errors could be\\n\\nconsidered cumulatively, the cumulative prejudice did not deny\\n\\nPlatt a fair trial.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

CITY OF WINDER v. BARROW COUNTY.\\n\\n\\n        MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n        This case addresses three issues of first impression involving\\n\\nthe interpretation and application of the Services Delivery Strategy\\n\\n(“SDS”) Act (the “Act”), OCGA § 36-70-20 et seq.,1 in connection with\\n\\ndisputes between the City of Winder (the “City”) and Barrow County\\n\\n(the “County”) about the delivery of services to County and City\\n\\nresidents and property owners and how those services are to be\\n\\nfunded.2 As we explain below, we conclude that whether the\\n\\n\\n        1 OCGA § 36-70-20 explains that the Act is intended “to provide a flexible\\n\\nframework within which local governments in each county can develop a\\nservice delivery system that is both efficient and responsive to citizens in their\\ncounty;” “to minimize inefficiencies resulting from duplication of services and\\ncompetition between local governments[;] and to provide a mechanism to\\nresolve disputes over local government service delivery, funding equity, and\\nland use.”\\n      2 The Court thanks the Georgia Municipal Association, Inc.; the Cities of\\n\\nStockbridge and Valdosta; the Association County Commissioners of Georgia\\n maintenance of county roads primarily benefits the unincorporated\\n\\narea of a county requires consideration of the totality of the\\n\\ncircumstances involved and cannot be resolved as a matter of law;\\n\\nthat services that primarily benefit the unincorporated area of the\\n\\ncounty must be funded through the mechanisms delineated in the\\n\\nAct; and that the proceeding set out in the Act for resolution of SDS\\n\\ndisputes does not permit the County to challenge whether water\\n\\nrates charged by the City are an illegal tax and whether the City\\n\\nmay transfer profits from providing water service into its general\\n\\nfund.\\n\\n     In 1999, Barrow County and the municipalities located within\\n\\nthe County—the cities of Winder, Auburn, and Statham and the\\n\\ntowns of Bethlehem, Braselton, and Carl—entered into a\\n\\ncomprehensive SDS Agreement for the provision of a number of\\n\\nservices to County and municipal residents and property owners\\n\\n\\n\\n(“ACCG”); and Bulloch, Cherokee, Dawson, Forsyth, Greene, Gwinnett, Henry,\\nLowndes, Lumpkin, Newton, Rabun, Screven, and Walker Counties for their\\namici curiae briefs, which greatly assisted us in our consideration of these\\nimportant questions of Georgia law. This case was orally argued before this\\nCourt on October 17, 2023.\\n                                     2\\n including road maintenance and water utility service. That\\n\\nAgreement was extended several times and was set to expire on\\n\\nFebruary 28, 2019. In advance of that deadline and in an effort to\\n\\navoid sanctions under the Act,3 the parties attempted to come to a\\n\\nconsensus on a new SDS Agreement, but the negotiations between\\n\\nthe parties did not successfully resolve all of their issues. As a result,\\n\\nin 2018 and 2019, the County, City, and other municipalities within\\n\\nthe County participated in voluntary mediation under the Act. See\\n\\nOCGA § 36-70-25.1 (c).4 The parties were able to settle all but two of\\n\\nforty-one service issues in dispute through mediation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 Because the parties failed to agree to an updated SDS Agreement by\\n\\nthe February 28, 2019 deadline, sanctions under OCGA § 36-70-27 (a) were\\nimposed on the County and each municipality. However, after the County filed\\na petition seeking resolution of these issues, the superior court ordered that\\nthe sanctions be held in abeyance during the pendency of the litigation. See\\nOCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d) (2) (“It shall be in the discretion of the judge to hold the\\nsanctions specified in Code Section 36-70-27 against one or more of the parties\\nin abeyance pending the disposition of the action.”).\\n      4 OCGA § 36-70-25.1 (c) provides for the use of alternative dispute\\n\\nresolution, as follows:\\n      If a county and the affected municipalities in the county are unable\\n      to reach an agreement on the strategy prior to the imposition of\\n      the sanctions provided in Code Section 36-70-27, a means for\\n      facilitating an agreement through some form of alternative dispute\\n      resolution shall be employed.\\n                                        3\\n      To resolve the remaining conflicts, the County filed a three-\\n\\ncount petition pursuant to OCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d)5 seeking court-\\n\\nordered mediation and/or a judicial resolution of the disputes. The\\n\\npetition identified the remaining service issues as relating to (1) the\\n\\nfunding for the County’s road maintenance and (2) the water utility\\n\\nservice, including “(a) the arbitrariness of the water rate\\n\\ndifferentials charged by [the City] to customers located inside and\\n\\noutside of [the] city limits and (b) [the] County’s authority to provide\\n\\nwater service to all customers located in the unincorporated area of\\n\\nthe County.”\\n\\n     The County later amended its petition to add another count\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     5 OCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d) (1) (A) allows the parties to seek resolution of\\n\\ntheir disputes in superior court:\\n      In the event that the county and the affected municipalities in the\\n      county fail to reach an agreement after the imposition of sanctions\\n      provided in Code Section 36-70-27, then the following process is\\n      available to the parties: . . . [t]he county or any affected\\n      municipality located within the county may file a petition in [the]\\n      superior court of the county seeking mandatory mediation.\\nIf the court-ordered mediation does not resolve the disputes, “any aggrieved\\nparty may petition the superior court and seek resolution of the items\\nremaining in dispute. The . . . judge shall conduct an evidentiary hearing or\\nhearings as such judge deems necessary and render a decision with regard to\\nthe disputed items.” OCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d) (2).\\n                                     4\\n (“Count IV”) alleging that the City’s water service charges for\\n\\nresidents in unincorporated areas of the County or in another\\n\\nmunicipality (the “Outside Customers”) amounted to an illegal tax\\n\\non such residents based on the differential in the rates the City\\n\\ncharged its own residents and those it charged the Outside\\n\\nCustomers. Under the previous SDS Agreement between the County\\n\\nand the City, the City provided exclusive water service to an area\\n\\nthat included the City but also the Outside Customers. The County\\n\\nalleged that, between 2012 and 2017, the City overcharged the\\n\\nOutside Customers to generate a total of over $13 million in profit\\n\\nabove the actual cost of providing the service through what it\\n\\ncharacterized as arbitrary, excessive, and abusive water rates and\\n\\nthat the City transferred these profits to its general fund. The\\n\\nCounty also alleged that throughout the SDS mediation process, the\\n\\nCounty demanded that the City discontinue monetary transfers out\\n\\nof its water fund into the general fund. Count IV “requests that the\\n\\nCourt enter an order finding that the establishment of Outside\\n\\nCustomer water rates and fees at a level designed to generate a\\n\\n                                 5\\n profit from Outside Customers constitutes an illegal tax on Outside\\n\\nCustomers and that the City [] does not have the legal authority to\\n\\ntransfer profits collected from the sale of water to Outside\\n\\nCustomers out of its Water Fund and into its General Fund except\\n\\nto recover the cost of bona fide support provided to the Water Fund\\n\\nby other governmental funds.”\\n\\n     After the parties participated in court-ordered mediation,\\n\\nwhich again failed to resolve the outstanding service delivery issues,\\n\\nthey began to engage in discovery. Prior to the completion of that\\n\\nprocess, the County and the City filed cross-motions for partial\\n\\nsummary judgment on the legal issue of what standard should be\\n\\nused under OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A) 6 to determine whether\\n\\nresidents, individuals, and property owners of the incorporated\\n\\nareas of the County could be charged for the costs of road\\n\\nmaintenance for county roads located in unincorporated areas of the\\n\\n\\n     6 OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A) provides in relevant part: “The strategy shall\\n\\nensure that the cost of any service which a county provides primarily for the\\nbenefit of the unincorporated area of the county shall be borne by the\\nunincorporated area residents, individuals, and property owners who receive\\nthe service.”\\n                                     6\\n County. The City argued that under OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A), the\\n\\ngeographic location of the roads, which necessarily is where the\\n\\nmoney would be spent to perform maintenance on the roads\\n\\ndetermined which County residents, individuals, and property\\n\\nowners could be charged for the maintenance,7 while the County\\n\\nargued that road maintenance funding depended, instead, on who\\n\\nhad access to and used the roads. Thus, the County contended that\\n\\nmunicipal residents could also be charged for maintenance of county\\n\\nroads. The City later filed a second motion for partial summary\\n\\njudgment, contending that the County’s source of revenue to fund\\n\\nservices for the unincorporated areas was limited to the mechanisms\\n\\nspelled out in OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B): “property taxes, insurance\\n\\npremium taxes, assessments, or user fees.”8 In addition, the City\\n\\n\\n      7 The City contemporaneously moved to dismiss Count II of the petition,\\n\\nasserting that the County failed to fulfill the statutory requirements for\\nbringing such a claim, which the City contended should have been brought in\\na separate proceeding. The superior court denied that motion, but the City does\\nnot appeal that ruling.\\n      8 Under OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B),\\n\\n      [s]uch funding shall be derived from special service districts\\n      created by the county in which property taxes, insurance premium\\n      taxes, assessments, or user fees are levied or imposed or through\\n\\n                                      7\\n filed a motion to dismiss Count IV, arguing that the issues of\\n\\nwhether the City’s water rate charges to Outside Customers\\n\\namounted to an illegal tax and whether the City could transfer any\\n\\nprofits gleaned from the excess charges to its general fund were\\n\\nbeyond the scope of the statutory proceeding prescribed in OCGA §\\n\\n36-70-25.1 (d).\\n\\n     Following a hearing, the superior court granted the County’s\\n\\ncross-motion      for   partial   summary    judgment      on   the      road\\n\\nmaintenance funding issue and denied the City’s motion, concluding\\n\\nas a matter of law that road maintenance funding “is focused solely\\n\\non those ‘that receive the service.’” The court also denied the City’s\\n\\nsecond motion for partial summary judgment that sought to limit\\n\\nthe sources of revenue for funding services primarily for the benefit\\n\\nof the unincorporated areas to property taxes, insurance premium\\n\\ntaxes, assessments, or user fees under OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B). In\\n\\naddition, the court denied the City’s motion to dismiss Count IV of\\n\\n\\n\\n     such other mechanism agreed upon by the affected parties which\\n     complies with the intent of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph[.]\\n                                     8\\n the petition.\\n\\n     The City appealed the superior court’s orders to the Court of\\n\\nAppeals, which affirmed the superior court’s rulings in a split\\n\\ndecision. See City of Winder v. Barrow County, \\n365 Ga. App. 832\\n (\\n880\\n\\nSE2d 323\\n) (2022).\\n\\n     We granted the City’s petition for certiorari to consider the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals’s rulings on three questions:\\n\\n     (1) Is the maintenance of county roads in an unincorporated\\n\\narea of the County, which connect to roads within the City,\\n\\n“primarily for the benefit of the unincorporated area” as that phrase\\n\\nis used in OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A)?\\n\\n     (2) Does OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B) require that funding for\\n\\nservices provided primarily for the benefit of unincorporated areas\\n\\ncome from “property taxes, insurance premium taxes, assessments,\\n\\nor user fees” levied or imposed with a special service district, or does\\n\\nit authorize the County to use other sources of revenue?\\n\\n     (3) Is a superior court that is adjudicating a petition under\\n\\nOCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d) (2) authorized to determine whether the\\n\\n                                   9\\n City’s usage rates charged to water customers in unincorporated\\n\\nareas of the County are an illegal tax?\\n\\n     1. Addressing each of these issues in turn, we begin with the\\n\\nparties’ dispute over who should bear the cost of county road\\n\\nmaintenance in the unincorporated area of the County. Our review\\n\\nof the Court of Appeals’s rulings on the parties’ cross-motions for\\n\\npartial summary judgment is de novo because this appeal involves\\n\\nonly legal issues, not questions of fact.9 See Raffensperger v.\\n\\nJackson, \\n316 Ga. 383\\n, 387 (2) (\\n888 SE2d 483\\n) (2023).\\n\\n     The parties agree that the resolution of this issue is governed\\n\\nby OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A), which provides:\\n\\n     The [service delivery] strategy shall ensure that the cost\\n     of any service which a county provides primarily for the\\n     benefit of the unincorporated area of the county shall be\\n     borne by the unincorporated area residents, individuals,\\n     and property owners who receive the service.\\n\\nHowever, the parties disagree on the standard for determining\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     9 The parties did not submit evidence in the trial court in support of their\\n\\nsummary judgment motions on the issues of where the county roads are located\\nor who was actually using the roads and focused their arguments on the legal\\nissue of the standard to be used under OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A).\\n                                      10\\n whether maintenance of county roads is “primarily for the benefit of\\n\\nthe unincorporated area.” The County argues that if the county\\n\\nroads are available to anyone in the county to use, then the road\\n\\nmaintenance is not primarily for the benefit of the unincorporated\\n\\narea; in contrast, the City argues that as a matter of law, if the\\n\\ncounty roads are located primarily in the unincorporated area, then\\n\\nmaintenance of those roads is primarily for the benefit of the\\n\\nunincorporated area.\\n\\n     On cross-motions for partial summary judgment, the superior\\n\\ncourt agreed with the County and determined that the inquiry for\\n\\ndetermining who should bear the costs of road maintenance in this\\n\\ncase, “[should be] focused solely on those ‘that receive the service,’”\\n\\nciting the text at the end of the first sentence of OCGA § 36-70-24\\n\\n(3) (A), reasoning that the statute makes “no mention of where the\\n\\nservices are located.” In affirming the superior court’s ruling, the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals viewed the text of OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A)\\n\\ndifferently, determining that the concepts of road usage and\\n\\n“benefit,” as used in the statute, are “inextricably intertwined,” and\\n\\n                                  11\\n “the focus of the Act is not on the geographical location of the public\\n\\nservice, but on who uses (and thus benefits) from the service.”10\\n\\nWinder, 365 Ga. App. at 835-36 (1). The Court of Appeals further\\n\\ndetermined as a matter of law that county roads, “regardless of their\\n\\nspecific geographic location, benefit all residents of the county — as\\n\\ndoes their upkeep.” Id. at 836 (citing generally DeKalb County v. City\\n\\nof Decatur, \\n247 Ga. 695\\n, 697 (2) (\\n279 SE2d 427\\n) (1981) (“County\\n\\ntaxpayers residing in municipalities enjoy the use of DeKalb County\\n\\nparks, roads and other facilities, and the protection of the DeKalb\\n\\nCounty police, while they are going about their business or enjoying\\n\\ntheir leisure time outside the boundaries of the municipalities in\\n\\nwhich they reside.”)).\\n\\n      We begin our analysis by setting out first principles. “When we\\n\\nconsider the meaning of a statute, we must presume that the\\n\\nGeneral Assembly meant what it said and said what it meant.” Deal\\n\\nv. Coleman, \\n294 Ga. 170\\n, 172 (1) (a) (\\n751 SE2d 337\\n) (2013) (citation\\n\\n\\n\\n      10 The court noted that it was affirming the superior court under the\\n\\n“right for any reason” doctrine. Winder, 365 Ga. App. at 836 n. 6.\\n                                      12\\n and punctuation omitted). And “[a]s in all cases of statutory\\n\\nconstruction, we remain mindful that we must give the language its\\n\\nplain and ordinary meaning, view it in the context in which it\\n\\nappears, and read it in its most natural and reasonable way.” State\\n\\nv. Cook, \\n317 Ga. 659\\n, 660 (1) (\\n893 SE2d 670\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). We determine the ordinary public meaning of\\n\\nlegal text by considering the meaning the text had at the time it was\\n\\nenacted. See Seals v. State, \\n311 Ga. 739\\n, 740 (1) (\\n860 SE2d 419\\n)\\n\\n(2021), disapproved of on other grounds by Gonzales v. State, \\n315\\n\\nGa. 661\\n (\\n884 SE2d 339\\n) (2023). Dictionaries are often helpful “[i]n\\n\\nascertaining the ordinary meaning of a word that is not defined in a\\n\\nstatute,” but they “cannot be the definitive source of ordinary\\n\\nmeaning in questions of textual interpretation because they are\\n\\nacontextual, and context is a critical determinant of meaning.”\\n\\nMcBrayer v. Scarbrough, \\n317 Ga. 387\\n, 394 (2) (d) (\\n893 SE2d 660\\n)\\n\\n(2023).\\n\\n     Turning to the text, OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A) explains that the\\n\\n“cost of any service”—in this case, road maintenance—“which a\\n\\n                                 13\\n county provides primarily for the benefit of the unincorporated area\\n\\nof the county” shall be borne by persons in the unincorporated area\\n\\n“who receive the service.” Thus, the question is whether\\n\\nmaintenance of the County roads is a service that the County\\n\\n“provides primarily for the benefit of the unincorporated area.” The\\n\\nkey terms in that phrase are “primarily” and “benefit,” so we begin\\n\\nby construing those terms according to their meaning at the time of\\n\\ntheir enactment.\\n\\n     At the time the Act went into effect in 1997, the term\\n\\n“primarily” was defined for ordinary usage in this context as “for the\\n\\nmost part[,] chiefly.” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 925\\n\\n(10th ed. 1995). Black’s Law Dictionary defined “primary,” the\\n\\nadjectival form of the adverb “primarily,” as “[f]irst; principal; chief;\\n\\nleading.” Black’s Law Dictionary (Abridged) 826 (6th ed. 1991). See\\n\\nZaldivar v. Prickett, \\n297 Ga. 589\\n, 596 (1) (\\n774 SE2d 688\\n) (2015)\\n\\n(looking to Black’s Law Dictionary for “the usual and customary\\n\\nmeaning of [a] term as used in a legal context”). Moreover, in\\n\\nconstruing an ordinance that was enacted nine years after the Act,\\n\\n                                   14\\n this Court determined that the word “primarily\" is not ambiguous\\n\\nand means “for the most part,” (citing Merriam-Webster’s dictionary\\n\\nand also referencing the definition of the word “primarily” as\\n\\n“mainly; principally” in Webster’s New World College Dictionary\\n\\n(2007). Rockdale County v. U. S. Enterprises, Inc., \\n312 Ga. 752\\n, 767\\n\\n(3) (b) (\\n865 SE2d 135\\n) (2021), (citing United States v.

[;] [b]enefits\\n\\n\\n      11 We note that the county ordinance at issue in Rockdale expressly\\nprovided that all words not otherwise defined in the ordinance “are intended\\nto have the commonly accepted definitions contained in a recent edition of the\\nMerriam-Webster Dictionary.” Rockdale County, 312 Ga. at 755 (1). No such\\ndirection appears in the Act.\\n                                     15\\n are something to advantage of, or profit to, [the] recipient.” Black’s\\n\\nLaw Dictionary at 108.\\n\\n      Applying these definitions and considering the context and\\n\\nsyntax of the sentence in which these words appear in the statute,\\n\\nwe view the phrase “any service which a county provides primarily\\n\\nfor the benefit of the unincorporated area of the county” to mean any\\n\\nservice a county provides for the chief advantage, privilege, or\\n\\ninterest of, or chiefly and principally for the unincorporated area.\\n\\nAnd it is only if it is determined that the unincorporated area is the\\n\\nprimary beneficiary of the service that the “unincorporated area\\n\\nresidents, individuals, and property owners who receive the service”\\n\\nbear the costs of that service.\\n\\n     We see nothing in the text of OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A) that\\n\\nsupports the County’s argument that the correct standard for\\n\\ndetermining the primary beneficiary of a service turns solely on who\\n\\nuses the service. As we understand it, the County argues that the\\n\\nphrase “who receive the service” at the end of the first sentence of\\n\\nOCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A) means that those who have access to and\\n\\n                                  16\\n may use the service—in this case, maintenance of county roads—\\n\\nare, as a matter of law, those who primarily benefit from it under\\n\\nthe meaning of the statute. But this construction ignores the syntax\\n\\nand structure of OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A) and improperly links two\\n\\ngrammatically unrelated phrases in the text—the phrase “primarily\\n\\nfor the benefit of” and the phrase “who receive the service” at the\\n\\nend of the sentence—while ignoring the phrase “the unincorporated\\n\\narea of the county” that comes between them. Courts often rely on\\n\\nthe rules of grammar to provide a structure for discerning the\\n\\nordinary meaning of legal text, and we see no reason to depart from\\n\\nthose rules here. See State v. SASS Group, LLC, \\n315 Ga. 893\\n, 900-\\n\\n01 (2) (b) (\\n885 SE2d 761\\n) (2023) (“We may also refer to the rules of\\n\\nEnglish grammar, inasmuch as those rules are the guideposts by\\n\\nwhich ordinary speakers of the English language commonly\\n\\nstructure their words[.]”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Nevertheless, the County argues that any construction of\\n\\nOCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A) not based strictly on who uses the county\\n\\nroads would violate the Uniformity Clause of the Georgia\\n\\n                                 17\\n Constitution, Ga. Const. Art. VII, Sec. 1, Para. III (a) (“[A]ll taxation\\n\\nshall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the\\n\\nterritorial limits of the authority levying the tax.”). However, to the\\n\\nextent that the County is challenging the constitutionality of OCGA\\n\\n§ 36-70-24 (3) (A), we need not address that argument in this appeal\\n\\nbecause, even though the County raised the issue before the superior\\n\\ncourt, the court did not issue a ruling on it. See Franzen v.\\n\\nDowntown Dev. Auth. of Atlanta, \\n309 Ga. 411\\n, 425 (3) (d) n.27 (\\n845\\n\\nSE2d 539\\n) (2020) (“This Court does not reach the constitutionality\\n\\nof a statute unless it clearly appears in the record that the\\n\\nconstitutional issue was directly and properly raised in the trial\\n\\ncourt and distinctly ruled on by the trial judge.”) (emphasis omitted).\\n\\nMoreover, to the extent that the County is asserting that under the\\n\\ncanon of constitutional doubt we should construe OCGA § 36-70-24\\n\\n(3) (A) to avoid a potential conflict with the Uniformity Clause, that\\n\\ncanon does not apply to a statute that we have determined to be\\n\\nunambiguous. See Domingue v. Ford Motor Co., \\n314 Ga. 59\\n, 68 (2)\\n\\n(c) (\\n875 SE2d 720\\n) (2022) (courts cannot rely on the canon of\\n\\n                                   18\\n constitutional doubt where the legal text “is clear and is not\\n\\nsusceptible of more than one meaning”); Crowder v. State, \\n309 Ga.\\n\\n66\\n, 73 (2) (d) n.8 (\\n844 SE2d 806\\n) (2020) (explaining that the canon\\n\\nof constitutional doubt cannot be relied upon to avoid a “potential\\n\\nconstitutional issue” when “we can identify only one plausible\\n\\ninterpretation of [a] statute” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     The County also argues against our plain reading of the text\\n\\nof OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A), which requires an analysis of whether\\n\\nthe service primarily benefits the unincorporated area of the\\n\\ncounty–not simply a consideration of who uses the service–because\\n\\nit contradicts the interpretation of the Act set out in the publication\\n\\nCharting a Course for Cooperation and Collaboration – An\\n\\nIntroduction to the Service Delivery Strategy Act for Local\\n\\nGovernments. This document was published in 1997, after the date\\n\\nof the Act’s enactment, by the Georgia Department of Community\\n\\nAffairs, the department charged with implementing the Act, and\\n\\nseveral organizations involved in drafting the Act—the Association\\n\\nCounty    Commissioners     of   Georgia,   the   Georgia   Municipal\\n\\n                                  19\\n Association, and the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the\\n\\nUniversity of Georgia. The publication describes itself as a\\n\\n“guidebook” for city and county officials for implementation of the\\n\\nAct and does not purport to be binding legal authority. With respect\\n\\nto county road maintenance, this guidebook stated that, under the\\n\\nAct, county road maintenance is not provided primarily for the\\n\\nbenefit of the unincorporated area within the meaning of OCGA §\\n\\n36-70-24 (3) (A) because county roads are “available” to all county\\n\\nresidents, thus purporting to dictate that the only factor to be\\n\\nconsidered on the question of whether county road maintenance\\n\\nprimarily benefits the unincorporated area is who uses the roads,\\n\\ndespite the express language in the statute.\\n\\n     However, even in the unlikely event that this guidebook could\\n\\nconstitute an agency’s interpretation of a statute on par with duly\\n\\nadopted regulations, 12 we defer “to an agency’s interpretation [of\\n\\n\\n     12 Compare Pruitt Corp. v. Ga. Dept. of Community Health, \\n284 Ga. 158\\n,\\n\\n159-60 (1) (\\n664 SE2d 223\\n) (2008) (Court of Appeals erred in giving\\ninterpretation in agency manual deference due a statute, rule or regulation\\nwhere manual “had not undergone the scrutiny afforded a statute during the\\n\\n                                    20\\n legal text] only when we are unable to determine the meaning of the\\n\\nlegal text at issue.” City of Guyton v. Barrow, \\n305 Ga. 799\\n, 802 (2)\\n\\n(\\n828 SE2d 366\\n) (2019). In other words, we only defer to an agency’s\\n\\ninterpretation, if at all, when the text is ambiguous. Because we\\n\\ndiscern no ambiguity in the text of OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (A), we need\\n\\nnot consider the interpretation set forth in the guidebook. See id. at\\n\\n803 (2) (“A statute or regulation is not ambiguous merely because\\n\\ninterpreting it is hard.”) .\\n\\n     Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the\\n\\nsuperior court’s grant of partial summary judgment to the County\\n\\nand denial of partial summary judgment to the City on this issue, so\\n\\nwe reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\\n\\nopinion. To that end, we note that despite the arguments of the\\n\\nparties, the determination of whether county roads and their\\n\\nmaintenance are provided primarily for the benefit of the\\n\\nunincorporated area of the County does not depend just on one factor\\n\\n\\nlegislative process or the adoption process through which all rules and\\nregulations must pass”).\\n\\n                                  21\\n such as geography or usage, and we decline to determine as a matter\\n\\nof law whether county roads located mostly in the unincorporated\\n\\narea of the County are primarily for the benefit of the\\n\\nunincorporated area. Instead, whether road maintenance is\\n\\nprimarily for the benefit of the unincorporated area of the County is\\n\\na determination the superior court is authorized to make on remand\\n\\nafter an evidentiary hearing and after considering the totality of the\\n\\ncircumstances, including geographic location               and usage of the\\n\\nroads.13 See OCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d) (2) (“The visiting or senior judge\\n\\nshall conduct an evidentiary hearing or hearings as such judge\\n\\ndeems necessary and render a decision with regard to the disputed\\n\\nitems.”). 14\\n\\n      2. We next address whether OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B) requires\\n\\n\\n\\n      13 We emphasize that geographic location and usage of roads are only\\n\\ntwo factors that the superior court may consider depending on the evidence\\npresented by the parties, which could also include traffic studies and other\\nexpert analysis, and we decline to delineate or limit other factors that the\\nsuperior court may consider to make this determination.\\n      14 The Act provides that proceedings seeking resolution of SDS disputes\\n\\n“shall be assigned to a judge . . . who is not a judge in the circuit in which the\\ncounty is located. The judge selected may also be a senior judge . . . who resides\\nin another circuit.” OCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d) (1) A).\\n                                       22\\n that funding for services provided primarily for the benefit of the\\n\\nunincorporated area come from “property taxes, insurance premium\\n\\ntaxes, assessments, or user fees” levied or imposed within a special\\n\\nservice district, or, in contrast, it authorizes the County to use other\\n\\nsources of revenue from within that special service district.\\n\\n     OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B) states that the funding for services\\n\\nprovided primarily for the benefit of an unincorporated area\\n\\n     shall be derived from special service districts created by\\n     the county in which property taxes, insurance premium\\n     taxes, assessments, or user fees are levied or imposed or\\n     through such other mechanism agreed upon by the\\n     affected parties which complies with the intent of\\n     subparagraph (A) of this paragraph[.]\\n\\n     The County argues that “property taxes” and “assessments”\\n\\nrefer to general categories of funding and therefore the County is\\n\\nallowed to use any funding source within the special service district\\n\\nto pay for services intended primarily for the benefit of the\\n\\nunincorporated area. 15 The City argues, on the other hand, that the\\n\\n\\n     15   Specifically, the County argues that “property taxes” and\\n“assessments” include cable franchise taxes, alcohol excise taxes, financial\\ninstitution taxes, hotel/motel taxes, occupation taxes, and railroad equipment\\ntaxes.\\n                                     23\\n statutory list is intended to be exhaustive, that the term\\n\\n“assessments” means “special assessments” because “assessments”\\n\\nmust be read consistently with the other revenue sources listed,\\n\\nwhich are specific and not general terms, and that “property taxes”\\n\\nrefer only to ad valorem property taxes. 16\\n\\n     First, neither the term “property taxes” nor the term\\n\\n“assessments” is defined in the Act, so we must construe these terms\\n\\nusing the rules of statutory construction, some of which we have\\n\\nalready discussed in Division 1. The County somewhat simplistically\\n\\nargues that because “property” can refer to intangible, personal, or\\n\\nreal property, “property taxes” as used in the statute means any\\n\\nkind of tax on any kind of property. However, the County cites no\\n\\nauthority for that proposition.\\n\\n     In determining the original public meaning of the term\\n\\n“property taxes,” we first note that at the time of the statute’s\\n\\nenactment, Merriam-Webster defined property tax as “a tax levied\\n\\n\\n     16 The City and County do not appear to dispute the meaning of the terms\\n\\n“insurance premium taxes” and “user fees,” so our analysis will focus on the\\nmeaning of “property taxes” and “assessments.”\\n                                    24\\n on real or personal property,” Merriam-Webster at 935, and Black’s\\n\\ndefined “property tax” in the legal context as “[a]n ad valorem tax,\\n\\nusually levied by a city or county government, on the value of real\\n\\nor personal property that the taxpayer owns on a specified date.”\\n\\nBlack’s Law Dictionary at 847. As we have made clear, dictionaries\\n\\nare only a starting point for determining the original meaning of\\n\\ntext, particularly where, as here, the definitions are in tension. See\\n\\nMcBrayer, 317 Ga. at 394 (2) (d).\\n\\n     In determining the meaning of a term, “we may [also] look to\\n\\nother provisions of the same statute, the structure and history of the\\n\\nwhole statute, and the other law—constitutional, statutory, and\\n\\ncommon law alike—that forms the legal background of the statutory\\n\\nprovision in question.” Langley v. State, \\n313 Ga. 141\\n, 143 (2) (\\n868\\n\\nSE2d 759\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation omitted). In addition to\\n\\n“property taxes,” OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B) lists “insurance premium\\n\\ntaxes” as a potential source for revenue, which cuts against the\\n\\nCounty’s argument that the term property taxes refers to taxes of\\n\\nany kind because such an interpretation would improperly make the\\n\\n                                    25\\n term “insurance premium taxes” superfluous. See Camden County\\n\\nv. Sweatt, \\n315 Ga. 498\\n, 509 (2) (b) (\\n883 SE2d 827\\n) (2023) (noting\\n\\nfundamental rule of statutory construction that courts should “avoid\\n\\na construction that makes some language mere surplusage” (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     Also, OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B) refers to “special service\\n\\ndistricts” and makes clear that the listed mechanisms for funding\\n\\nare to be levied or imposed within a special service district. Thus, in\\n\\nthe legal background of OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B) is the Special\\n\\nDistricts Paragraph of the Georgia Constitution, which enables the\\n\\ncreation of special service districts “for the provision of local\\n\\ngovernment services within such districts,” and provides that “fees,\\n\\nassessments, and taxes may be levied and collected within such\\n\\ndistricts to pay, wholly or partially, the cost of providing such\\n\\nservices therein and to construct and maintain facilities therefor.”\\n\\nGa. Const. of 1983, Art. IX, Sec. 2, Par. VI. That the Special Districts\\n\\nParagraph lists the categories of funding sources for county services\\n\\nas “fees, assessments, and taxes” further supports that when the\\n\\n                                  26\\n General Assembly used the term “property taxes” instead of “taxes”\\n\\nin OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B), it intended to specify a subcategory of\\n\\ntaxes—ad valorem taxes levied on real or personal property—to the\\n\\nexclusion of other taxes, including the non-ad valorem taxes on\\n\\nproperty that the County claims it can use as funding sources. See\\n\\nPandora Franchising, LLC v. Kingdom Retail Group, LLLP, \\n299 Ga.\\n\\n723\\n, 728 (1) (b) (\\n791 SE2d 786\\n) (2016) (“Where the legislature uses\\n\\ncertain language in one part of the statute and different language in\\n\\nanother, the Court assumes different meanings were intended.”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     The County also argues that the term “assessments” in OCGA\\n\\n§ 36-70-24 (3) (B) refers to any kind of revenue measure. On the\\n\\nother hand, the City asserts that “assessments” refer only to “special\\n\\nassessments.” The statute provides no qualifier for the term\\n\\n“assessments,” and, at the time the statute was enacted, Merriam-\\n\\nWebster defined assessments as “the action or an instance of\\n\\nassessing” or “the amount assessed.” Merriam-Webster at 69. That\\n\\ndictionary defined “assess” in this context as “to determine the rate\\n\\n                                 27\\n or amount of (as a tax);” “to impose (as a tax) according to an\\n\\nestablished rate;” “to subject to a tax, charge, or levy;” and “to make\\n\\nan official valuation of (property) for the purpose of taxation.” Id.\\n\\nBlack’s defined “assessments” “[i]n a general sense” as “the process\\n\\nof ascertaining and adjusting the shares respectively to be\\n\\ncontributed by several persons towards a common beneficial object\\n\\naccording to the benefit received,” which “is often used in connection\\n\\nwith assessing property taxes or levying of property taxes.” Black’s\\n\\nLaw Dictionary at 77. Thus, these definitions support the County’s\\n\\nbroad reading of the term “assessments.”\\n\\n     However, if the General Assembly intended the term\\n\\n“assessments” to refer broadly to any kind of tax, the legislators’\\n\\ninclusion of the other specific items in the list in OCGA § 36-70-24\\n\\n(3) (B) would be surplusage, and, again, courts generally strive to\\n\\navoid a construction that “makes some language mere surplusage.”\\n\\nCamden County, 315 Ga. at 509 (2) (b) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)). Moreover, the text adopted in the Special Districts\\n\\nParagraph of the Georgia Constitution supports that “assessments”\\n\\n                                  28\\n are different in kind from “taxes” and “fees,” as, otherwise, there\\n\\nwould have been no need to list “fees, assessments, and taxes”\\n\\nseparately and on equal terms in the constitutional text. Likewise,\\n\\nthis Court has recognized that, as a general matter, assessments are\\n\\ndifferent in kind from taxes. See Hayden v. City of Atlanta, \\n70 Ga.\\n\\n817\\n, 822-23 (1884) (“Taxes are different from assessments for local\\n\\nimprovements, taxes being burdens upon all persons and property\\n\\nalike, and compensated for by equal protection to all, while\\n\\nassessments are not burdens but equivalents, and are laid for local\\n\\npurposes upon local objects, and are compensated for to some extent\\n\\nin local benefits and improvements, enhancing the value of the\\n\\nproperty assessed. Taxes are imposed on the person, assessments\\n\\nare imposed on the property.”). Accordingly, we construe the term\\n\\n“assessments” in OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B) as the act of charging a\\n\\nspecial payment but not to include fees and taxes. This construction\\n\\nwould include “special assessments,” but it is not limited to special\\n\\nassessments, as it could also include other assessments not\\n\\nclassified as taxes or fees.\\n\\n                                 29\\n      Therefore, we conclude that absent an agreement by the\\n\\nparties, OCGA § 36-70-24 (3) (B) limits the sources within a special\\n\\ndistrict that can be used to fund services provided for the primary\\n\\nbenefit of the unincorporated area of the county, that “property\\n\\ntaxes” means ad valorem property taxes, and that “assessments”\\n\\nrefer to any assessment that is not otherwise classified as a tax or\\n\\nfee, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this ground.\\n\\n     3. Finally, we consider whether the superior court, which is\\n\\nconducting this proceeding under OCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d), has the\\n\\nauthority in such a proceeding to determine whether the City’s\\n\\nusage rates charged to the Outside Customers constitute an illegal\\n\\ntax and whether the City is permitted to transfer profits from the\\n\\nexcess fees collected from water service to Outside Customers into\\n\\nits general fund. We conclude that the superior court is not so\\n\\nauthorized, and that it should have granted the City’s motion to\\n\\ndismiss Count IV on this ground.\\n\\n     Our review of a trial court’s decision on a motion to dismiss is\\n\\nde novo. See Southern States Chem., Inc. v. Tampa Tank & Welding,\\n\\n                                 30\\n Inc., \\n316 Ga. 701\\n, 706 (1) (\\n888 SE2d 553\\n) (2023). The Act provides a\\n\\ndetailed framework for local governments to use in negotiating and\\n\\ncrafting their SDS Agreements and the processes and procedures\\n\\nthat may be used in resolving any disputes. OCGA § 36-70-23 lists\\n\\nthe four items that need to be included in every service delivery\\n\\nstrategy,17 while OCGA § 36-70-24 describes the criteria that must\\n\\n\\n     17 Under, OCGA § 36-70-23,\\n\\n     Each local government service delivery strategy shall include the\\n     following components:\\n            (1) An identification of all local government services\\n     presently provided or primarily funded by each general purpose\\n     local government and each authority within the county, or\\n     providing services within the county, and a description of the\\n     geographic area in which the identified services are provided by\\n     each jurisdiction;\\n            (2) An assignment of which local government or authority,\\n     pursuant to the requirements of this article, will provide each\\n     service, the geographic areas of the county in which such services\\n     are to be provided, and a description of any services to be provided\\n     by any local government to any geographic area outside its\\n     geographical boundaries. In the event two or more local\\n     governments within the county are assigned responsibility for\\n     providing identical services within the same geographic area, the\\n     strategy shall include an explanation of such arrangement;\\n            (3) A description of the source of the funding for each service\\n     identified pursuant to paragraph (2) of this Code section; and\\n            (4) An identification of the mechanisms to be utilized to\\n     facilitate the implementation of the services and funding\\n     responsibilities identified pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of\\n     this Code section.\\n\\n\\n                                      31\\n be met in the development of a service delivery strategy.\\n\\nSpecifically, OCGA § 36-70-24 (2) sets out requirements and\\n\\nprocedures for strategies involving water or sewer services.\\n\\nSubsection (2) (A) of that statute provides “that water or sewer fees\\n\\ncharged to customers located outside the geographic boundaries of a\\n\\nservice provider shall not be arbitrarily higher than the fees charged\\n\\nto customers receiving such service which are located within the\\n\\ngeographic boundaries of the service provider.” Subsection (2) (B) of\\n\\nthe statute sets out a dispute resolution procedure for local\\n\\ngovernments to follow to challenge any alleged arbitrary rate\\n\\ndifferentials. That provision allows the contesting governing\\n\\nauthority to hold a public hearing for the purpose of reviewing the\\n\\nrate differential. See OCGA § 36-70-24 (2) (B). And should the\\n\\ngoverning authority wish to pursue a challenge, it must have a\\n\\nqualified engineer prepare a rate study and engage in alternative\\n\\ndispute resolution before taking its challenge “to a court of\\n\\ncompetent jurisdiction.” See id. As discussed above, OCGA § 36-70-\\n\\n25.1 (d) sets out the procedure for an aggrieved party to follow to\\n\\n                                 32\\n petition the superior court for resolution of items “remaining in\\n\\ndispute.”\\n\\n     Here, after presumably following the procedure laid out in\\n\\nOCGA § 36-70-24 (2) (B), the County filed its petition in this case\\n\\npursuant to OCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d) (2) to resolve the parties’\\n\\nremaining disputes. Count II of the amended petition requests\\n\\njudicial resolution of the arbitrariness of the water rate differential\\n\\ncharged by the City to the Outside Customers, and Count III seeks\\n\\na determination of whether the County had the authority to provide\\n\\nwater service to all customers located in the unincorporated area of\\n\\nthe County. These issues are clearly matters that must be addressed\\n\\nin negotiating a new SDS Agreement for the provision of water and\\n\\nsewage services, and thus disputes about such matters are\\n\\nconsidered issues “remaining in dispute” under the Act. See OCGA\\n\\n§§ 36-70-23; 36-70-24; 36-70-25.1 (d) 2).\\n\\n     However, Count IV seeks a determination as to whether the\\n\\nCity’s water charges constitute an illegal tax on the Outside\\n\\nCustomers and whether the City could transfer profits collected\\n\\n                                  33\\n from those customers to its general fund. These are not items that\\n\\nmust be negotiated as part of an SDS Agreement, see OCGA §§ 36-\\n\\n70-23 and 36-70-24 (2), and thus cannot be considered items\\n\\n“remaining in dispute” under the statutory process outlined in\\n\\nOCGA § 36-70-25.1 (d). Because Count IV seeks a judicial\\n\\ndetermination that is beyond the scope of the Act, its requested relief\\n\\nfalls outside the statutory dispute process contemplated by § 36-70-\\n\\n25.1 (d) (2). See City of Union Point v. Greene, \\n303 Ga. 449\\n, 459 (2)\\n\\n(\\n812 SE2d 278\\n) (2018) (superior court “is not authorized to grant\\n\\nrelief pursuant to OCGA § 36-70-25.1 beyond the scope of the\\n\\nremedies made available in that Code section”), disapproved of on\\n\\nother grounds by City of College Park v. Clayton County, \\n306 Ga. 301\\n\\n\\n(\\n830 SE2d 179\\n) (2019).\\n\\n      Accordingly, the superior court should have dismissed Count\\n\\nIV, and we reverse the portion of the Court of Appeals’s judgment\\n\\naffirming the trial court’s order denying the City’s motion to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  34\\n dismiss. 18\\n\\n     Judgment reversed and case remanded. All the Justices concur,\\nexcept Boggs, C.J., not participating.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      18 However, we note nothing in this opinion prevents the County from\\n\\nseeking declaratory, or other, relief on these issues in a separate proceeding.\\n                                       35\\n      BETHEL, Justice, concurring.\\n\\n     I agree with the analysis and conclusion of the opinion of the\\n\\nCourt and join it in full.\\n\\n     I write separately to provide additional discussion of the\\n\\nconsiderations included in making the factual determination of\\n\\nwhether a particular service is provided “primarily for the benefit”\\n\\nof an unincorporated area of a county as discussed in Division 1. See\\n\\nMaj. Op. at 22-23. In assessing the totality of the circumstances\\n\\nsurrounding the service’s provision, a superior court should\\n\\ncontemplate the possibility that the service, though located outside\\n\\nthe municipal limits and most frequently used by residents of the\\n\\nunincorporated     area,     nevertheless   has   no   evident   primary\\n\\nbeneficiary and, instead, benefits the public broadly. Regardless of\\n\\nany geographical assessment of the location of the capital\\n\\ninfrastructure of a particular service and without regard to its most\\n\\nfrequent users, many services by their very nature transcend the\\n\\nassignment of a primary beneficiary.\\n\\n     Thinking of this question as lying on a spectrum may be\\n\\n                                    36\\n helpful. On one end of the spectrum, services exist that are easily\\n\\nidentified as being provided for the primary (and perhaps even\\n\\nexclusive) benefit of unincorporated area(s). These services might\\n\\ninclude curbside rubbish collection exclusively from residences\\n\\noutside incorporated limits or a fire service whose coverage area is\\n\\nexclusively outside the incorporated limits. On the other end of the\\n\\nspectrum, however, are services that are rendered to the public\\n\\nwithout respect to municipal boundaries. Here, we might find, for\\n\\nexample, a county-wide police department or the core functions of a\\n\\ncounty courthouse. Where a service is provided and who it most\\n\\nfrequently serves are clearly relevant factors. But while they may\\n\\nseem determinative at the extremes of the spectrum, they are not\\n\\ndeterminative in a totality of the circumstances analysis.\\n\\n     Consider, for example, a few hypothetical services provided in\\n\\nimaginary Georgia counties. The first county provides potable water\\n\\nservice to all residents. The capital infrastructure, excluding\\n\\ndistribution pipes within the municipal boundaries, lies completely\\n\\nin the unincorporated area of the county while less than ten percent\\n\\n                                 37\\n of county residents live inside the municipal boundary. Thus, while\\n\\nconsideration of where the capital assets lie and the numerical\\n\\nutilization of the service might suggest that this service was\\n\\nprimarily for the benefit of the unincorporated area, the very nature\\n\\nof the service makes clear that the service is delivered to and equally\\n\\nbenefits all county residents. The second county constructs a large\\n\\nregional recreational facility in an unincorporated area. The park is\\n\\nfar more accessible to county residents of the unincorporated area,\\n\\nwho are the primary local users of its amenities. But the park is\\n\\nfrequently used to host tournaments and festivals that draw visitors\\n\\nto the community from other counties. These visitors frequent retail\\n\\nshops, restaurants, and hotels which are almost exclusively located\\n\\ninside municipal boundaries. Here again, the question of primary\\n\\nbenefit would be incomplete if we considered only the location of the\\n\\nservice and frequency of use as between residents of the\\n\\nincorporated and unincorporated portions of the county.\\n\\nIn sum, I believe the Court has correctly identified the challenge as\\n\\nrequiring an analysis of the totality of the circumstances. For many\\n\\n                                  38\\n services, this may be a relatively easy task (but it seems unlikely\\n\\nthat the truly easy ones will evade resolution by the municipal and\\n\\ncounty governments prior to judicial consideration). It may well be\\n\\nthat most of these decisions will turn on the location of the service\\n\\nprovision or the frequency of utilization, as seems to be the primary\\n\\nthrust of the municipality’s argument in this case. Nevertheless, I\\n\\nview the nature of the service provided as a critical, though not\\n\\ndispositive, consideration in the primary beneficiary inquiry – a\\n\\nconsideration that may be particularly apt in the context of the case\\n\\nat hand. A municipality that is logistically cut off from the\\n\\nsurrounding environment at the city limits would not long survive.\\n\\nAny consideration of the beneficiaries of a transportation system in\\n\\nand through the unincorporated portions of a county would be\\n\\nincomplete without an assessment of the value derived by the\\n\\nmunicipality from being connected to the larger world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 39\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9481024/city-of-winder-v-barrow-county/'}),\n",

Penn Spell, Jr., for appellant.\\nSwertfeger & Scott, Thomas L. Scott, Curtis R. Richardson, Jack H. Thrasher, L. Jack Swertfeger, for appellee.\\nHILL, Justice.\\nThe petitioner in this quo warranto action contends that Heyward Woodward, the respondent, should be removed from the office of county commissioner of Rockdale County because he had not resided in that county for five years prior to his election on November 2, 1976, as would be required by the 1941 local act establishing the office.[1] The trial court overruled Woodward\\'s motion to dismiss which challenged the statute on constitutional grounds, but after a hearing on June 17, 1977, the trial court denied quo warranto. Both parties have appealed.\\nThe Georgia Constitution provides that no person shall be a \"county officer\" unless he shall have been a resident of the county for two years.[2] We must decide whether a county commissioner is a county officer within the meaning of this constitutional provision, and if so, whether the General Assembly may impose a longer residency requirement than is fixed by our Constitution.\\n*771 1. Are county commissioners county officers within the meaning of the Constitution? Code Ann. § 2-5808. The conflict in Georgia authority on this issue has been previously noted. Smith v. Abercrombie, 235 Ga. 741, 747 (221 SE2d 802) (1975); R. Sentell, Studies in Georgia Local Government Law, pp. 199-219 (1977), and 15 Mercer L. Rev. 258, 265-266 (1963).\\nSeveral decisions hold that the county commissioners are county officers within the meaning of the constitutional provision. County commissioners were found to be such county officers in Hulgan v. Thornton, 205 Ga. 753, 756 (55 SE2d 115) (1949), which affirmed the ruling that the person elected to the office of county commissioner was not qualified at the time of his election because he was not a qualified voter as required. In Sweat v. Barnhill, 171 Ga. 294 (9) (155 SE 18) (1930), the court reversed the dismissal of a petition in quo warranto holding that the legislature could not by special Act appoint a person to the office of county commissioner in disregard of the constitutional requirement that county officers be elected by the qualified voters of their respective counties or districts.[3] See also Lance v. Stepp, 232 Ga. 675 (208 SE2d 559) (1974). Malone v. Minchew, 170 Ga. 687 (2) (153 SE 773) (1930), had reached the same result, finding that the legislature could not ignore a general statute[4] which repeated the constitutional *772 requirement that a county officer must be a qualified voter. McCranie v. Minchew, 170 Ga. 691 (154 SE 776), and Davis v. Minchew, 170 Ga. 691 (154 SE 189) (1930), followed Malone, supra.[5]\\nThe case of Marshall v. Walker, 183 Ga. 44 (1) (187 SE 81) (1936), should not be read to indicate that county commissioners are not county officers. Marshall found that qualifications for the office of county school superintendent were not limited by Code Ann. § 2-5808. The Marshall court held that Code Ann. § 2-5808 applied only to those county offices which were in existence at the time of adoption of the 1877 Constitution, which was still in force in 1936 when Marshall was decided. Marshall cautioned that insofar as Sweat v. Barnhill, supra, did not comport with this rule, that case was not followed in Marshall. The office of county commissioner was in existence both in 1877, see Waller v. Perkins, 52 Ga. 233 (5) (1873); Churchill v. Walker, 68 Ga. 681 (6) (1882), and in 1945, when the pertinent provisions of the 1877 Constitution were reenacted in substantially their same form in the 1945 Constitution. Therefore, the caveat as to county school superintendents does not reduce the force of Sweat v. Barnhill, supra, as to county commissioners.\\nOn the other hand, Rhodes v. Jernigan, 155 Ga. 523 (2) (117 SE 432) (1923), held that the office of county *773 commissioner was not a county office. The Rhodes court would not conform that office to the 1914 constitutional amendment which increased the term of office of county officers to four years.[6] That part of the holding in Rhodes is in direct conflict with the weight of the subsequent decisions of this court and will no longer be followed. Parks v. Ash, 168 Ga. 868 (5) (149 SE 207) (1929), which considered county commissioners to be \"creatures of statutes,\" and Wilson v. Harris, 170 Ga. 800 (2, 3) (154 SE 388) (1930), which relied in part on the disapproved holding of Rhodes v. Jernigan, supra, will not be followed insofar as they would remove the office of county commissioner from the operation of the constitutional provision regarding county officers.[7]\\nWe are not unmindful of those provisions of the Constitution which allow the General Assembly much *774 authority to establish the duties, powers and jurisdiction of and the remedies against county commissioners.[8] \"[These provisions] in regard to creation of county commissioners and defining their duties [were] not intended, however, to authorize the legislature to violate every other provision in the constitution under the name of defining the duties of the county commissioners ...\" Board of Commrs. of Sumter County v. Mayor of Americus, supra. These two provisions do not clearly except county commissioners from the constitutional provisions of Code Ann. § 2-5808 regarding county officers. \"The different provisions of the constitution are to be construed as in harmony with one another rather than as contradictory.\" Board of Commrs. of Sumter County, supra, at 544. We hold that the office of county commissioner is a county office governed by the constitutional provisions of what is now the Constitution of 1976 (Art. IX, Sec. I, Par. VIII; Code Ann. § 2-5808).\\n2. May the General Assembly impose a residency requirement as a condition of eligibility to an office of county commissioner longer than the requirement fixed by the Constitution that a county officer \". . . shall have been a resident of the county for two years\"? Code Ann. § 2-5808. In White v. Clements, 39 Ga. 232, 265 (1869), the *775 court wrote that \". . . if the Constitution prescribes a qualification for an officer, it by necessary implication denies to the Legislature the power to fix new and other qualifications.\" Where the Constitution has prescribed the qualifications which allow and prevent eligibility to a public office, the General Assembly cannot by statute add to or take from those conditions of eligibility. See Ray v. Hand, 225 Ga. 589, 591 (170 SE2d 692) (1969). \"It is quite generally considered that where the constitution lays down specific eligibility requirements for a particular constitutional office, the constitutional specification in that regard is exclusive and the legislature (except where expressly authorized to do so) has no power to require additional or different qualifications for such constitutional office.\" Annot. 34 ALR2d 155, 171, § 6 (1954).\\nWe find that the condition in Ga. Laws 1941, pp. 952 to 954, supra, which requires five years residence for eligibility to the office of county commissioners is invalid because the Constitution requires that a county officer shall have been a resident of the county for two years. Therefore the judgment denying quo warranto is affirmed.\\nJudgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\nNOTES\\n[1] Ga. L. 1941, pp. 952, 954: \"No person shall be elected as Commissioner of said County [Rockdale] unless he be of thirty years of age and having had residence in said County five years prior to his election.\"\\n[2] \"The county officers shall be elected by the qualified voters of their respective counties or districts, and shall hold their office for four years. They shall be removed upon conviction for malpractice in office; and no person shall be eligible for any of the offices referred to in this Paragraph unless he shall have been a resident of the county for two years and is a qualified voter.\" 1976 Const., Art. IX, Sec. I, Par. VIII; Code Ann. § 2-5808 (1977); 1945 Const., Art. IX, Sec. II, Par. I; Code Ann. § 2-7901 (1946); 1877 Const., Art. XI, Sec. II, Par. I, as amended; Code Ann. § 2-8301 (1933); Code § 6599 (1910); Code § 5929 (1895), Code § 5227 (1882). See 1868 Const., Art. IX, Par. I; Code § 5140 (1873).\\n[3] The use of the word \"districts\" in the constitutional provision confirms the correctness of the decision we reach today because county commissioners are the only county officials elected from districts within the county. Other county officials are elected from the county at large. Hence the inclusion of \"districts\" was a reference to county commissioners. Regarding county school officials, see Saxon v. Bell, 201 Ga. 797 (41 SE2d 536) (1947); see also Ga. L. 1887, p. 68, Secs. XVI, XXIV, Ga. L. 1872, p. 64, Sec. XIII. Regarding justices of the peace, see Long v. State, 127 Ga. 285 (56 SE 424) (1906); see also Overton v. Gandy, 170 Ga. 562, 565 (153 SE 520) (1930).\\n[4] Code Ann. § 89-101(7) (Supp. 1977); Code § 258(7) (1910); Code § 223 (7) (1895).\\n[5] Our holding today with regard to the constitutional qualifications of the office of county commissioner is not intended to affect other limits which may have been established by the Constitution on the broad legislative power to establish the duties, powers, and jurisdiction of and the remedies against a county commissioner. See, e. g., County of Pulaski v. Thompson & Co., 83 Ga. 270 (9 SE 1065) (1889); Phinizy v. Eve, 108 Ga. 360 (2) (33 SE 1007) (1899); Moore v. Whaley, 189 Ga. 647 (7 SE2d 394) (1940); Wilson v. Jones, 218 Ga. 706 (130 SE2d 227) (1963); but see, e.g., Atkinson v. Bailey, 135 Ga. 336 (69 SE 540) (1910); Board of Commrs. of Sumter County v. Mayor of Americus, 141 Ga. 542 (81 SE 435) (1914); Hood v. Burson, 194 Ga. 30 (20 SE2d 755) (1942); Nash v. Nat. Preferred Life Ins. Co., 222 Ga. 14 (3) (148 SE2d 402) (1966). See Sentell, supra.\\n[6] Ga. L. 1914, p. 43, ratified Nov. 3, 1914, to be effective January 1, 1917. See editorial note following Code § 2-8301 (1933). The correctness of the decision in Rhodes v. Jernigan, supra, is put in doubt when it is found that at the 1915 and 1916 sessions of the General Assembly, the county commissioners of many counties were given four year terms effective January 1, 1917. Ga. L. 1915, p. 140 et seq.; Ga. L. 1916, p. 332 et seq.\\n[7] Dicta in Employees Retirement System v. Lewis, 109 Ga. App. 476, 479 (136 SE2d 518) (1964), and Op. Att\\'y Gen. 69-454 regarding county commissioners are also disapproved. However, those sources provide a general listing of what offices are, and what offices are not, county offices. It is generally agreed that the office of clerk of superior court is a county office within the meaning of Code Ann. § 2-5808. McGill v. Simmons, 172 Ga. 127 (1) (157 SE 273) (1930). Yet, that office is created by statute. Code Ann. § 24-2701 et seq. Hence, appellee\\'s argument that the office of county commissioner is a statutory rather than a constitutional county office is of no significance. The predecessor of Code Ann. § 2-5808, namely, Art. IX, Sec. I of the Constitution of 1868, recognized that the county offices referred to were created by law rather than the Constitution.\\n[8] 1976 Const., Art. IX, Sec. I, Par.

SCONYERS v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        ELLINGTON, Justice.\\n\\n        Charles Michael Sconyers appeals his convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and cruelty to children in the first degree in connection with\\n\\nthe death of Chelsea Finch’s 23-month-old son, Lincoln Davitte,\\n\\nfrom blunt-force trauma to his skull. 1 The State presented evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 The crimes occurred on May 1, 2019. On November 5, 2020, a Columbia\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Sconyers for malice murder, two counts of felony\\nmurder, and one count each of aggravated assault and cruelty to children in\\nthe first degree. After a jury trial that ended on May 13, 2022, Sconyers was\\nfound guilty on all counts. On that same day, Sconyers was sentenced to serve\\nlife in prison for malice murder and concurrent 20-year prison terms for\\naggravated assault and cruelty to children. The felony murder counts were\\nvacated by operation of law. The trial court later conducted a resentencing\\nhearing and, on May 25, 2022, entered a new sentence that merged the\\naggravated assault count into the malice murder conviction but did not change\\nthe other sentences. Sconyers filed a timely motion for new trial, which he\\namended on September 12, 2022. After a hearing on February 27, 2023, the\\ntrial court denied the amended motion for new trial on March 20, 2023.\\nSconyers filed a timely notice of appeal, and the case was docketed in this Court\\nto the term beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the\\nbriefs.\\n at trial showing that Sconyers and Finch lived together and that\\n\\nwhile Lincoln was at home in the sole care of Sconyers, Lincoln\\n\\nsustained a severe head injury that several medical experts testified\\n\\nwas not consistent with a ground-level fall on the patio as described\\n\\nby Sconyers. Lincoln died later at the hospital. Sconyers contends\\n\\nthat the trial court erred in four ways: repeatedly permitting the\\n\\nState to introduce evidence of previous injuries to Lincoln without\\n\\ncautioning the jury that the parties agreed that Sconyers did not\\n\\ncause those injuries; instructing the jury about “prior difficulties”\\n\\nbetween Sconyers and Lincoln without limiting what evidence\\n\\nqualified as prior difficulties; admitting hearsay statements\\n\\nallegedly made by Finch; and permitting the prosecution to impeach\\n\\nFinch improperly. For the reasons explained below, we affirm.\\n\\n     Sconyers had moved in with Lincoln and Finch, as well as her\\n\\nthen-four-year-old daughter, near the end of 2018. On May 1, 2019,\\n\\nFinch had to work until 6:00 p.m. and asked Sconyers, who was not\\n\\nworking his job as a firefighter and EMT because he had recently\\n\\nbeen injured, to pick up Lincoln from daycare while she went to the\\n\\n                                 2\\n grocery store. Surveillance video footage showed Finch at the\\n\\ngrocery store, and other video footage showed Sconyers leaving the\\n\\ndaycare with Lincoln at 6:19 p.m. An investigator testified that he\\n\\nreviewed surveillance video footage from the daycare for the whole\\n\\nday and did not observe anything that could have contributed to\\n\\nLincoln’s injuries. At some point, Sconyers called a friend and co-\\n\\nworker who was a paramedic and told him about an unconscious\\n\\nchild with breathing problems. The co-worker told Sconyers to\\n\\n“[h]ang up and call 911.” Sconyers called 911 at 6:36 p.m. and\\n\\nsubsequently called Finch, screaming that she needed “to get home\\n\\nnow” and that something happened to Lincoln. Sconyers said he did\\n\\nnot know what happened. There was no evidence that anyone other\\n\\nthan Sconyers was at the home with Lincoln at that time. Finch\\n\\narrived before emergency responders and ran into the bedroom\\n\\nwhere Lincoln was lying on the bed unresponsive with a “bulge” on\\n\\nthe right side of the top of his head, and Sconyers was trying to\\n\\nassess Lincoln as “an EMT should do” and “get his pupils to react.”\\n\\nWhen they heard sirens, Finch picked up Lincoln, ran with him, and\\n\\n                                3\\n begged Sconyers to take him to the ambulance. Sconyers took\\n\\nLincoln the rest of the way and was invited to ride in the ambulance\\n\\nto the hospital because Sconyers was an EMT.\\n\\n     The firefighters who first responded to the 911 call testified\\n\\nthat Lincoln was unresponsive and not breathing adequately and\\n\\nthat Sconyers told them Lincoln had a ground-level fall off a ledge\\n\\nonto concrete and had other bruises on his face and head because he\\n\\nhad a problem with sleepwalking. One of the two paramedics, who\\n\\narrived in an ambulance very soon after the firefighters, testified\\n\\nthat Lincoln was “posturing,” which typically happens after a severe\\n\\nclosed-head injury, and that based on her training and expertise the\\n\\ninjury did not appear to be caused by a ground-level fall. The witness\\n\\ntestified that Sconyers told her “two stories” in the back of the\\n\\nambulance: first, Lincoln was standing on a porch and fell about two\\n\\nto three feet off a ledge; and second, he fell on a “wheel chock”; and\\n\\nSconyers later told another paramedic that Lincoln slipped on a door\\n\\nthreshold and tripped and fell. The other paramedic also testified\\n\\nbased on her experience that Lincoln’s skull fracture was not\\n\\n                                  4\\n consistent with a fall of two to three feet. Sconyers kept repeating\\n\\nthat it was his “fault” if anything happened to Lincoln.\\n\\n     Finch testified that at the hospital, after Lincoln had surgery,\\n\\nSconyers told her that after getting home Lincoln wanted to go\\n\\noutside to play with chalk. Sconyers opened the outside door, went\\n\\nto the bathroom to take his knee brace off, and told Lincoln to go\\n\\noutside. Lincoln then “took off running,” and Sconyers heard a loud\\n\\nthump and a cry and ran to find Lincoln lying out back on the\\n\\nconcrete patio. Finch further testified that no one was at home with\\n\\nSconyers and Lincoln at the time, that she did not know of any prior\\n\\nfracture of Lincoln’s skull, and that she was not aware of anything\\n\\nprior to the fatal incident that could have resulted in any type of\\n\\nbrain injury to Lincoln.\\n\\n     Both parties presented medical experts who testified about\\n\\nLincoln’s injuries. Extensive testimony from the State’s experts\\n\\nshowed that the nature and severity of Lincoln’s fatal brain injury\\n\\nmade it highly unlikely the injury was caused accidentally by a fall\\n\\nat ground level or from a low height. One of those experts testified\\n\\n                                  5\\n that symptoms of that fatal injury would have appeared\\n\\nimmediately after the impact, and Lincoln could not have continued\\n\\nto move normally after sustaining those injuries. The GBI medical\\n\\nexaminer who performed an autopsy on Lincoln classified Lincoln’s\\n\\ndeath as a homicide because her examination and the medical\\n\\nrecords indicated that “non-accidental-inflicted trauma” caused the\\n\\nfatal injury and because the historical account of the incident\\n\\nprovided by Sconyers did not explain Lincoln’s injuries. One of\\n\\nSconyers’s medical experts testified that it was reasonably possible\\n\\nthat Lincoln’s fatal injury resulted from an accident, in part because\\n\\na prior head injury that caused a subdural hematoma made him\\n\\n“more prone to get a new one with more serious complications.”\\n\\n     Sconyers testified in his own defense as follows. He was a\\n\\nsergeant and advanced EMT with the Augusta Fire Department.\\n\\nThe week before Lincoln’s death, Sconyers and his lieutenant went\\n\\ninto a burning home to search for a little boy who was unaccounted\\n\\nfor at the time, and Sconyers fell through the floor, injuring his knee.\\n\\nFor that reason, Sconyers had a knee brace, was on leave, and was\\n\\n                                   6\\n able to pick up Lincoln from daycare on May 1, 2019. When they\\n\\narrived home, Sconyers told Lincoln he could play outside with chalk\\n\\nand opened the door for him. Sconyers went to use the bathroom and\\n\\nadjust his knee brace, and he told Lincoln to go outside. Lincoln\\n\\n“took off running,” and Sconyers heard a thump and heard Lincoln\\n\\n“almost scream.” Sconyers strapped his knee brace back on,\\n\\n“hobbled” outside as fast as he could, and found Lincoln lying\\n\\n“outside of [the] back patio.” Lincoln turned his head “just a little\\n\\nbit” and became unresponsive. Sconyers stabilized Lincoln’s neck\\n\\nand body, took him inside, and immediately called 911.\\n\\n     1. Sconyers contends that the trial court erred by permitting\\n\\nthe State repeatedly to introduce evidence of Lincoln’s previous\\n\\ninjuries without cautioning the jury that the parties agreed that\\n\\nSconyers did not cause those injuries.\\n\\n     Prior to the presentation of any evidence to the jury, Sconyers\\n\\nmoved under OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (“Rule 404 (b)”) to exclude any\\n\\ntestimony that Lincoln “had black eyes on two different occasions”\\n\\nin the months before his death. Rule 404 (b) requires the exclusion\\n\\n                                 7\\n of “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts” the defendant may\\n\\nhave committed to prove the defendant’s bad character and show he\\n\\nacted “in conformity therewith” in committing the charged offense.\\n\\nSconyers argued that Lincoln’s prior black-eye injuries fell under\\n\\nRule 404 (b) because they were extrinsic to Lincoln’s death, and that\\n\\nthey had to be excluded under that rule because the State could not\\n\\nprove that Sconyers caused the injuries. But the prosecutor argued\\n\\nthat Lincoln’s prior injuries did not fall under Rule 404 (b) at all\\n\\nbecause they were intrinsic to the crime. See Roberts v. State, \\n315\\n\\nGa. 229\\n, 235 (2) (a) (\\n880 SE2d 501\\n) (2022) (“The limitations and\\n\\nprohibition on ‘other acts’ evidence set out in [Rule ]404 (b) do not\\n\\napply to ‘intrinsic evidence.’” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\nSpecifically, the prosecutor argued that the State needed to\\n\\nintroduce the prior injuries to explain the circumstances behind\\n\\nLincoln’s prior head injuries, because Sconyers’s expected defense\\n\\nwas that Lincoln’s prior head trauma – which caused the presence\\n\\nof both “old blood and new blood” in Lincoln’s brain, according to a\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 8\\n defense expert – could have contributed to his death. 2 The trial court\\n\\nagreed with the prosecution that the prior injuries were admissible\\n\\nas intrinsic evidence – not falling under Rule 404 (b) – because they\\n\\nallowed the State to explain and rebut the testimony of Sconyers’s\\n\\nexpert. See Johnson v. State, \\n312 Ga. 481\\n, 491 (4) (\\n863 SE2d 137\\n)\\n\\n(2021) (Evidence is intrinsic when it is “necessary to complete the\\n\\nstory of the crime.” (citation and punctuation omitted)). The trial\\n\\ncourt also found that the evidence satisfied OCGA § 24-4-403 (“Rule\\n\\n403”).\\n\\n      On appeal, Sconyers does not challenge the trial court’s ruling\\n\\nthat the prior injuries were admissible as intrinsic evidence.\\n\\nInstead, he raises a two-part argument that he did not raise below:\\n\\nthat the trial court allowed testimony about Lincoln’s previous\\n\\ninjuries to be repeatedly introduced3 and did not caution the jury\\n\\n\\n      2 One of the State’s medical experts also testified that surgery on Lincoln\\n\\nrevealed “old clot and new clot,” that is, “blood from a prior injury and blood\\nfrom this injury.”\\n      3 Sconyers described the evidence of Lincoln’s prior injuries as going “far\\n\\nbeyond merely providing a medical explanation for ‘old blood’” and having\\n“function[ed]” as additional evidence of “prior difficulties” between Sconyers\\nand Lincoln “through the State’s associations and inferences created through\\nrepetition and questioning.”\\n                                       9\\n that the parties agreed that Sconyers did not cause those injuries.\\n\\nBut Sconyers never objected on those bases in the trial court, and he\\n\\nnever requested a limiting instruction that the parties had agreed\\n\\nSconyers did not cause Lincoln’s prior injuries. This enumeration\\n\\ntherefore can be reviewed only for plain error. See OCGA §§ 17-8-58\\n\\n(b); 24-1-103 (a) (1); Henderson v. State, \\n317 Ga. 66\\n, 78 (4) (c) (\\n891\\n\\nSE2d 884\\n) (2023) (The appellant “did not ask for a limiting\\n\\ninstruction at trial, so we review his claim [that allowing certain\\n\\nevidence was error without an accompanying limiting instruction]\\n\\nonly for plain error.”); Payne v. State, \\n313 Ga. 218\\n, 221 (1) (\\n869 SE2d\\n\\n395\\n) (2022) (The appellant asserted on appeal that the trial court\\n\\nerred by admitting testimony about a certain incident because it “did\\n\\nnot qualify as a prior difficulty” under Rule 404 (b), but he “did not\\n\\nobject on the ground” asserted on appeal. “Thus, [he] failed to\\n\\npreserve [the enumerated] error for ordinary review.”). We see no\\n\\nplain error.\\n\\n     To show plain error, an appellant must identify an error that\\n\\nwas not affirmatively waived, was obvious beyond reasonable\\n\\n                                  10\\n dispute, affected the outcome of his trial or otherwise affected his\\n\\nsubstantial rights, and seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or\\n\\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings. See Henderson, 317 Ga. at\\n\\n78 (4) (c); Payne, 313 Ga. at 222 (1). “For an error to be obvious for\\n\\npurposes of plain error review, it must be plain under controlling\\n\\nprecedent or in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or\\n\\nrule.” Grier v. State, \\n313 Ga. 236\\n, 242 (3) (b) (\\n869 SE2d 423\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Sconyers’s claim of error relates to testimony from Finch, a\\n\\ndaycare employee, and a DFCS employee addressing Lincoln’s black\\n\\neyes. Finch testified that she saw Lincoln with black eyes on two\\n\\noccasions prior to his death. In February 2019, Lincoln was sleeping,\\n\\nand she and Sconyers were in the bathroom when they heard\\n\\nsomething. Sconyers left and returned “in a couple of seconds” with\\n\\nLincoln, who had a big “goose egg” in the middle of his head but was\\n\\n“grinning,” did not have dilated pupils, continued to act like a\\n\\n“normal” child the rest of the night, and was not lethargic or fussy.\\n\\nFinch believed Lincoln was injured a few times from sleepwalking,\\n\\n                                 11\\n and she discussed the situation with Lincoln’s pediatrician. Finch\\n\\ntestified that on April 29, 2019, while Finch’s mother was\\n\\nbabysitting Lincoln, he was climbing on his highchair when his foot\\n\\nslipped and he hit his eye on it. The defense later called Finch’s\\n\\nmother, who confirmed that when she was with Lincoln a day or two\\n\\nbefore his fatal injury, he injured himself on a highchair, causing a\\n\\nlittle bruise on the right side of his face.\\n\\n     An employee at the daycare center that Finch’s children\\n\\nattended, Brenda Warren, testified that in February 2019 she filled\\n\\nout an incident report when Lincoln arrived with two black eyes and\\n\\na bruised face, and Finch said he was jumping on his bed and hit the\\n\\ntop of it, but she did not take him to the doctor because her\\n\\n“boyfriend was a paramedic” and he did not feel it was necessary.\\n\\nBecause Finch’s comments “just didn’t seem right,” Warren\\n\\nultimately called Child Protective Services. Afterwards, Warren\\n\\nnoticed that Sconyers was not picking Lincoln up at the daycare\\n\\nanymore. Warren also testified to a second incident, on April 29,\\n\\n2019, two days before Lincoln’s death, when Lincoln had a black eye\\n\\n                                    12\\n and Warren was told that he had fallen, and a third incident, on May\\n\\n1, when Lincoln had a cut on his lip. Warren described Lincoln as an\\n\\n“active” and “happy” child who “napped well,” “ate well,” and played\\n\\nwith his friends on the playground.\\n\\n     The DFCS employee who investigated the two black-eye\\n\\nincidents testified that the daycare called DFCS because it was\\n\\n“concerned about the safety of the child” and felt that the incidents\\n\\nwere “too close” in time. As a result, she talked with Finch and\\n\\nSconyers and was told that Lincoln’s pediatrician had diagnosed him\\n\\nas a sleepwalker, and the first injury occurred when Lincoln fell\\n\\nwhile sleepwalking, and that the second injury occurred when\\n\\nLincoln fell on a highchair at his grandmother’s home.\\n\\n     We see no plain error because Sconyers’s claims related to this\\n\\ntestimony about the circumstances surrounding Lincoln’s prior\\n\\ninjuries do not show that the trial court acted contrary to any\\n\\ncontrolling authority. Sconyers contends the trial court should have\\n\\ninstructed the jury that the parties had agreed he did not cause\\n\\nLincoln’s prior injuries. But we are aware of no authority requiring\\n\\n                                 13\\n the court to give that limiting instruction. See Salvesen v. State, \\n317\\n\\nGa. 314\\n, 317 (2) (\\n893 SE2d 66\\n) (2023) (The State is “not required to\\n\\nstipulate to . . . the circumstances surrounding the murder.”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)); Anderson v. State, \\n313 Ga. 178\\n,\\n\\n183 (3) (a) (\\n869 SE2d 401\\n) (2022) (“[A] limiting instruction generally\\n\\nis not warranted for intrinsic evidence.”). Sconyers also contends\\n\\nthat too many witnesses testified about the prior injuries, but again,\\n\\nno authority required a limit on the number of those witnesses. The\\n\\nexistence of “some overlap” and “substantial prejudicial effect” in the\\n\\ntestimony of multiple witnesses does not necessarily make that\\n\\nevidence so needlessly cumulative or unfairly prejudicial as to\\n\\nrequire its exclusion under Rule 403. Naples v. State, \\n308 Ga. 43\\n, 53\\n\\n(2) (\\n838 SE2d 780\\n) (2020). Accordingly, it was not obvious either that\\n\\nsome of the testimony about Lincoln’s prior injuries should have\\n\\nbeen excluded or that the jury should have been instructed that\\n\\nSconyers did not cause those injuries. Sconyers therefore has failed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  14\\n to show error that is clear beyond reasonable dispute.4\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Sconyers also argues under this enumeration that certain evidence of\\n\\nhis prior difficulties with Lincoln – which we describe below in Division 3,\\nspecifically, Lincoln’s jealousy toward Sconyers, Sconyers hitting Lincoln, and\\nthe arguing and fighting between the two – was improperly admitted under\\nRule 404 (b). As an initial matter, Sconyers’s objection at trial did not extend\\nto this evidence, contrary to his contention on appeal. His specific objection in\\nthe trial court was only to testimony that Lincoln “had black eyes on two\\ndifferent occasions several months before the incident,” and Sconyers’s\\nsubsequent argument was limited to the black-eye injuries. Thus, this claim\\nalso can be reviewed only for plain error. See Payne, 313 Ga. at 221 (1).\\n       Sconyers argues that Lincoln’s jealousy was not admissible as “other act”\\nevidence under Rule 404 (b) because it was not an act at all, and also because\\nit was not relevant. But even if evidence of jealousy was not an “act” for\\npurposes of Rule 404 (b), it could be admissible as relevant evidence of the\\nnature of Sconyers’s poor relationship with Lincoln. See Shellman v. State, \\n318\\nGa. 71\\n, 77-78 (\\n897 SE2d 355\\n) (2024) (holding that evidence of the relationship\\nbetween the defendant and the victim, including jealousy, was relevant\\nbecause it shed light on the defendant’s motive in committing the charged\\noffenses). Rule 404 (b) is a “rule of inclusion,” State v. Jones, \\n297 Ga. 156\\n, 159\\n(2) (\\n773 SE2d 170\\n) (2015), so the fact that evidence may not be admissible\\nunder that rule does not mean that the rule excludes the evidence.\\n       Sconyers also argues generally that none of his prior difficulties with\\nLincoln were relevant except in a generic fashion to show motive. But evidence\\nof a defendant’s prior acts is ordinarily admissible in evidence under Rule 404\\n(b) “when the defendant is accused of a criminal act against that person, where\\nthe nature of the relationship between the defendant and the victim sheds light\\non the defendant’s motive in committing the offense charged.” Lowe v. State,\\n314 Ga. 788\\n, 793 (2) (a) (\\n879 SE2d 492\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation\\nomitted). Sconyers additionally contends that the prior-act evidence was not\\nadmissible under Rule 404 (b) because there was insufficient evidence to prove\\nthat he committed the acts. In his view, all of the evidence that he committed\\nthe prior acts was inadmissible hearsay from Finch’s co-workers. But as we\\nexplain more fully in Division 3, Sconyers did not object to the co-workers’\\ntestimony. By statute, “if a party does not properly object to hearsay, the\\nobjection shall be deemed waived, and the hearsay evidence shall be legal\\nevidence and admissible.” OCGA § 24-8-802. Sconyers has failed to show that\\n\\n                                       15\\n       2. Sconyers contends that the trial court erred when it\\n\\ninstructed the jury about “prior difficulties” between Sconyers and\\n\\nLincoln. The trial court instructed the jury as follows:\\n\\n           Evidence of prior difficulties between the defendant\\n      and the alleged victim, Lincoln Davitte, has been\\n      admitted for the sole purpose of illustrating, if it does, the\\n      state of feeling between the defendant and the alleged\\n      victim.\\n           Whether this evidence illustrates such matters is a\\n      matter solely for you, the jury, to determine, but you are\\n      not to consider such evidence for any other purpose.\\n\\nSconyers argues that this instruction failed to provide any limitation\\n\\nas to what evidence was subject to it, that the instruction improperly\\n\\nassumed there had been evidence of prior difficulties perpetrated by\\n\\nSconyers against Lincoln, and that the instruction did not define\\n\\n“state of feeling” even though that was the only determination the\\n\\ninstruction left to the jury and would naturally be inferred by the\\n\\njury. Although Sconyers objected to this instruction during the\\n\\ncharge conference, he did not object to it on any ground after the jury\\n\\n\\n\\nit is obvious beyond reasonable dispute that if he had properly objected under\\nRule 404 (b), the trial court would have abused its discretion in finding that\\nthe prior difficulties evidence met the requirements of that rule. Accordingly,\\nadmission of the prior difficulties into evidence does not amount to plain error.\\n                                       16\\n was charged. Thus, Sconyers did not properly preserve any of his\\n\\nclaims, and, indeed, he acknowledges that the instruction on prior\\n\\ndifficulties is subject to review for plain error only. See OCGA § 17-\\n\\n8-58 (b); Rawls, 310 Ga. at 217-218 (4). We see no plain error.\\n\\n      All of the language in the instruction on prior difficulties that\\n\\nSconyers now questions “was and is consistent with Georgia’s\\n\\npattern jury instructions[,] and [Sconyers] has not otherwise shown\\n\\nthat there was plain error.” Taylor v. State, \\n306 Ga. 277\\n, 286-287 (3)\\n\\n(c) (\\n830 SE2d 90\\n) (2019).5 Sconyers has pointed to no controlling\\n\\nprecedent holding that a trial court erred in connection with the\\n\\npattern charge on prior difficulties. See McKibbins v. State, \\n293 Ga.\\n\\n843\\n, 853 (7) (\\n750 SE2d 314\\n) (2013) (seeing no plain error where the\\n\\n\\n      5 See also Dyal v. State, \\n297 Ga. 184\\n, 188 (5) & n.9 (\\n773 SE2d 249\\n) (2015)\\n\\n(similar holding with respect to a previous version of the pattern jury\\ninstruction on prior difficulties, also setting out the current version that was\\napplicable at the time of Sconyers’s trial); Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions,\\nVol. II: Criminal Cases, § 1.34.20 (4th ed. 2007, updated Aug. 2022) (“Evidence\\nof prior difficulties (or lack thereof) between the defendant and (the alleged\\nvictim) (a witness) has been admitted for the sole purpose of illustrating, if it\\ndoes, the state of feeling between the defendant and the (alleged victim)\\n(witness); (the reasonableness of any alleged fears by defendant or alleged\\nvictim). Whether this evidence illustrates such matters is a matter solely for\\nyou, the jury, to determine, but you are not to consider such evidence for any\\nother purpose.”).\\n                                       17\\n appellant pointed to no decision that failing to define “accomplice”\\n\\nin the pattern charge on accomplice testimony was error). More\\n\\nspecifically, there has been no requirement that the trial court\\n\\ndefine “state of feeling.” See id. at 854 (7) (“[A] trial court is not\\n\\nrequired to instruct on the meaning of all words used in the charge,\\n\\nparticularly words of common understanding.” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)). Sconyers has cited no authority that the\\n\\ninstruction at issue improperly recognizes that some evidence of\\n\\nprior difficulties had been admitted. And there is no authority\\n\\nrequiring a trial court to specify what evidence qualifies as prior\\n\\ndifficulties. See Chester v. State, \\n267 Ga. 9\\n, 12 (2) (\\n471 SE2d 836\\n)\\n\\n(1996) (holding that a trial court is not required to specifically point\\n\\nout particular evidence to which an instruction applies and that a\\n\\ntrial court should refuse to give jury charges that “are more adjusted\\n\\nto the exhortation of counsel than to the impartial clarity which\\n\\nshould characterize the instructions of the court” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)); see also Collins v. State, \\n312 Ga. 727\\n, 743 (7)\\n\\nn.15 (\\n864 SE2d 85\\n) (2021) (same). Because the instruction on prior\\n\\n                                  18\\n difficulties “did not involve a clear departure from a settled legal\\n\\nrule,” it did not amount to plain error. McKibbins, \\n293 Ga. at 854\\n\\n\\n(7).\\n\\n       3. Sconyers contends that the trial court erred by admitting\\n\\ntestimony about alleged hearsay statements made by Finch about\\n\\nSconyers’s and Lincoln’s arguing, and about Sconyers hitting\\n\\nLincoln. Sconyers argues that the State violated the requirement of\\n\\nOCGA § 24-6-613 (b) (“Rule 613 (b)”) that, before extrinsic evidence\\n\\nof a prior inconsistent statement can be admitted into evidence, the\\n\\nwitness must be “first afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the\\n\\nprior inconsistent statement.” However, because Sconyers failed to\\n\\nobject to the testimony at issue on any ground, he acknowledges that\\n\\nthis enumeration can be reviewed for plain error only. See OCGA §\\n\\n24-1-103 (a) (1); Payne, 313 Ga. at 221 (1).6 We see no error, much\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       6 See also Harvey v.

Another co-worker of Finch’s,\\n\\nSera Druelle, testified that Finch showed Druelle a photo where one\\n\\nof Lincoln’s eyes was swollen shut and attributed the injury to the\\n\\nsleepwalking. According to Druelle, Finch had never said anything\\n\\nabout Lincoln having behavioral issues until, about a week or a week\\n\\nand a half before the fatal incident, Finch said that she thought\\n\\nSconyers’s “true colors were starting to come out”; that when he was\\n\\ntrying to pick up Lincoln at the mall, Lincoln “got upset and started\\n\\npointing at [Sconyers], and Lincoln started hitting his own face,” and\\n\\nFinch “turned around and said [to Sconyers] did you hit him?”; and\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 20\\n that Lincoln “would have behavioral issues around [Sconyers].” 7\\n\\n     Finch testified at trial that she took Lincoln to counseling,\\n\\nwhich his doctor recommended in December 2018, because he had\\n\\ndeveloped “jealousy issues” with Sconyers. Finch also testified that\\n\\nshe and Sconyers were engaged at the time of trial and that she did\\n\\nnot believe that he injured Lincoln in any way. She denied that she\\n\\nremembered ever discussing with any of her co-workers that\\n\\nSconyers and Lincoln had been fighting. Finch also denied that there\\n\\nwas ever an incident at a mall when Lincoln indicated Sconyers had\\n\\nhit him and that she ever asked Sconyers if he had hit Lincoln\\n\\nbecause she and Sconyers were “always together.” Finch further\\n\\ndenied that she ever had any apprehensions about her relationship\\n\\nwith Sconyers or that Sconyers had a temper or argued with Lincoln.\\n\\nInstead, Finch testified, Sconyers and Lincoln “just played like\\n\\nfather and son.” Finch subsequently denied ever discussing with her\\n\\nco-workers the nature of her relationship with Sconyers. On cross-\\n\\n\\n     7  The DFCS employee also testified about a private interview with\\nLincoln’s sister, who said that Sconyers would spank Lincoln because he was\\ncrying.\\n                                    21\\n examination, Finch also denied ever telling anyone she worked with\\n\\nthat Sconyers “abuses Lincoln or anything like that”; she asserted\\n\\nthat she “wasn’t close with anybody in the office” and that she “really\\n\\nkept [her] personal stuff to [her]self.”\\n\\n     “[P]rior inconsistent statements that meet the requirements of\\n\\n[Rule ]613 (b) are not hearsay if the declarant testifies at trial and\\n\\nis subject to cross-examination. See OCGA § 24-8-801 (d) (1) (A).”\\n\\nNeloms v. State, \\n313 Ga. 781\\n, 787 (4) (a) (\\n873 SE2d 125\\n) (2022). “The\\n\\nfailure of a witness to remember making a statement, like the\\n\\nwitness’s flat denial of the statement, may provide the foundation\\n\\nfor calling another witness to prove that the statement was made.”\\n\\nId.\\n (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, Finch’s denials and alleged lack of memory of her prior\\n\\nstatements and their contents were a sufficient foundation to allow\\n\\nother witnesses to testify about the content of those statements, that\\n\\nis, the arguing and the hitting. See Neloms, 313 Ga. at 788 (4) (b);\\n\\nBridgewater v. State, \\n309 Ga. 882\\n, 886-887 (2) (\\n848 SE2d 865\\n) (2020)\\n\\n(One witness’s “unambiguous denial that he had ever spoken with\\n\\n                                   22\\n [a second witness]—as well as his assertion that he did not recall\\n\\never speaking with him—obviated the need for the prosecutor to ask\\n\\n[the first witness] about specific statements he made to [the second\\n\\nwitness] and provided sufficient foundation for the State to present\\n\\nextrinsic evidence of such statements.”); Murdock v.

But as Bridgewater and Murdock indicate, Finch’s\\n\\nfailure to recall making any statement at all about fighting, abuse,\\n\\nor anything like that, as well as her denial of the mall incident and\\n\\nSconyers arguing with Lincoln, relieved the prosecutor of the need\\n\\nto ask about specific statements. Moreover, at the prosecutor’s\\n\\nrequest, the trial court directed Finch to remain subject to recall and\\n\\nthe rule of sequestration. See Wammock v.

Sconyers contends that the trial court erred by permitting\\n\\nthe prosecution to impeach Finch with alleged bias through the\\n\\ntestimony of Leslie Morgan, who was the guardian ad litem\\n\\nappointed in Finch’s case in juvenile court involving her daughter’s\\n\\n                                     24\\n custody and visitation. We see no error.\\n\\n     During her direct examination, Finch testified that her\\n\\ndaughter had not been in her custody since Lincoln’s death and that\\n\\nshe was not offered any opportunity to be able to see her daughter\\n\\non a more regular basis, nor any type of visitation by the juvenile\\n\\ncourt. Morgan later testified that Finch was offered the opportunity\\n\\nto have a visitation plan with her daughter, but that it was not ever\\n\\naccomplished. Morgan explained that she was part of a conference\\n\\ncall with the juvenile court judge and two others, during which an\\n\\nagreement was reached that the child’s therapist would help\\n\\nfacilitate a supervised visit on the condition that Finch would sign\\n\\nan affidavit that she is no longer seeing or dating Sconyers, but\\n\\nFinch never executed the affidavit. On cross-examination, Morgan\\n\\nagreed that neither Finch nor her attorney was on the conference\\n\\ncall, but she named someone from the office of Finch’s attorney as\\n\\nbeing on the call. Although Finch was aware that there was going to\\n\\nbe a conference call addressing visitation, Morgan was not sure what\\n\\nFinch’s attorney told her after the call.\\n\\n                                  25\\n      Sconyers objects to Morgan’s testimony on two bases. First, he\\n\\ncontends that her testimony was not based on personal knowledge\\n\\nand therefore was not admissible under OCGA § 24-6-602 (“Rule\\n\\n602”). Second, he contends that her testimony did not establish a\\n\\nspecific instance of Finch’s conduct showing that she was biased in\\n\\nfavor of Sconyers, and therefore was not admissible to show her\\n\\ncharacter for untruthfulness under OCGA § 24-6-608 (b) (“Rule 608\\n\\n(b)”). Because Sconyers raised only the Rule 608 (b) objection at trial,\\n\\nwe review his Rule 602 argument only for plain error. See OCGA §\\n\\n24-1-103 (a) (1); Henderson, 317 Ga. at 78 (4) (c). 8 We address the\\n\\narguments in turn.\\n\\n     (a) Rule 602 generally prohibits a witness from testifying “to a\\n\\nmatter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding\\n\\nthat the witness has personal knowledge of such matter. Evidence\\n\\nto prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     8 See also Brown v. State, \\n314 Ga. 193\\n, 199 (3) (\\n875 SE2d 784\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(Because the appellant did not object to certain testimony on the ground that\\nthe witnesses lacked personal knowledge so as to preserve ordinary appellate\\nreview on that issue, it could be reviewed only for plain error.).\\n                                     26\\n witness’s own testimony.” Under that rule, as under the\\n\\ncorresponding federal rule, “witnesses may testify about events they\\n\\npersonally observed.” Draughn v. State, \\n311 Ga. 378\\n, 385 (4) (\\n858\\n\\nSE2d 8\\n) (2021). But “a court should exclude testimony for lack of\\n\\npersonal knowledge if the witness could not have actually perceived\\n\\nor observed that which he testifies to.” Kirby v. State, \\n304 Ga. 472\\n,\\n\\n478 (3) (b) (\\n819 SE2d 468\\n) (2018) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Morgan’s testimony made clear the limit of her personal\\n\\nknowledge,   i.e., that her knowledge of Finch’s          unfulfilled\\n\\nopportunity for a visitation plan with her daughter was based\\n\\nentirely on a conference call in which someone from the office of\\n\\nFinch’s attorney participated. Morgan did not state an opinion or\\n\\ninference about Finch’s knowledge or actions. To the contrary,\\n\\nMorgan’s testimony was “not impermissible opinion testimony” but\\n\\nwas “straightforward factual testimony regarding matters within\\n\\n[her] personal knowledge,” Cooper v. State, \\n317 Ga. 676\\n, 685 (2) (\\n895\\n\\nSE2d 285\\n) (2023), only about what she “actually perceived,” Kirby,\\n\\n304 Ga. at 478\\n (3) (b). Thus, we see no violation of Rule 602, much\\n\\n                                 27\\n less a violation that is obvious beyond reasonable dispute.\\n\\n     (b) Rule 608 (b) generally prohibits proof by extrinsic evidence\\n\\nof “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of\\n\\nattacking or supporting the witness’s character for truthfulness,”\\n\\nexcept for a conviction of a crime as provided in OCGA § 24-6-609 or\\n\\n“conduct indicative of the witness’s bias toward a party.” Sconyers’s\\n\\nargument about what Morgan’s testimony proved goes to its\\n\\nrelevance to meet the exception in Rule 608 (b) for “conduct\\n\\nindicative of the witness’s bias toward a party.” The value of\\n\\nMorgan’s testimony lay in its tendency both to disprove Finch’s\\n\\ntestimony denying any offer or opportunity for visitation and to\\n\\nprove bias on her part in favor of Sconyers. See OCGA § 24-4-401\\n\\n(“Rule 401”) (defining “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any\\n\\ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to\\n\\nthe determination of the action more probable or less probable than\\n\\nit would be without the evidence”). Morgan’s testimony – that Finch\\n\\nknew about the conference call and her attorney had a\\n\\nrepresentative on the call – permitted the natural, reasonable\\n\\n                                  28\\n inference that Morgan accurately reported the substance of the\\n\\nconference call in which she participated in her official role as\\n\\nguardian ad litem, that Finch’s attorney performed her duty to\\n\\nascertain what happened on the call and inform Finch of the\\n\\nvisitation offer, and that Finch therefore was offered and declined a\\n\\nvisitation plan if she stopped seeing Sconyers. In other words,\\n\\nMorgan’s testimony established that – contrary to Finch’s own\\n\\ntestimony – Finch was offered a visitation plan with her older\\n\\ndaughter, but declined to go along with that plan because it required\\n\\nher to stop seeing Sconyers. See Fitts v. State, \\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 142 (3)\\n\\n(\\n859 SE2d 79\\n) (2021) (“When considering circumstantial evidence,\\n\\njurors are entitled to draw reasonable inferences based on their own\\n\\ncommon-sense understanding of the world that are ordinarily drawn\\n\\nby ordinary people in the light of their experience in everyday life.”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     In its ruling, the trial court properly relied on OCGA § 24-6-\\n\\n621 (“Rule 621”), which provides that “[a] witness may be impeached\\n\\nby disproving the facts testified to by the witness.” It is true that\\n\\n                                 29\\n this statute does not authorize the use of “extrinsic evidence to\\n\\nimpeach a witness by contradiction” on a matter that is “wholly\\n\\nimmaterial” or “purely collateral” to the material issues at trial.\\n\\nScott v. State, \\n309 Ga. 764\\n, 770-771 (3) (c) (\\n848 SE2d 448\\n) (2020).9\\n\\nBut the nature and depth of Finch’s relationship with Sconyers was\\n\\nrelevant to the jury’s assessment of the material issue of her\\n\\npotential bias. See McNabb v. State, \\n313 Ga. 701\\n, 715 (2) (b) (i) (\\n872\\n\\nSE2d 251\\n) (2020) (“[T]he nature of the relationships between the\\n\\nwitnesses and defendants was relevant, as the jury’s understanding\\n\\nof a familial relationship between a defendant and a witness could\\n\\naffect the jury’s assessment of the witness’s credibility or potential\\n\\nbias    and   provide     context    for   the   witness’s     testimony.”).10\\n\\nConsequently, it was within the trial court’s discretion to admit\\n\\n\\n       9 Scott properly relied on case law under former OCGA § 24-9-82, in\\n\\naddition to current Rule 621, because that current rule was carried over from\\nthe old Evidence Code and has no federal corollary.\\n      10 See also OCGA § 24-6-622 (“Rule 622”) (“The state of a witness’s\\n\\nfeelings towards the parties and the witness’s relationship to the parties may\\nalways be proved for the consideration of the jury.”); Virger v.

ANDERSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PINSON, Justice.\\n\\n        Clark Chandler Anderson shot and killed Kevin Murr. At trial,\\n\\nAnderson argued the killing was voluntary manslaughter, not\\n\\nmurder, because he shot Murr after being seriously provoked, but\\n\\nthe jury found Anderson guilty of malice murder. On appeal,\\n\\nAnderson contends that insufficient evidence supported his\\n\\nconvictions, that the trial court should have given Anderson’s\\n\\nrequested jury instruction about voluntary manslaughter, and that\\n\\nhis trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to three pieces of\\n\\ntestimony from his coworkers that, in Anderson’s view, were\\n\\ninadmissible character evidence.\\n\\n        We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support\\n\\nAnderson’s conviction for malice murder because it showed that he\\n intentionally shot Murr 16 times. We further conclude that no jury\\n\\ninstruction about voluntary manslaughter was required because the\\n\\nprovocation that Anderson claims—Murr yelling and cursing at him\\n\\nand threatening to get a gun—was not enough to excite the “sudden,\\n\\nviolent, and irresistible passion” that could warrant a jury\\n\\ninstruction on voluntary manslaughter. And counsel was not\\n\\nineffective for failing to object to the coworkers’ testimony: counsel\\n\\nwanted the jury to hear some of the testimony because it would serve\\n\\ncounsel’s strategy of trying to evoke the jury’s sympathy, and\\n\\nAnderson suffered no prejudice from the remaining testimony. So\\n\\nwe affirm Anderson’s convictions.\\n\\n      1. Anderson was convicted of malice murder and other crimes\\n\\nin connection with the shooting death of Murr. 1 The evidence at trial\\n\\n\\n      1 The shooting occurred on June 7, 2020. On October 28, 2020, a Paulding\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Anderson for malice murder, felony murder\\npredicated on aggravated assault, aggravated assault of Murr, aggravated\\nassault of Carol Anderson, and possession of a firearm during the commission\\nof a felony. He was tried by a jury from June 6 to 8, 2022. The jury found\\nAnderson not guilty of the aggravated assault of Carol Anderson but guilty of\\nthe remaining charges. He was sentenced to life in prison without the\\npossibility of parole for malice murder, with a consecutive term of five years in\\nprison for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The\\n\\n                                       2\\n showed the following.\\n\\n      Anderson lived with his mother, Carol, and Carol’s fiancé,\\n\\nMurr. Carol and Murr had been together for nine and a half years,\\n\\nand Carol and Anderson had moved in with Murr about a year before\\n\\nthe shooting. Carol described Anderson and Murr’s relationship as\\n\\n“generally good,” although she acknowledged that Anderson “was a\\n\\nlittle distrustful” and that the two “were both a little back and forth\\n\\nsometimes.”\\n\\n      Anderson and Murr’s relationship grew more fraught a few\\n\\nmonths before the shooting. Starting around that time, Anderson\\n\\ndescribed Murr to coworkers as an “evil piece of s**t” and said he\\n\\nhated Murr and wanted to kill him. In Anderson’s text messages to\\n\\na coworker from about three months before the shooting, which were\\n\\nread to the jury, Anderson said he would probably kill Murr “and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nremaining counts were merged or vacated by operation of law. Anderson filed\\na timely motion for new trial, which he later amended through new counsel.\\nAfter a hearing and supplemental briefing, the trial court denied the motion\\nfor new trial, as amended, on October 23, 2023. Anderson filed a timely notice\\nof appeal. His case was docketed to the term of Court beginning in December\\n2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                      3\\n shoot it out with the cops,” and that killing Murr would be “easier\\n\\nthan killing [an] ISIS or Taliban solider.”\\n\\n     On the morning of the shooting, Anderson left the house early\\n\\nto go to work. Murr and Carol stayed home all day. When Anderson\\n\\nreturned home in the evening, he said he was tired and went to his\\n\\nroom.\\n\\n     A little later, Murr angrily went to Anderson’s closed bedroom\\n\\ndoor. He began “banging on the door,” “screaming,” and “yelling” at\\n\\nAnderson to come out and take a shower. Anderson—who had not\\n\\nshowered for “upwards to about a month”—responded repeatedly\\n\\nthat he would do it in the morning. During this commotion, Carol\\n\\ncame out from the main bedroom into the hallway to see what the\\n\\ntrouble was. Murr told her to “get the F back in there,” but Carol\\n\\nremained in the hall.\\n\\n     Suddenly things grew “eerily quiet.” Carol and Murr heard a\\n\\nclicking from inside Anderson’s room, which they recognized as the\\n\\nsound of his gun. Ordinarily Carol and Murr would “roll [their] eyes”\\n\\nwhen they heard that clicking sound, because they knew Anderson\\n\\n                                  4\\n was just playing with the gun. But this time it “felt different . . .\\n\\nbecause of the yelling” that had just happened.\\n\\n     Shots rang out. Murr was hit through the closed door. Other\\n\\nbullets hit the wall near where Carol was standing. Murr screamed\\n\\nout, “GD you hit me,” and ran towards the kitchen. Carol followed.\\n\\nAnderson emerged from his room and, in his own words, “kept\\n\\nshooting” at Murr until his gun was empty—16 rounds in all. Murr\\n\\nreached the kitchen and fell to the floor. He died soon after.\\n\\n     Murr had been hit five times in the chest and back. The bullets,\\n\\nbullet holes, and spent shell casings found around his body\\n\\nsuggested that Anderson had fired some of those shots after Murr\\n\\nwas on the ground. Nevertheless, Carol testified that Anderson\\n\\nperformed CPR on Murr, to no avail, and that Anderson said, “Oh,\\n\\nGod, what have I done, what have I done, oh, F, what have I done .\\n\\n. . mom, I’m sorry, mom, I’m sorry, God, I’m sorry.” Carol,\\n\\nmeanwhile, called 9-1-1.\\n\\n     Sheriff’s deputies arrived at the scene. The first responding\\n\\nofficer found Anderson and Carol on the front steps of the house.\\n\\n                                  5\\n Anderson’s hands were covered in blood. He told the officer he had\\n\\nshot Murr multiple times with a handgun.\\n\\n     Police took Anderson to the sheriff’s office. There, Anderson\\n\\nwaived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (86 SCt\\n\\n1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966), and gave a recorded statement, portions\\n\\nof which were played for the jury. In the statement, Anderson\\n\\nadmitted that he shot Murr. He said repeatedly that he was not\\n\\nangry at Murr and did not lose his temper, but rather feared for\\n\\nhimself and his mother because Murr had threatened to get his own\\n\\ngun. According to Anderson, when Murr was pounding on the\\n\\nbedroom door, Anderson “racked the slide [of his gun] as a\\n\\ndeterrent.” Despite that deterrent, Murr eventually broke through\\n\\nthe locked door. Anderson then pushed the door closed and shot\\n\\nMurr through the closed door.\\n\\n     At least one part of Anderson’s statement was undercut by\\n\\nother trial evidence. Although Anderson claimed that Murr had\\n\\nbroken through the locked bedroom door, an officer testified that the\\n\\ndoor was undamaged—except for the bullet holes.\\n\\n                                 6\\n      2. Anderson contends that the evidence at trial was not\\n\\nsufficient as a matter of constitutional due process to support his\\n\\nconviction for malice murder. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\\n\\n319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). “We evaluate a due\\n\\nprocess challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by viewing the\\n\\nevidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the\\n\\nverdicts, and asking whether any rational trier of fact could have\\n\\nfound the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes\\n\\nof which he was convicted.” Henderson v. State, 317 Ga. 66, 72 (2)\\n\\n(891 SE2d 884) (2023). “We leave to the jury the resolution of\\n\\nconflicts or inconsistencies in the evidence, credibility of witnesses,\\n\\nand reasonable inferences to be derived from the facts.” Perkins v.\\n\\nState, 313 Ga. 885, 891 (2) (a) (873 SE2d 185) (2022) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Under that standard, the evidence at Anderson’s trial was\\n\\nsufficient to sustain his malice murder conviction. A person is guilty\\n\\nof malice murder if “he unlawfully and with malice aforethought,\\n\\neither express or implied, causes the death of another human being.”\\n\\n                                  7\\n OCGA § 16-5-1 (a). At Anderson’s trial, it was undisputed that\\n\\nAnderson shot Murr. Not only that, but he shot him multiple times,\\n\\npursued him to the kitchen, and continued firing until the gun was\\n\\nempty. Although Anderson had told police that he shot Murr out of\\n\\nfear, he never asserted an affirmative defense of justification, asked\\n\\nfor a jury instruction on self-defense, or otherwise claimed at trial\\n\\nthat he shot Murr in self-defense. To the contrary, the evidence\\n\\nshowed that in the months leading up to the shooting, Anderson had\\n\\ntold his colleagues that he hated Murr and fantasized about killing\\n\\nhim. Presented with that evidence and the evidence at trial and\\n\\nrecounted in part above, a reasonable jury could find beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt Anderson killed Murr with malice aforethought.\\n\\nSee Neason v. State, 317 Ga. 695, 698-699 (895 SE2d 278) (2023)\\n\\n(evidence sufficient to support malice murder conviction when\\n\\nmultiple witnesses saw defendant shoot victim and defendant had\\n\\nmotive to kill victim); Whittaker v. State, 317 Ga. 127, 131 (2) (891\\n\\nSE2d 849) (2023) (evidence sufficient to support malice murder\\n\\nconviction when defendant stabbed victim 50 times and strangled\\n\\n                                  8\\n him, because defendant’s “brutal and excessive actions . . .\\n\\nsupport[ed] the jury’s finding of the requisite malice and intent”).\\n\\n     Anderson contends on appeal that he “raised an affirmative\\n\\ndefense” that the killing was voluntary manslaughter, rather than\\n\\nmurder, because he “committed this crime out of a sudden, violent,\\n\\nand irresistible passion,” and that the State failed to disprove that\\n\\ndefense beyond a reasonable doubt. But voluntary manslaughter is\\n\\na separate offense, not an affirmative defense to murder, so the\\n\\nState was not required to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. See\\n\\nOCGA §§ 16-3-20 to 16-3-28 (listing affirmative defenses); Wyman v.\\n\\nState, 278 Ga. 339, 340-341 (3) (602 SE2d 619) (2004) (voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter is not a defense to murder); cf. Clark v. State, 307 Ga.\\n\\n537, 539-540 (1) (837 SE2d 265) (2019) (“When a defendant raises\\n\\nan affirmative defense that is supported by some evidence, the State\\n\\nhas the burden of disproving that defense beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt.”). And as explained in Division 4, no evidence supported a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter conviction in any event.\\n\\n     3. Anderson also argues that this Court should reverse his\\n\\n                                  9\\n conviction under the “general grounds” in OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-\\n\\n21. Those Code sections allow a trial court, on a motion for new trial,\\n\\nto reverse a conviction if the conviction is “contrary to evidence and\\n\\nthe principles of justice and equity,” OCGA § 5-5-20, or “decidedly\\n\\nand strongly against the weight of the evidence,” OCGA § 5-5-21.\\n\\nBut when we determine that the trial court has exercised its\\n\\ndiscretion under OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, we do not review the\\n\\nmerits of the general grounds on appeal. The decision whether to\\n\\nreverse a conviction on the general grounds is left to the sole\\n\\ndiscretion of the trial court. See, e.g., Adams v. State, 318 Ga. 105,\\n\\n114 (2) (897 SE2d 396) (2024); King v. State, 316 Ga. 611, 616 (2)\\n\\n(889 SE2d 851) (2023); Ridley v. State, 315 Ga. 452, 456 (3) (883\\n\\nSE2d 357) (2023); Bundel v. State, 308 Ga. 317, 318 (1) (840 SE2d\\n\\n349) (2020); Strother v. State, 305 Ga. 838, 843 (3) (828 SE2d 327)\\n\\n(2019). Here, the trial court noted that it “ha[d] considered but\\n\\ndecline[d] to grant a new trial under the general grounds.” Absent\\n\\naffirmative evidence to the contrary—and there is none here—we\\n\\npresume that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in\\n\\n                                  10\\n denying a motion for new trial on the general grounds. 2 See, e.g.,\\n\\nWard v. State, 316 Ga. 295, 299 (3) (888 SE2d 75) (2023).\\n\\n      Separately, Anderson contends that his conviction should be\\n\\nreversed under OCGA § 5-5-25, which allows a court to grant a new\\n\\ntrial “on other grounds not provided for in this Code” if the court\\n\\nfinds that relief is required “according to the provisions of the\\n\\ncommon law and practice of the courts.” But Anderson does not point\\n\\nto any “other grounds” or support his contention with argument or\\n\\nexplanation. “[T]his Court is not required to scour the record for\\n\\nsupport for an appellant’s arguments,” Davis v. State, 306 Ga. 140,\\n\\n144 (3) (829 SE2d 321) (2019), and we decline to do so here. So\\n\\nAnderson’s claim on this ground also fails.\\n\\n      4. Anderson contends that the trial court erred by refusing to\\n\\n\\n      2 In the past, when evaluating a trial court’s denial of a motion for new\\n\\ntrial on the general grounds, we have sometimes reviewed the sufficiency of\\nthe evidence as a matter of constitutional due process under Jackson, 443 U.S.\\n307. See, e.g., Montgomery v. State, 315 Ga. 467, 474 (3) (883 SE2d 351) (2023).\\nMany of us “question whether it is proper for this Court to import Jackson into\\nan appellate review of the general grounds.” King, 316 Ga. at 616 (2) n.8. But\\nwe need not resolve that question here, because Anderson’s general-grounds\\nclaim fails in any event: the trial court exercised its discretion to deny the\\nclaim, and, as we explained above, the evidence was constitutionally sufficient\\nto affirm Anderson’s convictions. See id.\\n                                      11\\n give his requested jury instruction about voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\nVoluntary manslaughter is the killing of another person, “under\\n\\ncircumstances which would otherwise be murder,” where the\\n\\nperpetrator “acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and\\n\\nirresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient to\\n\\nexcite such passion in a reasonable person.” OCGA § 16-5-2 (a).\\n\\nWhen a defendant requests a jury instruction on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter, as Anderson did here, the trial court must give the\\n\\ninstruction if there is “slight evidence” to support it—that is, if there\\n\\nis slight evidence that the defendant, in killing the victim, acted\\n\\nunder a “serious provocation” that could excite a “sudden, violent,\\n\\nand irresistible passion” in a reasonable person. See Mobley v. State,\\n\\n314 Ga. 38, 42 (875 SE2d 655) (2022) (citations and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). The existence, or not, of that “slight evidence” is a question\\n\\nof law. See id. at 42-43. And when, as here, a defendant properly\\n\\npreserves a claim that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct\\n\\nthe jury on an applicable principle of law, that claim is reviewed de\\n\\nnovo. See Eubanks v. State, 317 Ga. 563, 581 (3) (b) (894 SE2d 27)\\n\\n                                   12\\n (2023).\\n\\n     The trial court here did not err in refusing to give a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter instruction because no evidence supported giving one.\\n\\nAnderson contends that he was seriously provoked by Murr\\n\\npounding on the door, yelling and cursing at him, and threatening\\n\\nto get a gun. But threats and insults on their own are not enough to\\n\\nsupport a voluntary manslaughter instruction. See, e.g., Smith v.\\n\\nState, 296 Ga. 731, 737 (3) (770 SE2d 610) (2015) (“[N]either fear\\n\\nthat someone is going to pull a gun nor fighting are the types of\\n\\nprovocation which demand a voluntary manslaughter charge.”);\\n\\nRountree v. State, 316 Ga. 691, 694-695 (2) (889 SE2d 803) (2023)\\n\\n(“threatening words and racial epithets” did not amount to serious\\n\\nprovocation, “no matter how menacing or offensive they were” to the\\n\\ndefendant); Hudson v. State, 308 Ga. 443, 446 (2) (a) (841 SE2d 696)\\n\\n(2020) (voluntary manslaughter instruction not required where\\n\\nvictim used crude and insulting language toward defendant,\\n\\nbecause “[t]here was no evidence whatsoever of provocation\\n\\nsufficient to excite the passions of a reasonable person”). Here, the\\n\\n                                 13\\n evidence was that Murr yelled and cursed at Anderson, told him to\\n\\ntake a shower, and threatened to get his gun. Those threats and\\n\\ninsults, no matter how offensive to Anderson, did not subject him to\\n\\na provocation that would reduce his crime from murder to voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. See Smith, 296 Ga. at 737 (3). The trial court thus\\n\\ndid not err in declining to give the instruction. See Hudson, 308 Ga.\\n\\nat 446 (2) (a).\\n\\n     Anderson also contends the trial court was required to give a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter instruction because it was his “sole\\n\\ndefense” at trial. See Price v. State, 289 Ga. 459, 459-460 (2) (712\\n\\nSE2d 828) (2011) (“The trial court must charge the jury on the\\n\\ndefendant’s sole defense, even without a written request, if there is\\n\\nsome evidence to support the charge.”) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). But voluntary manslaughter is a distinct offense, not a\\n\\ndefense to murder. See Wyman, 278 Ga. at 340-341 (3). And in any\\n\\nevent, as discussed above, no evidence supported the charge. See\\n\\nPrice, 289 Ga. at 459 (2).\\n\\n     5. Anderson contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective\\n\\n                                 14\\n assistance by failing to object to certain testimony from Anderson’s\\n\\ncoworkers. In Anderson’s view, that testimony was character\\n\\nevidence that would have been excluded under OCGA §§ 24-4-404\\n\\n(a) and 24-4-405 (a) had his counsel objected. See OCGA § 24-4-404\\n\\n(a) (“[e]vidence of a person’s character or a trait of character shall\\n\\nnot be admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity\\n\\ntherewith on a particular occasion,” subject to certain exceptions\\n\\nthat the State did not rely on here); OCGA § 24-4-405 (a) (requiring\\n\\nthat, whenever evidence of character is admissible, “proof shall be\\n\\nmade by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of\\n\\nan opinion”).\\n\\n     (a) Anderson identifies three pieces of testimony that he says\\n\\ncounsel should have tried to exclude. First, two of his coworkers\\n\\ntestified that he sometimes brought guns to work. Second, the same\\n\\ntwo coworkers testified that Anderson falsely claimed to have served\\n\\nin the military, with one recalling that Anderson said he suffered\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 15\\n from post-traumatic stress disorder.3 Finally, one coworker testified\\n\\nthat while she was giving Anderson a ride home from work a few\\n\\nweeks before the murder, she asked if Anderson wanted to move\\n\\nfrom the back seat of her car to the front seat, and he replied,\\n\\n“[W]hat do you think I’m going to rape you or something?”\\n\\n      At the hearing on Anderson’s motion for a new trial, trial\\n\\ncounsel was asked why he did not try to exclude the coworkers’\\n\\ntestimony about Anderson bringing guns to work or lying about\\n\\nmilitary service. (He was not asked why he did not try to exclude the\\n\\ntestimony about Anderson’s comment about rape.) In response,\\n\\ncounsel explained how the coworkers’ testimony served his trial\\n\\nstrategy of trying to gain the jury’s sympathy. Counsel recalled that\\n\\nAnderson, in a part of his recorded interview that the jury would\\n\\nsee, had talked about being too small in stature to join the police or\\n\\nthe military. Counsel said he played up that idea in his opening\\n\\n\\n      3 The witnesses did not explicitly characterize Anderson’s claims about\\n\\nmilitary service as untrue, but it was (and is) undisputed that Anderson never\\nserved. The State argued in closing that it was obviously untrue that Anderson\\nhad ever served in the military, and pointed out that his mother testified that\\nhe had never had another job.\\n                                      16\\n statement to argue that Anderson’s small stature had prevented\\n\\nhim from achieving his goals and left him frustrated. In counsel’s\\n\\nview, the challenged testimony from Anderson’s coworkers—that\\n\\nAnderson lied about military service and displayed guns at work—\\n\\nfit the same narrative. Counsel testified that he made a “strategic\\n\\ndecision to just let it all in and give the jury the full picture of what\\n\\nwas going on,” because Anderson’s “only real shot at anything” was\\n\\nto generate sympathy from the jury.\\n\\n     (b) To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a\\n\\ndefendant must show both that counsel’s performance was\\n\\nprofessionally deficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result.\\n\\nSee Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (III) (104 SCt 2052,\\n\\n80 LE2d 674) (1984); Washington v. State, 313 Ga. 771, 773 (3) (873\\n\\nSE2d 132) (2022). “If an appellant fails to meet his or her burden of\\n\\nproving either prong of the Strickland test, the reviewing court does\\n\\nnot have to examine the other prong.” Taylor v. State, 315 Ga. 630,\\n\\n647 (5) (b) (884 SE2d 346) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     To prove deficiency, a defendant “must show that his lawyer\\n\\n                                   17\\n performed his duties in an objectively unreasonable way,\\n\\nconsidering all the circumstances and in the light of prevailing\\n\\nprofessional norms.” Scott v. State, 317 Ga. 218, 221 (2) (892 SE2d\\n\\n744) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). This is “no easy\\n\\nshowing,” id. (citation and punctuation omitted), because the law\\n\\nrecognizes a “strong presumption that trial counsel’s conduct falls\\n\\nwithin the broad range of reasonable professional conduct,” Harper\\n\\nv. State, 318 Ga. 185, 192 (1) (897 SE2d 818) (2024) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). To overcome that presumption, the appellant\\n\\nmust show that “no reasonable lawyer would have done what his\\n\\nlawyer did, or would have failed to do what his lawyer did not.”\\n\\nWashington, 313 Ga. at 773 (3) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n“In particular, decisions regarding trial tactics and strategy may\\n\\nform the basis for an ineffectiveness claim only if they were so\\n\\npatently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have\\n\\nfollowed such a course.” Waters v. State, 317 Ga. 822, 829 (3) (b) (896\\n\\nSE2d 507) (2023) (citation and punctuation).\\n\\n     To show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient\\n\\n                                  18\\n performance, a defendant must show that, but for the deficiency,\\n\\nthere was a “reasonable probability” that the result of the trial\\n\\nwould have been different. See Waters, 317 Ga. at 829 (3) (b). “A\\n\\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\\n\\nconfidence in the outcome.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     With these standards in mind, we review in turn each piece of\\n\\ntestimony that Anderson contends his counsel should have tried to\\n\\nexclude.\\n\\n     (i) Counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to object to the\\n\\ncoworkers’ testimony about Anderson bringing guns to work and\\n\\nlying about military service. Counsel testified that his strategy at\\n\\ntrial—indeed, his “only real shot at anything”—was to play on the\\n\\njury’s sympathy in the hope that the jury would find that Anderson\\n\\nacted without malice. That strategy was reasonable under the\\n\\ncircumstances. See Earnest v. State, 262 Ga. 494, 496-497 (5) (422\\n\\nSE2d 188) (1992) (strategy of trying to invoke the jury’s sympathy\\n\\nis “within the range of professionally reasonable decisions”). Counsel\\n\\npursued his strategy by trying to give the jury “the full picture of\\n\\n                                  19\\n what was going on” with Anderson. For counsel, that meant\\n\\nportraying Anderson as a man whose small stature prevented him\\n\\nfrom joining the police or the military, and who may have\\n\\ncompensated for those frustrations by enacting fantasies of military\\n\\nservice around his coworkers. The coworkers’ testimony, especially\\n\\nlayered with Anderson’s own statements to police, helped complete\\n\\nthat “full picture.” So it was reasonable for counsel not to object to\\n\\nit. See Jones v. State, 300 Ga. 543, 546 (2) (a) (796 SE2d 659) (2017)\\n\\n(reasonable strategy not to object to evidence that “might be useful\\n\\nto create sympathy for the [defendants] and convince a jury that\\n\\nthey did not act with malice”).\\n\\n     Because counsel’s decision not to object was part of a\\n\\nreasonable trial strategy, it fell within the “broad range of\\n\\nreasonable professional conduct.” See Harper, 318 Ga. at 192 (1);\\n\\nWaters, 317 Ga. at 829 (3) (b); Jones, 300 Ga. at 546 (2) (a). The fact\\n\\nthat the strategy did not carry the day does not mean it was unsound\\n\\nor that counsel’s performance was deficient. See Grissom v. State,\\n\\n296 Ga. 406, 412 (4) (768 SE2d 494) (2015) (counsel’s strategic\\n\\n                                  20\\n decisions “must not be judged by hindsight or the ultimate result of\\n\\nthe trial”) (citation and punctuation omitted). So Anderson’s claim\\n\\nof ineffectiveness on this ground fails.\\n\\n     (ii) We turn next to the coworker’s testimony about Anderson’s\\n\\ncomment about rape. Counsel was not asked why he did not object\\n\\nto that testimony, so he never had a chance to explain (as he did\\n\\nwith the other challenged evidence) how it might fit into a trial\\n\\nstrategy. But even if no reasonable lawyer would have failed to\\n\\nobject to this testimony, its admission did not prejudice Anderson.\\n\\nAt trial, it was uncontested that Anderson shot Murr to death, that\\n\\nhe pursued him through the house while continuing to fire until the\\n\\ngun was empty, and that he had talked about killing Murr for\\n\\nmonths beforehand. Against that evidence, Anderson’s only defense\\n\\nwas that he was responding to Murr’s threats and insults. Given all\\n\\nthe jury heard about the brutality of the killing and about\\n\\nAnderson’s animus toward Murr, there is not a reasonable\\n\\nprobability that the outcome of the trial was affected by testimony\\n\\nthat Anderson once made a comment about rape to a coworker,\\n\\n                                  21\\n however unseemly or offensive it may have been. See Talley v. State,\\n\\n314 Ga. 153, 162-163 (3) (a) (875 SE2d 789) (2022) (defendant not\\n\\nprejudiced when counsel did not object to testimony about a threat\\n\\ndefendant had made, because while the threat “might have reflected\\n\\nnegatively on” the defendant, it was “not particularly disparaging of\\n\\n[his] character” when viewed in context and “given the strength of\\n\\nthe other admissible evidence against him”) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted); Gibbs v. State, 303 Ga. 681, 682-683 (1) (813\\n\\nSE2d 393) (2018) (defendant not prejudiced when counsel did not\\n\\nobject to testimony that arguably placed defendant’s character in\\n\\nissue, given strong evidence of defendant’s guilt). Because Anderson\\n\\ncannot show he suffered prejudice from this testimony, his claim of\\n\\nineffectiveness on this ground fails.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

SAUDER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        WARREN, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Frederick Sauder was convicted of malice murder\\n\\nand other crimes in connection with the armed robbery of Wayne\\n\\nAlexander on August 4, 2016, and his shooting death several days\\n\\nlater, on August 9 or 10.1 In this appeal, Sauder contends that the\\n\\n\\n        1 In December 2017, a White County grand jury indicted Sauder for the\\n\\nfollowing counts related to the August 4 crimes: armed robbery, aggravated\\nassault, burglary, two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission\\nof a felony (based on aggravated assault and burglary), and possession of a\\nfirearm by a convicted felon. Sauder was also indicted for the following crimes\\nrelated to the shooting on August 9 or 10: malice murder, two counts of felony\\nmurder (based on aggravated assault and burglary), aggravated assault,\\nburglary, three counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\nfelony (based on malice murder, aggravated assault, and burglary), and\\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts of possession of a\\nfirearm by a convicted felon were bifurcated. The remaining counts were tried\\nbefore a jury from February 11 to 19, 2019, and the jury found Sauder guilty\\nof those counts. The bifurcated counts were then nolle prossed. The trial court\\nsentenced Sauder to serve life in prison for malice murder, 20 consecutive years\\nfor armed robbery, 20 concurrent years for burglary, and 5 consecutive years\\neach for four of the counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of\\n evidence presented at his trial was legally insufficient to support\\n\\nseveral of his convictions. He also claims that the trial court abused\\n\\nits discretion by admitting into evidence an excerpt of a phone call\\n\\nhe made while in jail awaiting trial, that the court committed\\n\\nseveral instructional errors, that the State failed to disclose evidence\\n\\nthat two witnesses had “deals” in exchange for their testimony at\\n\\ntrial, and that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective\\n\\nassistance in several respects.           Finally, he contends that the\\n\\ncumulative effect of these alleged errors and deficiencies entitles\\n\\nhim to a new trial.        As we explain below, we vacate Sauder’s\\n\\nconviction for possession of a firearm during the commission of\\n\\naggravated assault to correct a merger error, but we affirm his other\\n\\nconvictions.\\n\\n\\n\\na felony (based on burglary on August 4 and malice murder, aggravated\\nassault, and burglary on August 9 or 10). The remaining counts were vacated\\nor merged. See Dixon v. State, \\n302 Ga. 691\\n, 698 (\\n808 SE2d 696\\n) (2017). Sauder\\nfiled a timely motion for new trial, which he later amended four times through\\nnew counsel. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion\\nin June 2023. Sauder filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court\\nalso denied. He then filed a timely notice of appeal, and the case was docketed\\nto the term of this Court beginning in December 2023 and orally argued on\\nJanuary 10, 2024.\\n                                      2\\n      1.   The evidence presented at Sauder’s trial showed the\\n\\nfollowing. In 2016, 66-year-old Alexander, who was in poor health\\n\\nand had dementia, lived alone in a mobile home on his property in\\n\\nCleveland, Georgia. Joshua Cunningham lived on a farm adjacent\\n\\nto Alexander’s property with several members of his family and his\\n\\ngirlfriend, Heather Holland. Cunningham and Holland often hung\\n\\nout and smoked methamphetamine with Sauder, Luke McClure,\\n\\nand McClure’s wife—all of whom also stayed on the farm.\\n\\n     On August 4, 2016, Cunningham, Holland, Sauder, and his\\n\\nfriend Justin Davis were at the farm when one of them “pointed out”\\n\\nAlexander’s mobile home and mentioned that it was “abandoned.”\\n\\nThey walked to the home, peered in the windows, and eventually\\n\\nwalked back to the farm.     According to Davis, he and Sauder\\n\\ndiscussed going to the mobile home again later. That night, they\\n\\nreturned to Alexander’s property, carrying Sauder’s shotgun and\\n\\ntools “in case [they] needed to break in.”          They smoked\\n\\nmethamphetamine in Alexander’s yard and then checked the doors\\n\\nto the mobile home, which were locked. They attempted to pry open\\n\\n                                3\\n a door, and Sauder kicked a sliding door several times before\\n\\nAlexander opened the door. They walked past Alexander, who said\\n\\nnothing. 2 Sauder, who was holding his shotgun, told Alexander to\\n\\nsit down.\\n\\n       Sauder took Alexander’s wallet, while Davis searched the home\\n\\nand gathered eight to 10 guns, which he found in Alexander’s closets,\\n\\nand a lockbox, which he found under Alexander’s bed. Davis then\\n\\ntook a power saw and some climbing gear from Alexander’s outdoor\\n\\nshed; he loaded those items, the guns, and the lockbox into Sauder’s\\n\\ncar.    At some point, Davis noticed that Alexander’s arm was\\n\\nbleeding; he asked Sauder what happened, and Sauder said that\\n\\nAlexander “came at him.”           As Sauder and Davis tried to leave,\\n\\nSauder’s car got stuck in Alexander’s muddy driveway. Sauder\\n\\ncalled Cunningham, and he and Holland soon arrived and towed\\n\\nSauder’s car out of the driveway. Sauder then dropped off Davis at\\n\\n\\n       2 Davis also testified that Alexander “didn’t even really care” that Sauder\\n\\nand Davis came into the home; Alexander did not “try to resist or do anything”\\nwhen they came in; and Davis “figured he was probably on painkillers or\\nsomething. Just out of his mind . . . .”\\n\\n                                        4\\n his house. Davis kept two guns, the saw, and the climbing gear, and\\n\\nSauder kept the remaining items. The next day, Sauder asked Davis\\n\\nif he wanted to return to Alexander’s home, but Davis said, “No.”\\n\\nSauder told Davis that “he wanted to homestead the place,” which\\n\\nDavis understood to mean that Sauder wanted to claim Alexander’s\\n\\nproperty for himself. Sauder said that he knew some people who\\n\\ncould “get rid of” Alexander.3\\n\\n      According to Cunningham, a few days later, on August 8,\\n\\nSauder, who was a convicted felon and thus unable to purchase a\\n\\ngun, asked Cunningham to accompany him to a pawn shop to trade\\n\\nfour guns that Sauder had for a new firearm. Cunningham agreed,\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 Davis testified that he was charged with armed robbery, aggravated\\n\\nassault, burglary, two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission\\nof a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in connection with\\nthe August 4 crimes; pursuant to an agreement that he would testify at\\nSauder’s trial, he pled guilty to armed robbery but had not yet been sentenced;\\nthe remaining charges, which could have added another 55 years in prison to\\nhis sentence, were dismissed; the maximum sentence for armed robbery was\\nlife in prison, but his plea agreement stated that his sentence would not exceed\\n20 years in prison; there was no agreement that the State would recommend\\nless than 20 years; his sentencing would be “up to the judge at the sentencing\\nhearing”; and he did not have any agreement with the State when he initially\\nspoke to law enforcement officials on August 18, 2016, and gave a statement\\nthat was similar to his testimony at trial.\\n\\n                                       5\\n and later that day, he and Sauder went to the pawn shop, and\\n\\nCunningham traded four guns, three of which Alexander’s wife\\n\\nMelita Alexander (“Melita”) identified at trial as belonging to\\n\\nAlexander, for a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle.4 Sauder carried the\\n\\nrifle out of the pawn shop, and he, Cunningham, and McClure later\\n\\nshot it on the farm for “target practice[ ].”5\\n\\n     The next day, August 9, Melita, who was separated from\\n\\nAlexander but still called him daily and kept many items at his\\n\\nhome, spoke to Alexander on the phone around 3:30 p.m. She called\\n\\nhim again around 9:30 p.m. When he did not answer, she called\\n\\nseveral more times throughout the night but received no response.\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 The owner of the pawn shop testified that he did not remember whether\\n\\nSauder was with Cunningham during the transaction. However, a GBI agent\\nwho interviewed the owner on August 11, 2016, testified that the owner said\\nthat a man who matched Sauder’s description was with Cunningham and that,\\nwhen shown a photo of Sauder, the owner identified him as the man with\\nCunningham.\\n\\n     5 Cunningham testified that he pled guilty to making a false statement,\\n\\ntheft by receiving stolen property, and theft by deception in connection with\\nthe pawn shop transaction; the maximum sentence he could have received was\\n25 years in prison; in exchange for his testimony, he was sentenced as a first\\noffender to five years’ probation and a $1,500 fine; and when an investigator\\ninitially interviewed him before he was charged, he recounted a story similar\\nto his testimony at trial.\\n                                      6\\n Around 6:00 p.m. the next day, August 10, Melita and her boyfriend\\n\\nwent to Alexander’s home to check on him. They saw tire tracks in\\n\\nthe driveway, and they noticed that the door to Alexander’s shed,\\n\\nwhich was normally locked, was ajar. When Melita went inside the\\n\\nmobile home, she saw near the door several of her musical\\n\\ninstruments, which she typically kept in a closet. The home was\\n\\n“ransacked.” Melita noticed jewelry boxes and several empty mason\\n\\njars, in which Alexander typically kept coins, on the floor in the\\n\\nbedroom, and several drawers were open. Alexander, who was dead\\n\\nand “stiff,” was slumped over on the couch with a jacket covering his\\n\\nhead. Investigators who responded to Melita’s 911 call found “pry\\n\\nmarks” on one of the doors to the mobile home and a lock that had\\n\\nbeen cut off the outdoor shed. They collected four .22-caliber shell\\n\\ncasings and two .22-caliber bullets from the scene.\\n\\n     According to Cunningham, Holland, and McClure, on August\\n\\n10 (the day Alexander’s body was found), Sauder was carrying\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 7\\n around a large number of coins.6 Holland and McClure’s wife took\\n\\nthe coins to a bank and converted them to $125 in cash, and\\n\\nMcClure’s wife used the money to rent a motel room.\\n\\n     In addition, Davis testified that at some point, Sauder told him\\n\\nthat he “watched” Alexander’s “ex-wife shoot him”; Cunningham\\n\\ntestified that Sauder told him at some point that he went inside\\n\\nAlexander’s home and Alexander “was already dead”; and McClure\\n\\ntestified that Sauder stated at various times that he went into\\n\\nAlexander’s home, Alexander was “sick and wasn’t doing too good,”\\n\\nAlexander “passed away,” and Sauder covered him with a blanket.\\n\\nMcClure also testified that at various points, Sauder asked McClure\\n\\nto accompany him to Alexander’s home (but McClure said “no”);\\n\\nSauder had a “metal box” with paperwork in it and the guns that\\n\\nMelita identified as belonging to Alexander; Sauder asked McClure\\n\\nand other people who were hanging out with him if they had heard\\n\\ngunshots and said that he had just shot a bear; and Sauder asked\\n\\n\\n\\n     6 Davis testified that neither he nor Sauder took a significant amount of\\n\\ncoins from Alexander on August 4.\\n                                     8\\n McClure to cut his hair shortly after the murder. 7\\n\\n      On August 11, the day after Alexander’s body was found, an\\n\\ninvestigator interviewed Cunningham, who told him about trading\\n\\nthe guns for the rifle at the pawn shop on Sauder’s behalf and about\\n\\nlater shooting the rifle at the farm. With Cunningham’s permission,\\n\\nthe investigator searched an area of the farm where Sauder often\\n\\nstayed and found 16 .22-caliber shell casings on the ground and\\n\\nnumerous partially burned documents that had Alexander’s name\\n\\non them in a burn barrel.\\n\\n      The next day, the investigator obtained a warrant for Sauder’s\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 Cunningham and Cunningham’s mother similarly testified that Sauder\\n\\nmentioned that he shot a bear around the time of the murder and that his\\nstatement did not strike them as unusual because sometimes there were bears\\non their property. Cunningham also testified that Sauder got a haircut around\\nthe time of the murder; McClure added that Sauder asked for a haircut because\\nhis hair was long, and McClure had been “giving him a hard time about how\\nhis hair looked.” The prosecutor asked Melita, her boyfriend, Davis,\\nCunningham, and McClure whether they were involved in the shooting, and\\nthey each denied it.\\n      In addition, McClure testified that he served six-and-a-half years in\\nprison for voluntary manslaughter in connection with an unrelated crime; he\\nwas released in June 2014 (about two years before the shooting) and was on\\nprobation; he was not charged with any crimes related to Alexander’s robbery\\nand shooting; but as a result of his “involvement in this case” and “receipt of\\nstolen property,” his probation was revoked and he was sentenced to a nine-\\nmonth-long, in-custody, substance abuse rehabilitation program.\\n                                      9\\n arrest. On August 16, police officers located Sauder at a motel in\\n\\nAthens. After attempting to communicate with him for about four\\n\\nhours outside his motel room, officers deployed chemical munitions;\\n\\nSauder finally left the room, and he was arrested. Investigators\\n\\nthen searched the motel room and Sauder’s car pursuant to a\\n\\nwarrant and found several cards and documents that had\\n\\nAlexander’s name on them and numerous items that Melita\\n\\nidentified at trial as belonging to her or to Alexander. Under a\\n\\nmattress in the motel room, investigators found the .22-caliber\\n\\nsemiautomatic rifle.\\n\\n     Investigators later searched a house in which Sauder rented a\\n\\nroom around the time of the shooting. Behind the house, they found\\n\\na trash bag that contained a name tag displaying Sauder’s name and\\n\\ndocuments with Alexander’s name on them.        They found more\\n\\ndocuments showing Alexander’s name in a burn barrel on the\\n\\nproperty. In addition, the owner of the property testified that he\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                10\\n saw Sauder carrying the .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle.8\\n\\n       The medical examiner who performed Alexander’s autopsy\\n\\nrecovered three .22-caliber bullets from his body and concluded that\\n\\nhe had been shot several times from an indeterminate range, which\\n\\ncaused his death, likely on August 9 or 10. A firearms examiner\\n\\ndetermined that all of the shell casings that were collected from\\n\\nAlexander’s home and 15 of the 16 shell casings that were collected\\n\\nfrom    Cunningham’s       farm    were    fired   from    the   .22-caliber\\n\\nsemiautomatic rifle. 9\\n\\n       The State also presented a 40-second excerpt of a phone call\\n\\nSauder made to his mother in August 2017, while he was in jail\\n\\nawaiting trial. During the call, Sauder said that “the other guy” was\\n\\nin jail. When his mother asked whether the “other guy” was “ready\\n\\nto point out” the person who shot Alexander, Sauder responded,\\n\\n“What do you mean? He wasn’t there.” He then said that it was\\n\\n\\n       8 Cunningham’s mother also testified that she saw Sauder carrying the\\n\\n.22-caliber rifle in the days surrounding the shooting.\\n       9 However, the examiner could not conclude whether the bullets found at\\n\\nAlexander’s home, the bullets recovered from Alexander’s body, or one of the\\nshell casings found at the farm were fired from the rifle.\\n                                     11\\n “hard to explain,” and he would “not do it over the phone.” An\\n\\ninvestigator testified that Davis was in jail at the time of the call\\n\\nand that the investigator did not know whether McClure was in jail\\n\\nat that time.\\n\\n     Sauder did not testify at trial. His primary defense was that\\n\\nthe State did not meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt that he killed Alexander.\\n\\n     2. (a) Sauder contends that the evidence presented at his trial\\n\\nwas insufficient as a matter of constitutional due process to support\\n\\nhis convictions for armed robbery on August 4, 2016, and malice\\n\\nmurder and three counts of possession of a firearm during the\\n\\ncommission of a felony on August 9 or 10, 2016. 10 This claim fails.\\n\\n     In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process, we view all of the evidence presented at\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     10 Sauder also contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the\\n\\ncounts of aggravated assault on August 4, possession of a firearm during the\\ncommission of that crime, and felony murder, aggravated assault, and burglary\\non August 9 or 10. But he was not sentenced for those crimes, so his claim\\nregarding them is moot. See, e.g., Felts v. State, \\n311 Ga. 547\\n, 551 n.7 (\\n858\\nSE2d 708\\n) (2021).\\n                                     12\\n trial in the light most favorable to the verdicts and consider whether\\n\\nany rational juror could have found the defendant guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt of the crimes of which he was convicted. See\\n\\nJackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n, 319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560)\\n\\n(1979).   “‘We leave to the jury the resolution of conflicts or\\n\\ninconsistencies in the evidence, credibility of witnesses, and\\n\\nreasonable inferences to be derived from the facts.’” Henderson v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 66\\n, 72 (\\n891 SE2d 884\\n) (2023) (citation omitted). A\\n\\njury is authorized to find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt if the evidence shows either that he “[d]irectly commit[ted] the\\n\\ncrime” or that he was a “party thereto.”          OCGA § 16-2-20.\\n\\n“Conviction as a party to a crime requires proof of a common\\n\\ncriminal intent, which the jury may infer from the defendant’s\\n\\npresence, companionship, and conduct with another perpetrator\\n\\nbefore, during, and after the crimes.” Rooks v. State, \\n317 Ga. 743\\n,\\n\\n751 (\\n893 SE2d 899\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). See\\n\\nalso, e.g., Howard v. State, Case No. S24A0105, \\n2024 WL 1160574\\n,\\n\\nat *3 (decided Mar. 19, 2024). “Mere presence at the crime scene,\\n\\n                                 13\\n however, is insufficient to make someone a party to a crime.” Rooks,\\n\\n317 Ga. at 751 (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Turning first to Sauder’s claim about the August 4 armed\\n\\nrobbery, the indictment charged him with armed robbery by using a\\n\\nfirearm to take Alexander’s guns. See OCGA § 16-8-41 (a) (“A person\\n\\ncommits the offense of armed robbery when, with intent to commit\\n\\ntheft, he or she takes property of another from the person or the\\n\\nimmediate presence of another by use of an offensive weapon . . . .”).\\n\\nSauder argues that the State failed to prove that he “use[d]” a\\n\\nfirearm to accomplish the theft because the evidence presented at\\n\\ntrial showed that Alexander opened the door and sat quietly while\\n\\nSauder and Davis stole his guns. But the element of “use of an\\n\\noffensive weapon” in OCGA § 16-8-41 (a) is satisfied by proof that\\n\\nthe weapon was “used as an instrument of actual or constructive\\n\\nforce—that is, actual violence exerted on the victim or force exerted\\n\\nupon the victim by operating on the victim’s fears of injury to the\\n\\nperson, property, or character of the victim such that the defendant’s\\n\\nacts created a reasonable apprehension on the part of the victim that\\n\\n                                 14\\n an offensive weapon is being used.” Green v. State, \\n304 Ga. 385\\n, 389\\n\\n(\\n818 SE2d 535\\n) (2018) (citation and punctuation omitted).         The\\n\\nevidence showing that Sauder held a shotgun and ordered\\n\\nAlexander to sit down while Davis collected Alexander’s guns\\n\\nauthorized the jury to conclude that Sauder used a firearm to\\n\\naccomplish the theft of the guns.         Thus, the evidence was\\n\\nconstitutionally sufficient to support Sauder’s conviction as a party\\n\\nto the crime of armed robbery. See Jackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n; OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-2-20 (defining parties to a crime). See also Green, \\n304 Ga. at\\n\\n389\\n (holding that evidence that the appellant “pulled out a gun and\\n\\nasked [the victim] what he had in his pockets” was sufficient to prove\\n\\nthat the appellant used an offensive weapon within the meaning of\\n\\nOCGA § 16-8-41 (a)); Bass v. State, \\n356 Ga. App. 862\\n, 867 (\\n849 SE2d\\n\\n718\\n) (2020) (holding that evidence that the appellant “held [a] gun\\n\\nin his hand” while he took items from the victim was sufficient to\\n\\nsupport his armed robbery conviction).\\n\\n     As to the crimes on August 9 or 10, the evidence indicated that\\n\\nafter Sauder and Davis stole guns from Alexander, Sauder\\n\\n                                 15\\n mentioned    “get[ting]     rid     of”    Alexander;    Sauder     enlisted\\n\\nCunningham     to   trade     the     stolen   guns     for   a   .22-caliber\\n\\nsemiautomatic rifle—the gun used to shoot and kill Alexander days\\n\\nlater; Sauder admitted that he returned to Alexander’s home and\\n\\nwas there at the time of the shooting; after the murder, Sauder was\\n\\ncarrying coins and many other items that belonged to Alexander and\\n\\nMelita; and Sauder hid the rifle used in the shooting under a\\n\\nmattress in his motel room. This evidence authorized the jury to\\n\\nfind Sauder guilty at least as a party to the crimes of malice murder\\n\\nand possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. See\\n\\nJackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n; OCGA § 16-2-20. See also Henderson, 317\\n\\nGa. at 72 (holding that evidence that connected the appellant to the\\n\\nmurder weapon and that he admitted he was at the scene of the\\n\\nshootings was constitutionally sufficient to support his malice\\n\\nmurder convictions); Blevins v. State, \\n291 Ga. 814\\n, 815-817 (\\n733\\n\\nSE2d 744\\n) (2012) (concluding that evidence that the appellant was\\n\\nnear the crime scene at the time of the murder and shortly\\n\\nthereafter tried to pawn items that belonged to the victim was\\n\\n                                      16\\n constitutionally sufficient to support his conviction for malice\\n\\nmurder).\\n\\n     (b) Sauder also claims that the evidence was insufficient as a\\n\\nmatter of Georgia statutory law to support his convictions for the\\n\\nAugust 9 or 10 crimes discussed above—malice murder and three\\n\\ncounts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony—\\n\\nbecause the circumstantial evidence failed to exclude the hypothesis\\n\\nthat Cunningham, McClure, or another one of Sauder’s friends\\n\\nkilled Alexander and that Sauder did not participate in the crimes.\\n\\nUnder OCGA § 24-14-6, “[t]o warrant a conviction on circumstantial\\n\\nevidence, the proved facts shall not only be consistent with the\\n\\nhypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude every other reasonable\\n\\nhypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.” Whether an\\n\\nalternative hypothesis is reasonable “is usually a question for the\\n\\njury, as this Court will not disturb the jury’s finding unless it is\\n\\ninsufficient as a matter of law.” Reyes v. State, \\n309 Ga. 660\\n, 664 (\\n847\\n\\nSE2d 194\\n) (2020).\\n\\n     Assuming without deciding that the evidence related to the\\n\\n                                  17\\n August 9 or 10 crimes was entirely circumstantial, the evidence\\n\\nrecounted above was sufficient to authorize the jury to reject as\\n\\nunreasonable Sauder’s alternative hypothesis. As discussed above,\\n\\nthe State presented substantial evidence showing that Sauder\\n\\nparticipated in the shooting, including evidence that he said he\\n\\nwanted to “get rid” of Alexander, he stole numerous items from\\n\\nAlexander’s home after the initial robbery with Davis, he was\\n\\npresent at the time of the shooting, and he possessed the murder\\n\\nweapon. Moreover, when the prosecutor asked Cunningham and\\n\\nMcClure if they were involved in the shooting, they squarely denied\\n\\nit. But even if the jury believed that Cunningham, McClure, or\\n\\nanother one of Sauder’s friends shot Alexander, the jury could have\\n\\nreasonably concluded that Sauder shared with the shooter a\\n\\ncommon criminal intent to kill Alexander.      Thus, the jury was\\n\\nauthorized to reject the hypothesis that Sauder did not participate\\n\\nin the shooting and to instead find that he was guilty at least as a\\n\\nparty to the crimes of malice murder and possession of a firearm\\n\\nduring the commission of a felony.     See, e.g., OCGA § 16-2-20;\\n\\n                                18\\nHoward, 2024\\n WL 1160574, at *3 (explaining that “a jury may infer\\n\\na defendant’s criminal intent, and thereby find him guilty as a party\\n\\nto a crime, ‘from his presence, companionship, and conduct before,\\n\\nduring, and after the offense’”) (citation omitted). See also Reyes,\\n\\n309 Ga. at 664-665 (concluding that evidence that the appellant had\\n\\nthreatened to kill the victim and evidence connecting him to the\\n\\nmurder weapon was sufficient under OCGA § 24-14-6 to support his\\n\\nconviction for malice murder); Blevins, \\n291 Ga. at 815-817\\n (holding\\n\\nthat evidence that the appellant was near the crime scene at the\\n\\ntime of the murder and shortly thereafter tried to pawn items that\\n\\nbelonged to the victim was sufficient under former OCGA § 24-4-6).11\\n\\n      3. Sauder claims next that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nby admitting into evidence the 40-second audio-recorded excerpt of\\n\\nthe jail phone call—in which Sauder’s mother asked if the “other\\n\\nguy” was ready to point out who shot Alexander and Sauder\\n\\n\\n      11 OCGA § 24-4-6, which was part of the old Evidence Code, was carried\\n\\ninto the current Evidence Code in identical form in OCGA § 24-14-6, and there\\nis no materially identical federal rule of evidence, so our case law interpreting\\nthe former provision is still applicable. See Kimbro v. State, \\n317 Ga. 442\\n, 446\\nn.6 (\\n893 SE2d 678\\n) (2023).\\n                                       19\\n responded, “What do you mean? He wasn’t there”—over his objection\\n\\nthat the excerpt was not admissible under subsection (a) of OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-4-408 (“Rule 408”).        For the reasons explained below, we\\n\\ndisagree.\\n\\n     Rule 408 (a) says:\\n\\n     Except as provided in Code Section 9-11-68 [which relates\\n     to liability for attorney fees and litigation expenses when\\n     a party rejects a settlement offer in a tort case], evidence\\n     of:\\n\\n            (1) Furnishing, offering, or promising to furnish; or\\n            (2) Accepting, offering, or promising to accept\\n\\n     a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting\\n     to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either\\n     validity or amount shall not be admissible to prove\\n     liability for or invalidity of any claim or its amount.[12]\\n\\n     12 The remaining subsections of Rule 408 provide:\\n\\n\\n\\n     (b)   Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise\\n     negotiations or mediation shall not be admissible.\\n\\n     (c)   This Code section shall not require the exclusion of any\\n     evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in\\n     the course of compromise negotiations or mediation. This Code\\n     section shall not require exclusion of evidence offered for another\\n     purpose, including, but not limited to, proving bias or prejudice of\\n     a witness, negating a contention of undue delay or abuse of\\n     process, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or\\n     prosecution.\\n\\n                                      20\\n Sauder argues that the excerpt of the phone call should have been\\n\\nexcluded under Rule 408 (a) because during other parts of the call\\n\\n(which were not admitted into evidence), Sauder made statements\\n\\nthat he claims constituted evidence of “an offer to compromise a\\n\\ndisputed claim.” Specifically, Sauder repeatedly asked his mother\\n\\nto call his lawyer and to reach out to the District Attorney to inform\\n\\nthe lawyer and the District Attorney that Sauder was “willing to\\n\\ndeal”; he was “ready to . . . tell [them] all that really happened”; and\\n\\nhe would “pick the person that did it out of a lineup” based on “what\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe note that Rule 408 (a) is materially identical to Federal Rule of Evidence\\n408 (a) (1), which says:\\n\\n     (a) Prohibited Uses.

See State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 556 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018). See also\\nRonald L. Carlson & Michael Scott Carlson, Carlson on Evidence 182 (8th ed.\\n2023) (explaining that Georgia Rule 408 follows the federal rule).\\n                                     21\\n [Sauder] saw.” Asserting that these entreaties to his mother were\\n\\nan “offer to compromise” with the State, Sauder claims that the trial\\n\\ncourt abused its discretion by admitting his statement implying that\\n\\nhe was present (and the “other guy” was not) when Alexander was\\n\\nshot, because that statement was part and parcel of such an offer.\\n\\n      Even assuming (without deciding) that Rule 408 (a) could\\n\\napply to exclude a defendant’s attempts “to compromise” with the\\n\\nState by negotiating a plea deal regarding charges in a criminal\\n\\ncase, Sauder has not shown that the statements he made to his\\n\\nmother fell within the ambit of the rule.13 In particular, Sauder cites\\n\\n\\n      13 The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has held\\n\\nthat Federal Rule of Evidence 408 applies in both criminal and civil cases. See,\\ne.g., United States v. Arias, 431 F3d 1327, 1336-1338 (11th Cir. 2005). See also\\nState v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 559 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018) (explaining that when\\na rule in our current Evidence Code is materially identical to a Federal Rule of\\nEvidence and there are conflicts ‘among the decisions of the various circuit\\ncourts of appeal[s] in interpreting the federal rules of evidence,’ the precedent\\nof the Eleventh Circuit prevails”) (quoting Ga. L. 2011, pp. 99, 100 § 1). But it\\nappears that the Eleventh Circuit has not addressed whether Federal Rule of\\nEvidence 408 could apply to exclude evidence of plea negotiations. See United\\nStates v. King, \\n623 Fed. Appx. 962\\n, 965-966 (11th Cir. 2015) (addressing the\\nadmissibility of a USPS administrative complaint and cease and desist order\\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 408 in a criminal case); Arias, 431 F3d at 1336-\\n1338 (holding that a state administrative complaint was not admissible under\\nFederal Rule of Evidence 408 in the appellant’s criminal proceeding); United\\nStates v. Pendergraft, 297 F3d 1198, 1211 n.8 (11th Cir. 2002) (noting that a\\n\\n                                       22\\n no pertinent legal authority, and we have found none, to support his\\n\\nassertion that any of the statements at issue here constituted an\\n\\n“offer” within the meaning of Rule 408 (a).14 None of the statements\\n\\nin the excerpt of the recording that was played for the jury\\n\\nmentioned, or even implied, that Sauder wanted to negotiate a plea\\n\\ndeal with the State. And even if we were to assume that these\\n\\nstatements were made in connection with Sauder’s asking his\\n\\nmother to contact his lawyer and the District Attorney to indicate\\n\\n\\n\\nvideo of a civil settlement negotiation in which the appellants participated was\\nadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 408 in the appellants’ criminal\\ncases). See also Federal Practice and Procedure (Wright & Miller) § 5303 (2d\\ned. Feb. 2024 Update) (explaining that several federal circuit courts have held\\nthat Federal Rule of Evidence 408 bars “the use of evidence of civil compromise\\nnegotiations in a criminal prosecution,” but whether the rule applies “to plea\\nbargaining in a criminal case when the evidence of such plea bargaining is\\noffered in a civil or a criminal case” is “more debatable”).\\n      We also note that OCGA § 24-4-410 (4) generally prohibits the State from\\nintroducing against a criminal defendant evidence of “[a]ny statement made in\\nthe course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority\\nwhich does not result in a plea of guilty.” Sauder does not claim that his\\nstatements to his mother should be excluded under that rule.\\n\\n      14 Sauder relies primarily on Nevitt v. CMD Realty Investment Fund IV,\\n\\nL.P., \\n282 Ga. App. 533\\n, 535-538 (\\n639 SE2d 336\\n) (2006). But that case\\ninterpreted former OCGA § 24-3-37, which was part of our old Evidence Code\\nand said, in pertinent part, “admissions or propositions made with a view to a\\ncompromise are not proper evidence.” Because that provision is not part of our\\ncurrent Evidence Code, Nevitt is not applicable. See State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga.\\n553\\n, 556 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018).\\n                                      23\\n that he was “willing” and “ready” to make a deal, that request was\\n\\nnot an “offer” under Rule 408 (a) either; at best, Sauder’s request\\n\\nimplored his mother (who had no authority to negotiate a plea deal\\n\\non his behalf) to initiate contact with the lawyers involved in his\\n\\ncase to ask them to begin discussions that he hoped might lead to\\n\\nhis receiving an offer from the State for a negotiated plea. Simply\\n\\nput, Sauder’s asking his mother to ask the State to provide a plea\\n\\ndeal did not constitute an offer to compromise within the meaning\\n\\nof Rule 408 (a).\\n\\n     Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion by concluding that the statements at issue did\\n\\nnot need to be excluded under that rule.      See United States v.\\n\\nCastillo, 615 F2d 878, 885 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that an\\n\\nappellant’s statement to a prison counselor “that he would probably\\n\\n‘cop’ to a charge of manslaughter” was not excludable under Federal\\n\\nRule of Evidence 408 because the appellant could not have\\n\\nnegotiated a plea deal with the counselor, who had no such\\n\\nauthority). See also United States v. Fernandez, 559 F3d 303, 318\\n\\n                                24\\n (5th Cir. 2009) (noting that Federal Rule of Evidence 408 “would\\n\\nappear to bar” evidence of a proffer letter for the appellant’s\\n\\nimmunity from prosecution but that his “preceding conversation”\\n\\nwith law enforcement agents and “perhaps even his offer to ‘help\\n\\nout”” by providing the agents more information “would remain\\n\\nadmissible”). 15\\n\\n      4. Sauder contends that the trial court erred when, while\\n\\ninstructing the jury about the State’s burden of proof, the court\\n\\ndeclined to give the pattern jury instruction on “grave suspicion,”\\n\\nwhich says, “Facts and circumstances that merely place upon the\\n\\ndefendant a grave suspicion of the crime charged or that merely\\n\\nraise a speculation or conjecture of the defendant’s guilt are not\\n\\n\\n\\n      15  As mentioned above, although Rule 408 (a) excludes evidence of\\ncertain offers and acceptances, Rule 408 (b) more broadly mandates the\\nexclusion of “[e]vidence of . . . statements made in compromise negotiations.”\\n(Emphasis added). See E.E.O.C. v. UMB Bank Financial Corp., 558 F3d 784,\\n791 (8th Cir. 2009) (noting that several federal courts of appeal have held that\\nFederal Rule of Evidence 408 (a) (2), which excludes “conduct or a statement\\nmade during compromise negotiations about the claim,” may apply to “certain\\nwork product, internal memos, and other material created specifically for the\\npurpose of conciliation, even if not communicated to the other party” and\\ncollecting cases). But Sauder does not argue that Rule 408 (b) applies here, so\\nwe do not address it.\\n                                      25\\n sufficient to authorize a conviction of the defendant.”       Georgia\\n\\nSuggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases\\n\\n§ 1.20.20. This claim fails.\\n\\n     “In evaluating a claim that the trial court was required to give\\n\\ncertain jury instructions, we view the charge as a whole to determine\\n\\nwhether the jury was fully and fairly instructed.” Clark v. State, \\n315\\n\\nGa. 423\\n, 440 (\\n883 SE2d 317\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). Here, the trial court thoroughly instructed the jury on the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, the State’s burden to prove beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt each essential element of the charged crimes,\\n\\ncriminal intent, and parties to a crime. Those instructions fully\\n\\ninformed the jury that it was not authorized to find Sauder guilty as\\n\\na party to the crimes if the evidence presented at trial merely raised\\n\\n“a grave suspicion” or “a speculation or conjecture” of his guilt.\\n\\nGeorgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal\\n\\nCases § 1.20.20. And in any event, given the evidence presented at\\n\\ntrial and detailed above, the substantial evidence against Sauder\\n\\nraised more than a grave suspicion of his guilt, at least as a party to\\n\\n                                  26\\n the crimes. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by refusing to\\n\\ninstruct the jury on grave suspicion. See Welch v. State, \\n309 Ga.\\n\\n875\\n, 879 (\\n848 SE2d 846\\n) (2020) (holding that the trial court did not\\n\\nerr by failing to instruct the jury on grave suspicion, because the\\n\\ncourt “‘gave complete instructions on reasonable doubt and\\n\\npresumption of innocence’” and “‘[t]he trial evidence raised more\\n\\nthan a bare suspicion of [the appellant’s] guilt’”) (citations omitted);\\n\\nJenkins v. State, \\n281 Ga. 24\\n, 25 (\\n635 SE2d 714\\n) (2006) (same). See\\n\\nalso Clark, 315 Ga. at 440-441 (concluding that the trial court’s\\n\\nomission of an instruction on grave suspicion was not a clear and\\n\\nobvious error under plain-error review, because the court instructed\\n\\non the presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt, criminal intent,\\n\\nand parties to a crime, which fully informed the jury that it was not\\n\\nauthorized to find the appellant guilty as a party to the crimes\\n\\nunless he shared his co-defendant’s criminal intent to shoot the\\n\\nvictim).\\n\\n     5. Sauder argues that the trial court committed plain error by\\n\\nfailing to provide jury instructions on circumstantial evidence, mere\\n\\n                                  27\\n presence and knowledge, and the law requiring corroboration of an\\n\\naccomplice’s testimony. As Sauder acknowledges, his trial counsel\\n\\ndid not object to the alleged omission of these instructions, so we\\n\\nreview these claims for plain error only. See OCGA § 17-8-58 (b);\\n\\nClark, 315 Ga. at 440. To establish plain error, Sauder must show\\n\\nthat the alleged instructional error “was not affirmatively waived;\\n\\nwas clear and obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute;\\n\\nlikely affected the outcome of the trial; and seriously affected the\\n\\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Id.\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). “An appellant must establish all\\n\\nfour elements of the test in order to demonstrate plain error, so\\n\\nsatisfying this test is difficult, as it should be.” Id. (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). We address each of Sauder’s claims in turn.\\n\\n     (a) With respect to circumstantial evidence, Sauder argues\\n\\nthat the trial court failed to instruct the jury on OCGA § 24-14-6,\\n\\nwhich as discussed above in relation to Sauder’s statutory\\n\\nsufficiency claim, says, “To warrant a conviction on circumstantial\\n\\nevidence, the proved facts shall not only be consistent with the\\n\\n                                  28\\n hypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude every other reasonable\\n\\nhypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.” But the trial court\\n\\ngave the pattern jury instruction on direct and circumstantial\\n\\nevidence, which says, among other things, that the jury “would be\\n\\nauthorized to convict only if the evidence, whether direct,\\n\\ncircumstantial, or both, excludes all reasonable theories of innocence\\n\\nand proves the guilt of the [defendant] beyond a reasonable doubt.”\\n\\nGeorgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal\\n\\nCases § 1.30.20 (brackets omitted). That instruction conveyed the\\n\\nsubstance of OCGA § 24-14-6. Thus, the trial court did not err, much\\n\\nless clearly and obviously so, in this respect. See Eubanks v. State,\\n\\n317 Ga. 563\\n, 580 (\\n894 SE2d 27\\n) (2023) (holding that the trial court\\n\\ndid not err by giving the pattern jury instruction on circumstantial\\n\\nevidence rather than instructing that the “State had to disprove any\\n\\ntheory of innocence supported by the evidence,” because the pattern\\n\\ninstruction “effectively conveyed” that point) (emphasis omitted).\\n\\nSee also Hassan v. State, Case No. S24A0026, \\n2024 WL 1160729\\n, at\\n\\n*5 (decided Mar. 19, 2024) (rejecting the appellant’s argument that\\n\\n                                 29\\n a jury instruction, which was similar to the one given in this case,\\n\\nfailed to advise the jury of OCGA § 24-14-6 and holding that the\\n\\ninstruction was not a clear and obvious error).16\\n\\n      (b) Sauder asserts that the trial court’s failure to instruct the\\n\\njury on mere presence and knowledge was plain error. However, as\\n\\ndiscussed above in relation to Sauder’s claim that the court erred by\\n\\nfailing to instruct the jury on grave suspicion, the court thoroughly\\n\\ninstructed on the presumption of innocence, the State’s burden to\\n\\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element of the\\n\\ncharged crimes, criminal intent, and parties to a crime.                 These\\n\\ninstructions adequately informed the jury that it was not authorized\\n\\nto find Sauder guilty if he was merely present at the scene of the\\n\\n\\n      16 Sauder also argues that the trial court incorrectly instructed that the\\n\\njury “should not be concerned about whether the evidence is direct or\\ncircumstantial” and that “[t]here is no legal difference in the weight [the jury]\\nmay give to either direct or circumstantial evidence,” in accordance with the\\npattern jury instruction on direct and circumstantial evidence. See Georgia\\nSuggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases § 1.30.20. But\\nhe cites no authority to support that argument, so he has not carried his burden\\nof showing that the court clearly and obviously erred by giving those\\ninstructions. See Hassan, \\n2024 WL 1160729\\n, at *5 (rejecting the appellant’s\\nclaim that the trial court committed plain error by giving similar jury\\ninstructions, because he cited no controlling authority for the proposition that\\nthe instructions were erroneous).\\n                                       30\\n crime or if he did not knowingly and intentionally participate in the\\n\\ncrimes. Thus, when evaluated in the context of the jury charge as a\\n\\nwhole, the trial court’s failure to expressly instruct on mere presence\\n\\nand knowledge was not a clear and obvious error beyond reasonable\\n\\ndispute. See, e.g., Clark, 315 Ga. at 441 (holding that the trial court\\n\\ndid not clearly and obviously err by failing to instruct the jury on\\n\\nmere presence and knowledge, because the court instructed on the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, the State’s burden of proof, criminal\\n\\nintent, and parties to a crime).\\n\\n     (c) Asserting that Cunningham and McClure were accomplices\\n\\nto the August 9 or 10 crimes, Sauder contends that the trial court\\n\\ncommitted plain error by instructing the jury that the testimony of\\n\\na single witness, if believed, was sufficient to establish a fact without\\n\\nalso instructing that, with respect to those crimes, accomplice\\n\\ntestimony must be corroborated.17 See OCGA § 24-14-8; Doyle v.\\n\\nState, \\n307 Ga. 609\\n, 612-613 (\\n837 SE2d 833\\n) (2020) (explaining that\\n\\n\\n\\n     17  The trial court gave an accomplice-corroboration instruction with\\nrespect to the August 4 crimes.\\n                                   31\\n an accomplice-corroboration instruction is required when there is\\n\\nslight evidence supporting a finding that a witness was an\\n\\naccomplice and that a trial court’s failure to give such an instruction,\\n\\nwhile giving a single-witness instruction, in a case where the\\n\\ndefendant was directly linked to the crimes through an accomplice’s\\n\\ntestimony, generally constitutes a clear and obvious error under\\n\\nplain-error review). Assuming without deciding that Sauder did not\\n\\naffirmatively waive this argument and that there was slight\\n\\nevidence that Cunningham and McClure were accomplices such that\\n\\nthe failure to give an accomplice-corroboration instruction regarding\\n\\nthe August 9 or 10 crimes was a clear and obvious error, Sauder has\\n\\nnot established that any such error likely affected the jury’s guilty\\n\\nverdicts.\\n\\n     Even if an accomplice-corroboration instruction had been\\n\\ngiven, the jury likely would have concluded that Cunningham’s and\\n\\nMcClure’s testimony about the August 9 or 10 crimes was\\n\\nsufficiently corroborated, because the State presented a substantial\\n\\namount of corroborating evidence. In this respect, evidence that\\n\\n                                  32\\n corroborates an accomplice’s testimony\\n\\n     may be circumstantial and it may be slight, and it need\\n     not of itself be sufficient to warrant a conviction of the\\n     crime charged. It must, however, be independent of the\\n     accomplice’s testimony and either directly connect the\\n     defendant with the crime or justify an inference that he is\\n     guilty. In addition, the independent evidence must\\n     corroborate both the identity of the defendant and the fact\\n     of his participation in the crime. In other words,\\n     corroboration of only the chronology and details of the\\n     crimes is not sufficient, and there must be some\\n     independent evidence tending to show that the defendant\\n     himself was a participant in the crimes.\\n\\nCrawford v. State, \\n294 Ga. 898\\n, 900-901 (\\n757 SE2d 102\\n) (2014)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted). Moreover, “‘[i]t is well settled\\n\\nthat an accomplice’s testimony may be corroborated by the\\n\\ntestimony of another accomplice.’” Jackson v. State, \\n314 Ga. 751\\n,\\n\\n755 (\\n879 SE2d 410\\n) (2022) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, Cunningham’s testimony about obtaining the .22-caliber\\n\\nsemiautomatic rifle—the murder weapon—for Sauder at the pawn\\n\\nshop was corroborated by statements from other witnesses,\\n\\nincluding the pawn shop owner’s statement to the GBI agent that\\n\\nSauder was with Cunningham when Cunningham obtained the gun;\\n\\ntestimony from Cunningham’s mother and the owner of the property\\n                                 33\\n where Sauder rented a room that Sauder was carrying the rifle in\\n\\nthe days leading up to the murder; and evidence that investigators\\n\\nfound the rifle in Sauder’s motel room when he was arrested.\\n\\nMcClure’s testimony that, at some point, Sauder asked McClure to\\n\\naccompany him to Alexander’s home was corroborated by Davis’s\\n\\nsimilar testimony that Sauder “wanted to homestead the place” and\\n\\nhad asked Davis if he wanted to return to the home after the August\\n\\n4 robbery. Cunningham and McClure both testified that Sauder was\\n\\ncarrying a significant number of coins on the day Alexander’s body\\n\\nwas found, that Sauder indicated that he had gone inside\\n\\nAlexander’s home and had seen his dead body, and that he had\\n\\nmentioned that he shot a bear around the time of the murder—thus\\n\\ncorroborating each other’s accounts on those points.18 Moreover, the\\n\\n\\n\\n      18 We note that Cunningham and McClure also corroborated each other’s\\n\\ntestimony that Sauder got a haircut around the time of the murder. And in\\nany event, the evidence that Sauder got a haircut near the time of the murder\\nlikely had little impact on the jury’s guilty verdicts, given that McClure\\ntestified that Sauder needed a haircut and that the State presented other, more\\nprobative evidence to show that Sauder tried to evade law enforcement officials\\nafter the crimes, including evidence that Sauder fled to a motel in Athens\\nshortly after the murder and refused to leave when investigators attempted to\\narrest him.\\n                                      34\\n State introduced independent evidence corroborating Cunningham’s\\n\\nand McClure’s testimony.      Specifically, Holland testified about\\n\\nSauder’s carrying a large amount of coins; Davis testified that\\n\\nSauder said he “watched” Alexander’s “ex-wife shoot him,” implying\\n\\nthat Sauder was present at the time of the shooting (although he\\n\\ninexplicably pointed to Melita as the shooter), and Sauder indicated\\n\\nduring the jail phone call that he was present when Alexander was\\n\\nshot; and Cunningham’s mother testified about Sauder’s saying he\\n\\nshot a bear.\\n\\n     In sum, given the ample evidence corroborating Cunningham’s\\n\\nand McClure’s testimony about the August 9 or 10 crimes, Sauder\\n\\nhas not shown a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial\\n\\nwould have been different had the jury been instructed under OCGA\\n\\n24-14-8 that an accomplice’s testimony must be corroborated. He\\n\\nhas therefore failed to establish plain error. See, e.g., Jackson, 314\\n\\nGa. at 755-756 (holding that the appellant could not establish that\\n\\nthe trial court’s failure to give an accomplice-corroboration\\n\\ninstruction likely affected the outcome of his trial under the third\\n\\n                                 35\\n part of the plain-error test, because multiple witnesses corroborated\\n\\nthat the appellant participated in the crimes); Lewis v. State, \\n311\\n\\nGa. 650\\n, 665-666 (\\n859 SE2d 1\\n) (2021) (concluding that the trial\\n\\ncourt’s failure to given an accomplice-corroboration instruction with\\n\\nrespect to certain counts in the indictment likely did not affect the\\n\\noutcome of the appellant’s trial under plain-error review, because\\n\\n“the State introduced a substantial amount of evidence that\\n\\ncorroborated [the alleged accomplice’s] testimony as to those\\n\\ncounts”). Compare Doyle, 307 Ga. at 612-614 (holding that the trial\\n\\ncourt plainly erred by failing to instruct the jury on accomplice\\n\\ncorroboration where the accomplice’s testimony “was the bedrock on\\n\\nwhich [the appellant’s] convictions rest”).\\n\\n     6.   Sauder claims that the State violated his right to due\\n\\nprocess under Brady v. Maryland, \\n373 U.S. 83\\n (83 SCt 1194, 10\\n\\nLE2d 215) (1963), by failing fully to disclose that Davis and McClure\\n\\nhad “deals” in exchange for their testimony. Specifically, Sauder\\n\\nargues that although Davis testified at trial that his guilty plea\\n\\nagreement stated that in exchange for his testimony, the State\\n\\n                                  36\\n would recommend that his sentence for armed robbery would not\\n\\nexceed 20 years in prison and there was no agreement that the State\\n\\nwould recommend a sentence of less than 20 years, one of the\\n\\nprosecutors made a deal with Davis’s plea counsel agreeing to\\n\\nrecommend that Davis be sentenced to only 10 years in prison.\\n\\nSauder also asserts that the State made a deal with McClure that\\n\\nin exchange for his testimony, the State would not charge him for\\n\\ncrimes related to this case and would recommend lenient treatment\\n\\nin an unrelated probation- revocation matter. As explained below,\\n\\nwe conclude that the trial court did not err by denying Sauder’s\\n\\nmotion for new trial on this ground. See, e.g., Hood v. State, \\n311 Ga.\\n\\n855\\n, 863 (\\n860 SE2d 432\\n) (2021) (explaining that a trial court’s\\n\\nfactual findings regarding a Brady claim are reviewed under a\\n\\nclearly erroneous standard, while the court’s application of the law\\n\\nto the facts is reviewed de novo).\\n\\n     It is well established that:\\n\\n     “The suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable\\n     to an accused upon request violates due process where the\\n     evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\\n\\n                                     37\\n      irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\\n     prosecution.” Brady, \\n373 U. S. at 87\\n. This includes the\\n     suppression of impeachment evidence that may be used\\n     to challenge the credibility of a witness. See Giglio v.\\n     United States, \\n405 U. S. 150\\n, 154-155 (92 SCt 763, 31\\n     LE2d 104) (1972). Accordingly, the State is obligated to\\n     reveal any agreement, even an informal one, with a\\n     witness regarding criminal charges pending against the\\n     witness. To prevail on a Brady claim, a defendant must\\n     show that the State possessed evidence favorable to the\\n     defendant; the defendant did not possess the evidence nor\\n     could he obtain it himself with any reasonable diligence;\\n     the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and\\n     had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, a\\n     reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the\\n     proceeding would have been different.\\n\\nHood, 311 Ga. at 863 (cleaned up). A reasonable probability of a\\n\\ndifferent result, also known as the materiality requirement, is\\n\\nestablished when the State’s suppression of evidence “‘undermines\\n\\nconfidence in the outcome of the trial.’” Id. at 864 (citation omitted).\\n\\n“In this analysis, we review the record de novo and weigh the\\n\\nevidence as we would expect reasonable jurors to have done, rather\\n\\nthan viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the\\n\\nverdicts.” State v. Thomas, \\n311 Ga. 407\\n, 417 (\\n858 SE2d 52\\n) (2021).\\n\\nSo viewed, even assuming that Sauder could establish the first three\\n\\nelements of his Brady claim, he has not met the materiality\\n                                  38\\n requirement, because he has not shown a reasonable probability\\n\\nthat the outcome of his trial would have been different if the State\\n\\nhad disclosed information about Davis’s and McClure’s alleged\\n\\ndeals. See Kyles v. Whitley, \\n514 U.S. 419\\n, 436 (115 SCt 1555, 131\\n\\nLE2d 490) (1995) (explaining that Brady materiality is defined “in\\n\\nterms of suppressed evidence considered collectively, not item by\\n\\nitem”).\\n\\n     Turning first to Sauder’s assertion that the State failed to\\n\\ndisclose an alleged agreement with Davis for a recommendation of a\\n\\n10-year prison sentence, we note that Davis testified that pursuant\\n\\nto his deal with the State, he pled guilty to armed robbery—a crime\\n\\nfor which the maximum sentence is life in prison—with a sentence\\n\\nthat would not exceed 20 years; the State dismissed other charges\\n\\nthat could have added 55 years to his sentence; and the ultimate\\n\\nsentencing decision would be “up to the judge at the sentencing\\n\\nhearing.”   Thus, although the jury was not informed of Davis’s\\n\\nalleged deal for a 10-year sentence, it was nonetheless aware that\\n\\nhe had a significant incentive to cooperate with the State by\\n\\n                                39\\n testifying against Sauder. See Hood, 311 Ga. at 861-864 (holding\\n\\nthat the appellant failed to prove the materiality prong of the Brady\\n\\ntest and explaining that although the State allegedly failed to\\n\\ndisclose that a witness had a deal for a sentence of 25 months and\\n\\nthree years of supervised release as well as the dismissal of several\\n\\nfelony charges, the jury was informed that he faced a sentence of 85\\n\\nto 105 months and that his plea agreement said the State would\\n\\nconsider his cooperation in determining whether to recommend a\\n\\nreduced sentence, so the jury was “aware that there was reason to\\n\\nregard his testimony with skepticism”); Rhodes v. State, \\n299 Ga. 367\\n,\\n\\n369-370 (\\n788 SE2d 359\\n) (2016) (holding that there was no\\n\\nreasonable probability that the alleged failure to disclose the terms\\n\\nand extent of deals with two witnesses affected the outcome of the\\n\\nappellant’s trial, because the jury was aware of their motivations to\\n\\ntestify to gain favor with the State).\\n\\n     Moreover, Davis testified, and Sauder does not dispute, that he\\n\\nhad no agreement with the State whatsoever when he gave a\\n\\nstatement to law enforcement officials about a week after the\\n\\n                                  40\\n murder in August 2016—nearly two-and-a-half years before\\n\\nSauder’s trial and more than three years before the date of Davis’s\\n\\nsentencing in August 2019—that was consistent with his testimony\\n\\nat trial. See Harris v. State, \\n309 Ga. 599\\n, 606-607 (\\n847 SE2d 563\\n)\\n\\n(2020) (holding that the appellant failed to establish a reasonable\\n\\nprobability that the outcome of his trial would have been different if\\n\\nthe State had disclosed information about a witness’s alleged deal,\\n\\nbecause the evidence at trial showed that the witness provided a\\n\\nstatement to the police that was consistent with his testimony\\n\\nmonths before the alleged date on which the witness received a\\n\\nreduced sentence in exchange for his cooperation, and he testified\\n\\nthat he was hoping to receive a reduced sentence due to his\\n\\ncooperation). For these reasons, the alleged evidence that Davis had\\n\\na deal for a 10-year prison sentence (rather than a deal for a\\n\\nsentence that would not exceed 20 years) likely would not have had\\n\\na significant impact on the jury’s assessment of his credibility. See\\n\\nHood, 311 Ga. at 865-866; Harris, 309 Ga. at 606-607.\\n\\n     We now turn to the alleged deal between the State and\\n\\n                                 41\\n McClure. Evidence that McClure had an agreement with the State\\n\\nthat he would not be charged in this case and that he would receive\\n\\nmore favorable treatment in the probation matter likely would have\\n\\nhad some effect on the jury’s appraisal of his credibility, particularly\\n\\nbecause (unlike with Davis) the jury was not aware that McClure\\n\\nhad any express incentive to testify against Sauder. But even if the\\n\\njury had discredited and thus discounted McClure’s testimony, it\\n\\nwould have had little effect on the jury’s view of the evidence at trial\\n\\nas a whole, because his testimony was largely cumulative of other\\n\\nevidence. See Hood, 311 Ga. at 865 (holding that there was not a\\n\\nreasonable probability that the outcome of the appellant’s trial\\n\\nwould have been different if the State had disclosed evidence of a\\n\\nwitness’s alleged deal for a reduced sentence, because the witness’s\\n\\ntestimony was cumulative of other evidence at trial).         See also\\n\\nSullivan v. Lockhart, 958 F2d 823, 825 (8th Cir. 1992) (concluding\\n\\nthat the appellant had not proven that it was reasonably probable\\n\\nthat evidence of a witness’s alleged deal would have affected the\\n\\noutcome of his trial, because the witness’s testimony was cumulative\\n\\n                                  42\\n of other evidence). Specifically, McClure’s testimony about Sauder’s\\n\\ncarrying a large number of coins near the time of the murder was\\n\\ncumulative of Holland’s similar account. McClure’s testimony that\\n\\nSauder had returned to Alexander’s home after the August 4 robbery\\n\\nand had seen his dead body was largely cumulative of Davis’s\\n\\ntestimony to that effect, and Sauder himself indicated during the jail\\n\\nphone call that he was present at the time of the shooting. McClure’s\\n\\ntestimony that Sauder had a metal box with paperwork in it and had\\n\\nthe guns that Melita identified as belonging to Alexander was\\n\\ncumulative of Davis’s testimony that he and Sauder stole a lockbox\\n\\nand guns from Alexander, and McClure’s testimony that Sauder said\\n\\nhe shot a bear was cumulative of Cunningham’s mother’s testimony\\n\\non that point.\\n\\n      We acknowledge that some of McClure’s testimony—about\\n\\nSauder’s carrying coins, returning to Alexander’s home and seeing\\n\\nhis   body,   and   shooting   a   bear—was    also   cumulative    of\\n\\nCunningham’s testimony, and thus corroborated Cunningham’s\\n\\naccount on those points. That corroboration matters in light of\\n\\n                                   43\\n Sauder’s claim, discussed in Division 5 (c), that McClure and\\n\\nCunningham were both accomplices, and that the trial court plainly\\n\\nerred by failing to instruct the jury that an accomplice’s testimony\\n\\nis not sufficient to establish a fact unless it is corroborated. That is:\\n\\nif Cunningham’s testimony had to be corroborated because he was\\n\\nan accomplice, and the only corroboration came from McClure, then\\n\\nevidence that McClure had a deal with the State that would\\n\\nundermine his credibility could qualify as material evidence under\\n\\nBrady.    See Thomas, 311 Ga. at 417-419 (concluding that the\\n\\nappellant established the materiality prong of the Brady test,\\n\\nbecause the State failed to disclose a deal with a witness whose\\n\\ntestimony “‘could be viewed as the most significant piece of\\n\\ncorroborating evidence offered by the State in a case where the\\n\\ncorroborating evidence was both slight and wholly circumstantial’”).\\n\\nBut that was not the case here because, as we discussed above, other\\n\\nindependent evidence corroborated each material aspect of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   44\\n Cunningham’s story.19 Thus, even if the jury had been informed of\\n\\nMcClure’s alleged deal with the State and determined that it\\n\\nrendered his testimony not credible, Cunningham’s testimony was\\n\\namply corroborated. In sum, McClure’s testimony, while helpful to\\n\\nthe State, was not a crucial component of the strong evidence\\n\\nagainst Sauder. Compare Thomas, 311 Ga. at 417-419.\\n\\n      Thus, weighing the evidence as we would expect reasonable\\n\\njurors to have done, we conclude that Sauder has not established a\\n\\nreasonable probability that the evidence of Davis’s and McClure’s\\n\\nalleged deals with the State would have affected the jury’s guilty\\n\\nverdicts. Accordingly, this claim fails. See Hood, 311 Ga. at 865-\\n\\n866; Harris, 309 Ga. at 606-607.\\n\\n      7.   Sauder     contends      that    his   trial   counsel     provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance in several respects. To prevail\\n\\non these claims, Sauder must establish that counsel’s performance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      19 We note that Cunningham’s statement that Sauder got a haircut\\naround the time of the murder was corroborated only by McClure’s testimony\\non that point. But as we discussed above, that statement likely had little effect\\non the jury’s guilty verdicts.\\n                                       45\\n was constitutionally deficient and that he suffered prejudice as a\\n\\nresult. See Strickland v. Washington, \\n466 U.S. 668\\n, 687-695 (104\\n\\nSCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984); Smith v. State, \\n308 Ga. 81\\n, 87 (\\n839\\n\\nSE2d 630\\n) (2020). To prove deficient performance, Sauder must\\n\\nshow that his trial counsel “‘performed at trial in an objectively\\n\\nunreasonable way considering all the circumstances and in the light\\n\\nof prevailing professional norms,’” which requires that Sauder\\n\\novercome the “‘strong presumption’ that trial counsel’s performance\\n\\nwas adequate.” Smith, 308 Ga. at 87 (citations omitted). To prove\\n\\nprejudice, Sauder must establish a reasonable probability that, but\\n\\nfor counsel’s deficient performance, the result of the trial would have\\n\\nbeen different. See Strickland, \\n466 U.S. at 694\\n. “A reasonable\\n\\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\\n\\noutcome.” \\nId.\\n We need not address both parts of the Strickland test\\n\\nif Sauder makes an insufficient showing on one. See Smith, 308 Ga.\\n\\nat 87.\\n\\n     (a) Sauder argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for\\n\\nfailing to present evidence that he claims showed that Cunningham,\\n\\n                                  46\\n McClure, or someone else could have killed Alexander. Specifically,\\n\\nat the hearing on his motion for new trial, Sauder introduced GBI\\n\\nreports noting the following: McClure’s wife told investigators that\\n\\nat some point, Sauder and McClure walked away from the farm and\\n\\nreturned a couple of hours later with coins and “antique\\n\\n‘knickknacks,’” McClure admitted to her that he went with Sauder\\n\\nto Alexander’s property but said he did not go inside the home, and\\n\\nan unidentified man told her that he went to Alexander’s home with\\n\\nSauder and saw Alexander’s dead body; Cunningham initially told\\n\\ninvestigators that the .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle (the murder\\n\\nweapon) belonged to him; McClure’s phone communicated with\\n\\nCunningham’s phone several times and was near the farm and\\n\\nAlexander’s home on the night of August 9; investigators considered\\n\\nMcClure a suspect and had evidence that he was a gang member;\\n\\nMcClure warned his wife not to speak to investigators without a\\n\\nlawyer; Cunningham threatened Holland after she spoke with\\n\\ninvestigators, accusing her of “trying to get him locked up”; and DNA\\n\\ntesting on a hammer found near Alexander’s body contained DNA\\n\\n                                 47\\n profiles from Alexander and an unidentified person, and Sauder,\\n\\nDavis, Cunningham, and McClure were excluded as contributors.\\n\\n     Sauder has failed to establish that counsel’s decision not to\\n\\npresent any of this evidence was so unreasonable that no competent\\n\\nlawyer would have made it under the circumstances. To begin, some\\n\\nof the evidence Sauder points to—including the evidence that\\n\\nSauder and McClure had coins and “knickknacks,” that McClure\\n\\nadmitted he accompanied Sauder to Alexander’s home, and that an\\n\\nunidentified man also went with Sauder to the home and saw\\n\\nAlexander’s body—would have suggested to the jury that Sauder\\n\\nwas guilty, at least as a party to the crimes. Counsel was not\\n\\ndeficient for deciding not to introduce this potentially inculpatory\\n\\nevidence. See, e.g., Smith, 308 Ga. at 91 n.10 (explaining that trial\\n\\ncounsel’s strategy to avoid the introduction of potentially\\n\\ninculpatory evidence was reasonable and rejecting the appellant’s\\n\\nineffective assistance claim).\\n\\n     As for the evidence Sauder claims would have indicated that\\n\\nCunningham or McClure committed the crimes, counsel testified at\\n\\n                                 48\\n the motion for new trial hearing that his theory of defense was that\\n\\nthe State had not established who killed Alexander or shown\\n\\n“beyond a reasonable doubt that it was . . . Sauder” and that he did\\n\\nnot want to “point[] the finger” at any other particular person,\\n\\nbecause that would “run[] the risk of the jury saying no, we’re pretty\\n\\nconvinced that person didn’t have anything to do with it.” Counsel\\n\\nalso testified that he believed there was not enough evidence for him\\n\\nto be able to blame someone else, and that it was better to argue that\\n\\nthe State had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Sauder was\\n\\na principal or a party to the crimes, which was “not an uncommon\\n\\nstrategy of [] defense, depending on the quality of the evidence.” In\\n\\nsupport of that defense theory, trial counsel asserted during his\\n\\nclosing argument that the “big hole” in the State’s case was that no\\n\\none knew what happened when Alexander was murdered; there\\n\\nwere inconsistencies in the State’s evidence; and the State had not\\n\\nsufficiently explained how certain evidence proved Sauder’s guilt.\\n\\nCounsel’s decision to argue that the State failed to prove beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt that Sauder participated in the killing—rather\\n\\n                                 49\\n than presenting specific evidence that might have suggested that\\n\\nCunningham or McClure participated in the crimes but would not\\n\\nhave suggested that Sauder was not also a participant—was\\n\\nobjectively reasonable given the circumstances.       See Kidwell v.\\n\\nState, \\n264 Ga. 427\\n, 432 (\\n444 SE2d 789\\n) (1994) (holding that the\\n\\nappellant’s trial counsel was not deficient for failing to investigate\\n\\nevidence of other crimes committed by his co-indictees, because his\\n\\ndefense theory was that the appellant was not involved in the\\n\\ncharged crimes and had no knowledge of any other crimes). See also\\n\\nLee v. State, Case No. S23A1034, \\n2024 WL 424570\\n, at *8 (decided\\n\\nFeb. 6, 2024) (“‘An attorney’s decision about which defense to\\n\\npresent is a question of trial strategy, and trial strategy, if\\n\\nreasonable, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.’”)\\n\\n(citation omitted).\\n\\n     Finally, counsel’s decision not to introduce evidence showing\\n\\nthat the hammer contained DNA profiles from Alexander and an\\n\\nunidentified person was not unreasonable, particularly because\\n\\nthere was no evidence connecting the hammer to Alexander’s\\n\\n                                 50\\n shooting death. Evidence that an unidentified person may have\\n\\ncome into contact with a hammer in Alexander’s home at some\\n\\nunknown point would not have raised a reasonable inference of\\n\\nSauder’s innocence and would not have directly connected the\\n\\nunidentified person to the crimes. See Payne v. State, \\n314 Ga. 322\\n,\\n\\n333 (\\n877 SE2d 202\\n) (2022) (explaining that “‘[t]his Court has\\n\\nfollowed the general rule that, before testimony can be introduced\\n\\nthat another person committed the charged crime, the proffered\\n\\nevidence must raise a reasonable inference of the defendant’s\\n\\ninnocence and, in the absence of a showing that the other person\\n\\nrecently committed a crime of the same or a similar nature, must\\n\\ndirectly connect the other person with the corpus delicti,’” and\\n\\nholding that trial counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to\\n\\npresent evidence that another person’s DNA was found on a beer\\n\\nbottle at the crime scene, because the evidence that the person may\\n\\nhave been at the crime scene at some unknown point did not raise a\\n\\nreasonable inference of the appellant’s innocence) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     Because Sauder has not shown that his trial counsel performed\\n\\n                                 51\\n deficiently by deciding not to introduce the evidence detailed above,\\n\\nhe cannot establish that counsel was ineffective in this respect.\\n\\n     (b) Sauder claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for\\n\\nfailing to “take basic steps necessary to reveal the deal between the\\n\\nState and [McClure].” But as discussed above in relation to Sauder’s\\n\\nBrady claim, he has not established a reasonable probability that\\n\\nthe outcome of his trial would have been different if the State had\\n\\ndisclosed information about an alleged deal with McClure. Thus,\\n\\neven if his trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to obtain\\n\\nevidence about a deal, Sauder cannot prove prejudice under\\n\\nStrickland. See, e.g., Harris, 309 Ga. at 607 (holding that because\\n\\nthe appellant could not establish the materiality element of his\\n\\nBrady claim, he also could not prove prejudice for his related\\n\\nineffective assistance of counsel claim); Thomas, 311 Ga. at 417\\n\\n(explaining that Brady’s materiality requirement mirrors the test\\n\\nfor determining prejudice in an ineffective assistance claim).\\n\\n     (c) Sauder contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective\\n\\nassistance by failing to cross-examine McClure about the fact that\\n\\n                                 52\\n although he was sentenced for voluntary manslaughter in an\\n\\nunrelated case, he had been charged with malice murder in that\\n\\ncase.    It appears that Sauder argues that counsel should have\\n\\nquestioned McClure about the malice-murder charge in an effort to\\n\\nelicit testimony that would contradict his earlier testimony about\\n\\nthe circumstances underlying his conviction, the seriousness of\\n\\nwhich Sauder claims was “minimized.” Sauder points to McClure’s\\n\\ntestimony on direct examination that in the other case, he was “slap-\\n\\nboxing” with the victim; they then engaged in “an actual fist fight”;\\n\\nMcClure’s wife tried to intervene and the victim slapped her; the\\n\\nvictim pulled out a knife and stabbed McClure three times; and\\n\\nMcClure stabbed him once, killing him.\\n\\n        We conclude that evidence that McClure was initially charged\\n\\nwith malice murder in that case would have had little, if any,\\n\\nprobative value to contradict his testimony about the facts related\\n\\nto the knife fight or to disprove his claim that he was acting in self-\\n\\ndefense. See, e.g., Olds v. State, \\n299 Ga. 65\\n, 75 (\\n786 SE2d 633\\n) (2016)\\n\\n(explaining that “the greater the tendency to make the existence of\\n\\n                                  53\\n a fact more or less probable, the greater the probative value”). Nor\\n\\nwould evidence of the malice-murder charge have been probative to\\n\\nshow McClure’s bias in testifying for the State.      McClure was\\n\\nindicted for malice murder in the other case in 2008 and agreed to\\n\\nplead guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 2009—more than seven\\n\\nyears before the crimes at issue in this case occurred and nearly 10\\n\\nyears before Sauder’s trial—so the malice-murder charge was no\\n\\nlonger pending and had been resolved for several years when\\n\\nMcClure testified in this case. Moreover, McClure testified about\\n\\nhis conviction for voluntary manslaughter and that he was still\\n\\nserving a probated sentence for that crime—and we have already\\n\\naddressed Sauder’s claim that McClure made a deal with the State\\n\\nfor lenient treatment in his probation revocation matter.\\n\\n     Accordingly, we cannot say that trial counsel performed\\n\\ndeficiently by not asking McClure about the malice-murder charge\\n\\nin the other case, because it was not probative to contradict his\\n\\ntestimony about the underlying facts of the crime in that case or to\\n\\nshow his bias in testifying. See, e.g., Moore v. State, \\n315 Ga. 263\\n,\\n\\n                                54\\n 269 (\\n882 SE2d 227\\n) (2022) (explaining that “[t]he scope of an\\n\\nattorney’s cross-examination is ‘grounded in trial tactics and\\n\\nstrategy, and will rarely constitute ineffective assistance of\\n\\ncounsel,’” and holding that trial counsel did not perform deficiently\\n\\nby failing to cross-examine witnesses about the sentences they faced\\n\\non charges that were pending at the time of trial, because the\\n\\nevidence showed that the witnesses had not received any benefit as\\n\\nto those charges in exchange for their testimony) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     (d) Sauder claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing\\n\\nto request jury instructions on circumstantial evidence, mere\\n\\npresence, and knowledge.      As discussed above with respect to\\n\\nSauder’s claims that the trial court plainly erred by allegedly\\n\\nomitting these instructions, the court properly instructed the jury\\n\\non the substance of OCGA § 24-14-6 (the circumstantial evidence\\n\\nstatute), and other instructions in the jury charge adequately\\n\\ncovered the concepts of mere presence and knowledge.           Thus,\\n\\ncounsel did not perform deficiently in this regard. See, e.g., Kimbro\\n\\nv. State, \\n317 Ga. 442\\n, 456 (\\n893 SE2d 678\\n) (2023) (concluding that\\n\\n                                 55\\n trial counsel was not deficient for failing to object to the omission of\\n\\na jury instruction on mere presence, because the trial court\\n\\ninstructed the jury on the presumption of innocence, the State’s\\n\\nburden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element\\n\\nof the charged crimes, circumstantial evidence, and criminal intent);\\n\\nDowney v. State, \\n298 Ga. 568\\n, 574 (\\n783 SE2d 622\\n) (2016) (holding\\n\\nthat trial counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to object to\\n\\nthe omission of a jury instruction on knowledge, because other\\n\\ninstructions sufficiently covered that concept); Pruitt v. State, \\n282\\n\\nGa. 30\\n, 34 (\\n644 SE2d 837\\n) (2007) (explaining that trial counsel’s\\n\\nfailure to object to jury instructions that were “correct statements of\\n\\nthe law” was not deficient performance).20\\n\\n\\n      20 Sauder also briefly asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing\\n\\nto expressly mention to the jury the concepts of circumstantial evidence, mere\\npresence, and knowledge with respect to the August 9 or 10 crimes, and that\\ncounsel should have pursued a defense of mere presence as to those crimes.\\nBut trial counsel essentially pointed to the circumstantial nature of the\\nevidence as to the August 9 or 10 crimes during his closing argument and\\nrepeatedly asserted that the State failed to prove Sauder’s guilt beyond a\\nreasonable doubt, which was not a patently unreasonable strategy under the\\ncircumstances. Thus, Sauder cannot prove that his counsel performed\\ndeficiently in this way, either. See Davenport v. State, \\n283 Ga. 171\\n, 175 (\\n656\\nSE2d 844\\n) (2008) (explaining that defense counsel “is given wide latitude in\\n\\n                                       56\\n      (e) Sauder argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing\\n\\nto request an accomplice-corroboration instruction as to the August\\n\\n9 or 10 crimes. Even assuming that counsel performed deficiently,\\n\\nSauder cannot establish prejudice for the same reasons discussed\\n\\nabove with respect to his related plain-error claim. See Payne, 314\\n\\nGa. at 329 (explaining that “‘[t]his Court has equated the prejudice\\n\\nstep of the plain error standard with the prejudice prong for an\\n\\nineffective assistance of counsel claim’”) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     (f) Sauder claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for\\n\\nfailing to object or move for a mistrial when the prosecutor made\\n\\nstatements that, he claims, misled the jury about the law of parties\\n\\nto a crime. We disagree.\\n\\n     By way of background, the State’s theory of the case at trial\\n\\nwas that Sauder shot Alexander, but the prosecutor also argued in\\n\\nclosing that even if the evidence indicated that Sauder and “a buddy”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmaking closing arguments” and that trial counsel is not ineffective “simply\\nbecause another attorney might have used different language or placed a\\ndifferent emphasis on the evidence”) (citation and punctuation omitted). See\\nalso Lee, \\n2024 WL 424570\\n, at *8.\\n                                    57\\n perpetrated the shooting, the jury would be authorized to find\\n\\nSauder guilty as a party to the crimes. The prosecutor said, among\\n\\nother things, that party-to-a-crime liability “means if you were\\n\\nintentionally helping in a crime, then you’re part of the whole thing”;\\n\\nthat Sauder admitted that he “was present” when Alexander was\\n\\nshot; and that Sauder may have “provided” the murder weapon to\\n\\nthe shooter. Sauder now argues that these statements improperly\\n\\nimplied that the jury would be authorized to find him guilty as a\\n\\nparty to all of the charged crimes even if he committed only some of\\n\\nthem and even if he was merely present at the crime scene.\\n\\n     The prosecutor’s statements, taken in context, did not\\n\\nmisrepresent the law. Under OCGA § 16-2-20 (b) (3), a person is a\\n\\nparty to a crime if he “[i]ntentionally aids or abets in the commission\\n\\nof the crime.” The prosecutor’s explanation that a person is a party\\n\\nif he was “intentionally helping in a crime” essentially conveyed that\\n\\npoint. And a reasonable juror likely would have understood the\\n\\nprosecutor’s following reference to being “part of the whole thing” as\\n\\nan assertion that someone who intentionally helps commit a crime\\n\\n                                  58\\n is part of that particular crime, because immediately before and\\n\\nafter that statement, the prosecutor’s arguments focused only on\\n\\nparty-to-a-crime liability regarding the murder.\\n\\n     In addition, by mentioning Sauder’s presence at the crime\\n\\nscene and his potentially providing the murder weapon to the\\n\\nshooter, the prosecutor pointed to reasonable inferences from the\\n\\nevidence supporting Sauder’s involvement in the murder. Indeed,\\n\\nthe prosecutor also argued that the evidence showed that the .22-\\n\\ncaliber semiautomatic rifle was the murder weapon, that Sauder\\n\\npurchased it, and that he had it with him in the days surrounding\\n\\nthe shooting. See, e.g., Howard, \\n2024 WL 1160574\\n, at *3 (explaining\\n\\nthat “a jury may infer a defendant’s criminal intent, and thereby\\n\\nfind him guilty as a party to a crime, ‘from his presence,\\n\\ncompanionship, and conduct before, during, and after the offense’”)\\n\\n(citation omitted). The prosecutor did not argue that the jury would\\n\\nbe authorized to find that Sauder was a party to the crimes even if\\n\\nhe lacked the requisite criminal intent to commit them. Moreover,\\n\\nthe prosecutor told the jurors that the trial court would instruct\\n\\n                                59\\n them on the law of parties to a crime, and during the final charge,\\n\\nthe trial court accurately instructed on that legal concept and\\n\\ncriminal intent. The court also advised the jury that the lawyers’\\n\\nclosing arguments were not evidence.\\n\\n     Because the prosecutor’s statements, viewed in the context of\\n\\nhis argument as a whole, were not improper, Sauder’s trial counsel\\n\\ndid not perform deficiently by not objecting to them or moving for a\\n\\nmistrial on that basis. See Faulkner v. State, \\n295 Ga. 321\\n, 326-327\\n\\n(\\n758 SE2d 817\\n) (2014) (holding that trial counsel was not deficient\\n\\nfor failing to object to the prosecutor’s statement that the jury could\\n\\nfind the appellant guilty as a party to the crimes “because he aided\\n\\nor abetted the commission of those crimes when he helped the\\n\\nshooter move [the victim], rob him, and get away,” as that statement\\n\\nwas not legally improper, and noting that even if an objection might\\n\\nhave had some merit, a reasonable lawyer could have decided to rely\\n\\non the trial court’s charge on parties to a crime, rather than make\\n\\nan objection of questionable merit). See also Lee, 317 Ga. at 887\\n\\n(explaining that this Court considers closing arguments in context;\\n\\n                                  60\\n prosecutors are granted “‘wide latitude’” in closing argument and\\n\\nmay “‘argue reasonable inferences from the evidence’”; and\\n\\n“‘[w]hether to object to a particular part of a prosecutor’s closing\\n\\nargument is a tactical decision, and counsel’s decision not to make\\n\\nan objection must be patently unreasonable to rise to the level of\\n\\ndeficient performance’”) (citations omitted).21\\n\\n      8. Sauder contends that the combined prejudicial effect of the\\n\\n\\n      21   Sauder also baldly asserts in his brief that his trial counsel was\\nineffective because he “failed to make the adversarial testing process work at\\ntrial,” failed “to formulate or articulate a theory of defense,” failed “to make an\\neffective opening statement,” failed “to cross-examine the State’s witnesses\\neffectively,” failed “to point out weaknesses in the State’s evidence,” failed\\n“to present available evidence which would have raised doubt concerning\\n[Sauder’s] guilt,” failed “to object to inadmissible evidence offered by the State,”\\nfailed “to object to improper statements made by the [prosecutor] in closing\\nargument,” failed “to request jury instructions to support the theory of defense\\nobviously presented by the evidence,” failed to object “to incorrect or incomplete\\njury instructions,” failed “to articulate the obvious defense presented by the\\nevidence (mere presence at the scene of a crime),” and failed “to make an\\neffective closing argument.” To the extent Sauder has not identified specific\\ninstances of these alleged deficiencies, he has not carried his burden of showing\\nthat his lawyer performed deficiently. See, e.g., Wallace v. State, \\n296 Ga. 388\\n,\\n392 (\\n768 SE2d 480\\n) (2015) (holding that the appellant had not shown that his\\ntrial counsel performed deficiently by failing to file a motion to suppress\\nidentification evidence, because he did not specify which witnesses gave\\nobjectionable testimony or why it was inadmissible and explaining that “‘[i]t is\\nnot this Court’s job to cull the record on behalf of the [appellant] to find alleged\\nerrors’”) (citation omitted). And in any event, Sauder makes no specific\\nargument and cites no authority to support any of these claims, so we do not\\naddress them. See Former Supreme Court Rule 22; Sinkfield v. State, Case\\nNo. S23A1201, \\n2024 WL 922867\\n, at *11 n.11 (decided Mar. 5, 2024).\\n                                        61\\n errors and deficiencies he alleges entitles him to a new trial. See\\n\\nState v. Lane, \\n308 Ga. 10\\n, 17 (\\n838 SE2d 808\\n) (2020). As discussed\\n\\nabove, we have assumed (without deciding) that the trial court\\n\\ncommitted a clear and obvious error by failing to give an accomplice-\\n\\ncorroboration instruction as to the August 9 or 10 crimes; that\\n\\ncounsel performed deficiently by failing to request such an\\n\\ninstruction; that the State suppressed evidence of deals with Davis\\n\\nand McClure; and that counsel was deficient for failing to discover\\n\\nMcClure’s deal. Even assuming that the alleged instructional error\\n\\nand alleged suppression under Brady are the sorts of errors that\\n\\ncould be assessed cumulatively—an issue we need not decide here—\\n\\nSauder has not established a reasonable probability that these\\n\\nassumed defects and deficiencies, taken together, affected the\\n\\noutcome of his trial.\\n\\n     As we have explained, an accomplice-corroboration instruction\\n\\nprobably would not have altered the jury’s verdicts as to the crimes\\n\\non August 9 or 10, because Cunningham’s and McClure’s testimony\\n\\nwas amply corroborated by other, independent evidence. The jury\\n\\n                                 62\\n learned that Davis had a substantial deal with the State and that\\n\\nhe had given investigators a statement that was consistent with his\\n\\ntestimony long before any deal had arisen, so additional evidence\\n\\nabout the deal likely would not have swayed the jury. And although\\n\\nevidence of an alleged deal between the State and McClure may\\n\\nhave helped Sauder discredit McClure, his testimony was\\n\\ncumulative of other evidence and thus was not critical to prove\\n\\nSauder’s guilt or to corroborate Cunningham’s account of the August\\n\\n9 or 10 crimes. In sum, it is not reasonably probable that the\\n\\nminimal prejudice from these assumed defects and deficiencies, even\\n\\nif viewed together, affected the outcome of Sauder’s trial,\\n\\nparticularly in light of the other significant evidence of his guilt.\\n\\nSee, e.g., Hood, 311 Ga. at 867-868 (assuming without deciding that\\n\\nthe alleged suppression of a deal between a witness and the State\\n\\nunder Brady and the trial court’s alleged clear error in failing to give\\n\\na confession-corroboration instruction should be assessed together\\n\\nunder Lane and concluding that the appellant had not established\\n\\ncumulative prejudice, “[g]iven the quantum and strength of the\\n\\n                                  63\\n evidence, independent of [the witness’s] testimony and corroborative\\n\\nof any single confession [the appellant] made”).\\n\\n     9. Finally, although Sauder does not raise the issue, we have\\n\\nnoticed a merger error with respect to his sentencing. The jury\\n\\nfound Sauder guilty of two counts of possession of a firearm during\\n\\nthe commission of a felony (based on aggravated assault and\\n\\nburglary) on August 4, and three counts of possession of a firearm\\n\\nduring the commission of a felony (based on malice murder,\\n\\naggravated assault, and burglary) on August 9 or 10. The trial court\\n\\nsentenced him to serve five consecutive years in prison each for four\\n\\nof the firearm-possession counts (based on burglary on August 4 and\\n\\nmalice murder, aggravated assault, and burglary on August 9 or 10)\\n\\nand merged the firearm-possession count based on aggravated\\n\\nassault on August 4. The court erred by sentencing Sauder on the\\n\\nfirearm-possession count based on aggravated assault on August 9\\n\\nor 10.\\n\\n     Under OCGA § 16-11-106 (b) (1) and (2), a person commits the\\n\\ncrime of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony if\\n\\n                                 64\\n he has “on or within arm’s reach of his . . . person a firearm . . .\\n\\nduring the commission of” certain felonies, including “[a]ny crime\\n\\nagainst or involving the person of another” or “[t]he unlawful entry\\n\\ninto a building or vehicle.” And as to sentencing, we have explained\\n\\nthat “where multiple crimes are committed together during the\\n\\ncourse of one continuous crime spree, a defendant may be convicted\\n\\nonce for possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime as\\n\\nto every individual victim of the crime spree, as provided under\\n\\nOCGA § 16-11-106 (b) (1), and additionally once for firearm\\n\\npossession for every crime enumerated in subsections (b) (2) through\\n\\n(5).” State v. Marlowe, \\n277 Ga. 383\\n, 386 (\\n589 SE2d 69\\n) (2003). As to\\n\\nthe crime spree on August 9 or 10, the trial court should have\\n\\nsentenced Sauder for only one of the firearm-possession counts\\n\\nrelated to Alexander (as well as the count related to burglary), so\\n\\nthe court erred by failing to merge the firearm-possession count\\n\\nbased on aggravated assault into Sauder’s conviction for firearm-\\n\\npossession based on malice murder. We therefore vacate Sauder’s\\n\\nconviction and sentence for possession of a firearm during the\\n\\n                                65\\n commission of the felony of aggravated assault. See, e.g., Welch, 309\\n\\nGa. at 880-881 (vacating the appellant’s conviction and sentence for\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of the felony of\\n\\naggravated assault of the victim, because it should have merged into\\n\\nhis conviction for firearm-possession based on the malice murder of\\n\\nthe victim).22\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed in part and vacated in part. All the Justices\\nconcur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      22 We note that the trial court also erred by merging the firearm-\\npossession count based on aggravated assault on August 4. But that error\\nbenefited Sauder; the State has not raised it by cross-appeal; and we see no\\nexceptional circumstances that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to\\ncorrect it. See Dixon v. State, \\n302 Ga. 691\\n, 696-698 (\\n808 SE2d 696\\n) (2017)\\n(explaining that even when no party raises a merger error, we have discretion\\nto correct it on direct appeal, but when the error benefits the defendant and\\nthe State fails to raise it by cross-appeal, we exercise our discretion to correct\\nthe error only in exceptional circumstances).\\n                                       66\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9497884/sauder-v-state/'}),\n",

THE STATE.\\n\\n        LAGRUA, Justice.\\n\\n        In these appeals—which have been consolidated for purposes\\n\\nof issuing an opinion—we decide whether an indictment charging\\n\\ntwo former police officers with violations of their oaths of office\\n\\nunder OCGA § 16-10-1 by failing to conduct investigations of other\\n\\npolice officers in purported violation of Brady v. Maryland, \\n373 U.S.\\n\\n83\\n (83 SCt 1194, 10 LE2d 215) (1963), is sufficient to withstand the\\n\\ngeneral demurrers filed in the case below.1 For the reasons that\\n\\nfollow, we conclude that the indictment at issue is not sufficient to\\n\\nwithstand the general demurrers and violates federal constitutional\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 OCGA § 16-10-1 provides that “[a]ny public officer who willfully and\\n\\nintentionally violates the terms of his oath as prescribed by law shall, upon\\nconviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more\\nthan five years.”\\n due process, and thus, the trial court’s order denying the general\\n\\ndemurrers to the indictment should be reversed.\\n\\n      1.

Maryland.”\\n\\nPowell and Scott also asserted that the oath-of-office statute, OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-10-1, was “unconstitutionally vague” as applied to the facts of\\n\\nthis case.\\n\\n      At the hearing on the general demurrers, Powell and Scott\\n\\n\\n\\nOCGA § 17-7-170. The special demurrers were denied by the trial court and\\nare not before us on appeal. As for the speedy-trial demands, in October 2022,\\nPowell and Scott filed motions to dismiss the indictment, seeking to be\\ndischarged and acquitted of all charges because they were not tried during the\\nSeptember 2021 term of court or the next term of court, which began in March\\n2022 and ended in September 2022. In November 2022, the trial court held a\\nhearing on the motions to dismiss and subsequently denied the motions. In\\ndenying the motions, the trial court determined, among other findings, that\\nPowell and Scott failed to serve the assigned judge with their speedy-trial\\ndemands and that OCGA § 17-7-170 (a) “specifically requires a defendant [to]\\nserve his speedy-trial demand on both the prosecutor and the judge to whom\\nthe case is assigned.” The trial court concluded that, “[b]ecause Powell and\\nScott failed to strictly comply with the statute, they made no demand for\\nspeedy trial,” and their motions should be denied.\\n                                      6\\n argued that the indictment should be dismissed because they could\\n\\nadmit all the facts alleged therein and not be guilty of any crimes.\\n\\nTo that end, Powell and Scott again argued that the indictment fails\\n\\nto allege any facts constituting a crime; fails to allege any conduct\\n\\namounting to a Brady violation; and fails to identify a particular\\n\\ncase or a particular defendant whose case has been affected by a\\n\\nBrady violation or whose federal constitutional rights have been\\n\\nviolated. The State argued that “[t]here were numerous cases of\\n\\npeople denied their liberty” or “denied their life” by the acts and/or\\n\\nomissions of Powell and Scott, but the State did not identify any such\\n\\ncases. In response, Powell and Scott reiterated that the State had\\n\\nfailed to specify any pending criminal cases that had allegedly been\\n\\nimpacted by a Brady violation on their part, and they argued that\\n\\ntheir federal due process rights would be violated if the State was\\n\\nallowed “to stray from the terms of the indictment” by prosecuting\\n\\nthem based upon cases, actions, or incidents that were not included\\n\\nin the indictment.\\n\\n     The trial court denied the general demurrers, concluding that,\\n\\n                                  7\\n if Powell and Scott were to admit the allegations in the indictment,\\n\\nthe “admission of these allegations would constitute conduct\\n\\nviolative of the oaths of office taken by [Powell and Scott]” and\\n\\nfurther determining that, even if “the underlying conduct charged\\n\\nwas not per se criminal under Georgia law, . . . the conduct alleged,\\n\\nif proven true, would constitute conduct not only grossly\\n\\ninconsistent with that imposed upon [Powell and Scott] by their\\n\\noaths, but also going to the very heart of the obligations they\\n\\nassumed when they took their oaths.” 4\\n\\n      2. We review a trial court’s ruling on a general demurrer “de\\n\\nnovo in order to determine whether the allegations in the indictment\\n\\nare legally sufficient.” State v. Mondor, \\n306 Ga. 338\\n, 341 (1) (830\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 Citing Poole v. State, \\n262 Ga. 718\\n, 719 (\\n425 SE2d 655\\n) (1993), the trial\\n\\ncourt also concluded that OCGA § 16-10-1 was “not unconstitutionally vague\\nas applied to Powell and Scott” and denied their general demurrers on this\\nadditional ground. Powell and Scott appealed the trial court’s ruling—\\nincluding the trial court’s conclusion that OCGA § 16-10-1 was not\\nunconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case—to the Court of\\nAppeals. In their appeals, Powell and Scott also sought review of the trial\\ncourt’s denial of their motions to dismiss the indictment on speedy-trial\\ngrounds. After observing that these appeals invoked our Court’s constitutional\\nquestion jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals transferred the appeals to this\\nCourt in October 2023.\\n  8\\nSE2d 206\\n) (2019) (citation and punctuation omitted). Having done\\n\\nso, we agree with Powell and Scott that the trial court’s ruling\\n\\nregarding the sufficiency of the indictment was erroneous, and their\\n\\ngeneral demurrers should have been granted.\\n\\n     “As a general matter, a demurrer (whether general or special)\\n\\nmust allege some flaw on the face of the indictment itself,” and “a\\n\\ncourt cannot go beyond the four corners of the indictment in\\n\\nconsidering a demurrer.” State v. Williams, \\n306 Ga. 50\\n, 53 (2) (\\n829\\n\\nSE2d 117\\n) (2019). See also Bullard v. State, \\n307 Ga. 482\\n, 486 (2) n.5\\n\\n(\\n837 SE2d 348\\n) (2019) (noting that “the trial court could not look\\n\\nbeyond the four corners of the indictment in considering [the\\n\\ndefendant’s] demurrer”).\\n\\n     To assess the merits of a general demurrer, which\\n     challenges the sufficiency of the substance of the\\n     indictment, a court asks whether the defendant can admit\\n     each and every fact alleged in the indictment and still be\\n     innocent of any crime. If so, the general demurrer should\\n     be sustained. But if the admission of the facts alleged\\n     would lead necessarily to the conclusion that the accused\\n     is guilty of a crime, the indictment is sufficient to\\n     withstand a general demurrer.\\n\\nWilliams, 306 Ga. at 52 (2) (citation and punctuation omitted;\\n\\n                                 9\\n emphasis in original). Framed another way, this Court has held\\n\\nthat, if an indictment “recite[s] the language of the statute that sets\\n\\nout all the elements of the offense charged or allege[s] the facts\\n\\nnecessary to establish a violation of a criminal statute, then the\\n\\nindictment is sufficient to withstand a general demurrer.” Mondor,\\n\\n306 Ga. at 341 (1) (citing Jackson v. State, \\n301 Ga. 137\\n, 141 (1) (\\n800\\n\\nSE2d 356\\n) (2017)).\\n\\n     Here, the indictment lays out the elements of the statutorily-\\n\\ndefined crime of violation of oath of office by a public officer. See\\n\\nOCGA § 16-10-1 (“[a]ny public officer who willfully and intentionally\\n\\nviolates the terms of his oath as prescribed by law shall, upon\\n\\nconviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment for not less than\\n\\none nor more than five years.”). The indictment also specifies which\\n\\nterm of the oath of office Powell and Scott allegedly violated—their\\n\\nobligation “to uphold the Constitution of the United States”—and\\n\\nwhich specific provision thereof—Article VII, Amendment V of the\\n\\nUnited States Constitution as interpreted by the United States\\n\\nSupreme Court in Brady v. Maryland, \\n373 U.S. 83\\n (83 SCt 1194, 10\\n\\n                                  10\\n LE2d 215) (1963). As such, the indictment satisfies the general\\n\\ndemurrer standard as set forth in Mondor and Jackson insofar as it\\n\\n“recite[s] the language of the statute that sets out all the elements\\n\\nof the offense charged.”    Mondor, \\n306 Ga. at 341\\n (1).      See also\\n\\nJackson, \\n301 Ga. at 139\\n (1) (“[T]o withstand a general demurrer, an\\n\\nindictment must . . . recite the language of the statute that sets out\\n\\nall the elements of the offense charged[.]”).\\n\\n     However, under these circumstances, if the indictment here\\n\\nonly recited “the language of the statute that sets out all the\\n\\nelements of the offense charged”—and therefore satisfied the\\n\\ngeneral demurrer standard, Mondor, 306 Ga. at 341 (1)—the\\n\\nindictment would not be sufficient to withstand a special demurrer,\\n\\nwhich “challenges the sufficiency of the form of the indictment.”\\n\\nKimbrough v. State, \\n300 Ga. 878\\n, 880 (2) (\\n799 SE2d 229\\n) (2017)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis in original). “By filing\\n\\na special demurrer, the accused claims . . . that the accused is\\n\\nentitled to more information.”     \\nId. at 880-881\\n (2) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). When considering an indictment under a\\n\\n                                  11\\n special demurrer challenge,\\n\\n      [w]e have held that an indictment not only must state the\\n      essential elements of the offense charged, but it also must\\n      allege the underlying facts with enough detail\\n      to sufficiently apprise the defendant of what he must be\\n      prepared to meet. As we have explained, when a court\\n      considers whether an indictment is sufficient to\\n      withstand a special demurrer, it is useful to remember\\n      that a purpose of the indictment is to allow a defendant\\n      to prepare her defense intelligently.\\n\\nId. at 881\\n (2) (citations and punctation omitted; emphasis supplied).5\\n\\n      Applying those principles here, the indictment at issue charges\\n\\nPowell and Scott with “willfully and intentionally” violating the\\n\\nterms of their oath of office under OCGA § 16-10-1 by failing to\\n\\nuphold the due process clause of the United States Constitution as\\n\\ninterpreted by Brady. Brady stands for the proposition that “the\\n\\nsuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused\\n\\nupon request violates due process where the evidence is material\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 Here, it appears that the State reindicted Powell and Scott after the\\n\\ntrial court granted special demurrers on the first indictment for a lack of\\nsufficient underlying facts, resulting in the indictment presently at issue. The\\nfirst indictment is not part of the record in this case; however, the procedural\\nhistory of that indictment was referenced at the general demurrer hearing in\\nJanuary 2022.\\n                                      12\\n either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad\\n\\nfaith of the prosecution.” Brady, \\n373 U.S. at 87\\n. This Court has\\n\\nexplained that Brady “does not require the pre-trial disclosure of\\n\\nexculpatory evidence,” Davis v. State, \\n261 Ga. 382\\n, 385 (8) (b) (\\n405\\n\\nSE2d 648\\n) (1991) (citation omitted; emphasis supplied), and does not\\n\\nimpose a duty upon the State to investigate. See Brown v. State, \\n250\\n\\nGa. 66\\n, 74 (6) (\\n295 SE2d 727\\n) (1982); Hines v. State, \\n249 Ga. 257\\n,\\n\\n258-259 (1) (\\n290 SE2d 911\\n) (1982); Baker v. State, \\n245 Ga. 657\\n, 661-\\n\\n662 (3) (\\n266 SE2d 477\\n) (1980); Rini v. State, \\n236 Ga. 715\\n, 718 (4)\\n\\n(\\n225 SE2d 234\\n) (1976); Hicks v. State, \\n232 Ga. 393\\n, 394-395 (\\n207\\n\\nSE2d 30\\n) (1974). We have held that, for a criminal defendant to\\n\\nestablish a Brady violation, the following four factors must be met:\\n\\n     (1) the State possessed evidence favorable to [the\\n     accused’s] defense; (2) [the accused] did not possess the\\n     favorable evidence and could not obtain it himself with\\n     any reasonable diligence; (3) the State suppressed the\\n     favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been\\n     disclosed to the defense, a reasonable probability exists\\n     that the outcome of the trial would have been different.\\n\\nDavis v. State, \\n316 Ga. 418\\n, 425 (4) (c) (\\n888 SE2d 546\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n                                  13\\n      As explained above, to withstand a general demurrer in this\\n\\ncase, the State was not required to allege any additional facts in the\\n\\nindictment beyond the statutory elements of OCGA § 16-10-1, but\\n\\nthe State generally must allege additional facts to survive a special\\n\\ndemurrer. Here, the State alleged additional facts, but those facts—\\n\\nnamely, that Powell and/or Scott violated the terms of their oaths of\\n\\noffice by committing Brady violations through their failures to\\n\\ninvestigate and undertake the administrative actions alleged in\\n\\nCount 1 through 4 of the indictment—are inconsistent with the\\n\\ncriminal statute as pleaded and negate the manner in which Powell\\n\\nand Scott purportedly violated the terms of their oaths of office. In\\n\\nother words, here, the indictment alleges that Powell and Scott\\n\\ncommitted these crimes in a specific way. If Powell and Scott admit\\n\\nto that, they are still innocent of the alleged crimes because it is\\n\\nlegally impossible to commit the crimes in the way the State alleged\\n\\nin the indictment.\\n\\n     When we review the sufficiency of an indictment, “we read the\\n\\nindictment as a whole.” Sanders v. State, \\n313 Ga. 191\\n, 196 (3) (a)\\n\\n                                 14\\n (ii) (\\n869 SE2d 411\\n) (2022). We most often rely on this principle to\\n\\nuphold an indictment where one count does not include sufficient\\n\\ndetails, but those details are provided in other counts of the\\n\\nindictment. See \\nid.\\n (determining that an indictment survived a\\n\\ndemurrer because, although the conspiracy count of the indictment\\n\\nfailed to identify a co-conspirator or overt act in furtherance of the\\n\\nconspiracy, “the alleged deficiencies [were] addressed” in another\\n\\ncount of the indictment). See also State v. Wyatt, \\n296 Ga. 257\\n, 260-\\n\\n261 (1) (b) (\\n759 SE2d 500\\n) (2014) (observing that “[w]e will consider\\n\\neach felony murder count and its underlying felony count together,\\n\\nand examine whether the entirety of the indictment provides\\n\\nsufficient detail about the crimes [the defendant] is accused of\\n\\ncommitting” so as to put the defendant on notice of what he will have\\n\\nto defend against at trial). However, here, this principle leads us to\\n\\nconclude that, where the details provided in each count actually\\n\\nnegate the elements of the crimes charged, the indictment is not\\n\\nsufficient to withstand a general demurrer because Powell and Scott\\n\\n“can admit each and every fact alleged in the indictment and still be\\n\\n                                 15\\n innocent of” the crimes alleged by the State. Williams, 306 Ga. at\\n\\n52 (2). And, although we have not articulated this specific rule\\n\\nbefore, it is consistent with our case law.\\n\\n      Accordingly, in this case—even assuming (without deciding)\\n\\nthat a Brady violation could form the basis of a violation of oath of\\n\\noffice charge—the facts as alleged in this indictment do not support\\n\\nsuch a charge because Powell’s and Scott’s purported failures to\\n\\ninvestigate and undertake the administrative actions alleged in\\n\\nCounts 1 through 4 of the indictment are not Brady violations. 6 See\\n\\nDavis, \\n261 Ga. at 385\\n (8) (b). See also Mondor, \\n306 Ga. at 341\\n (1).\\n\\nWe thus conclude that the indictment against Powell and Scott\\n\\n“cannot withstand a general demurrer,” Mondor, \\n306 Ga. at 341\\n (1)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted), and therefore, the trial court’s\\n\\ndenial of Powell’s and Scott’s general demurrers to the indictment is\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 Although we must accept all factual allegations as true, the State’s\\n\\nallegations that this conduct violated Brady are conclusions of law, which we\\nare not required to accept. See Wyatt, \\n295 Ga. at 267-268\\n (3) (“[I]n reviewing\\ndemurrers, the allegations in the indictment are taken as true[.]”) (citing Lowe\\nv. State, \\n276 Ga. 538\\n, 539 (\\n579 SE2d 728\\n) (2003) (explaining that the court\\nmust take the allegations in the indictment as true when evaluating a\\ndemurrer)).\\n                                      16\\n reversed. And, because we have concluded that this indictment\\n\\ncannot withstand a general demurrer, we need not reach Powell’s\\n\\nand Scott’s constitutional challenge or the speedy-trial issue also\\n\\nbefore us on appeal. 7\\n\\n      Judgment reversed.

On the first appearance of the case, DeKalb County v. McFarland, 223 Ga. 196 (154 SE2d 203), this court merely held that if a petition alleges a cause of action for any relief it will withstand a general demurrer and that in this instance the petition did allege a cause of action for legal relief. Thereafter, on the trial of the case the lower court eliminated the equitable and injunctive features of the case and allowed the jury only to consider the question of damages to the petitioner for a set period of time. Held:\\n1. The lower court erred in not allowing the petitioner to prove *619 his case as alleged and in not allowing the jury to consider the question of whether or not the plaintiff was entitled to equitable relief to stop the alleged trespass and nuisance which was continuing in nature upon his property. A question of fact was shown as to whether or not these governmental agencies named as defendants had concentrated and collected surface water in greater quantity than in prior years and caused it to flow upon or back up upon the lot of the plaintiff in greater quantity and in a manner different from that in which the waters had been received from the upper areas by gravitation. Such activity would be a continuing nuisance authorizing a court of equity to restrain it and to require the defendants to cease and desist until and unless it was condemned for public purposes. The court erred in failing to charge on the injunctive features of the case. Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. v. Bohler, 98 Ga. 184 (26 SE 739); Cox v. Martin, 207 Ga. 442 (62 SE2d 164); Rinzler v. Folsom, 209 Ga. 549, 552 (74 SE2d 661).\\n2. The court erred in refusing to allow the evidence in support of petitioner's amendments as to damages occurring since the filing of the suit inasmuch as the case was one in equity and in restricting the damages to a definite time, since the court had before it the entire case at the time in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits. The measure of damages cannot be determined until it has been established that (1) there exists a nuisance and continuing trespass; and (2) it is not temporary and not abatable but permanent. These issues determine the charge on the measure of damages. Danielly v. Cheeves, 94 Ga. 263, 269 (21 SE 524); Langley v. City Council of Augusta, 118 Ga. 590, 591 (45 SE 486, 98 ASR 133); City of Macon v. Roy, 34 Ga. App. 603 (130 SE 700). Therefore the court erred in ruling out the consideration of the special damages both in the original petition and in the amendments. Mitchell County v. Hudspeth, 151 Ga. 767 (108 SE 305).\\n3. While the municipal authorities may have obtained an easement to dump surface water on plaintiff's property, nevertheless it would not have the right to increase the quantity of water amounting to the destruction of the plaintiff's property; and all charges in support of the right of the municipal authorities to maintain and build streets, sewers and drainage systems would have no bearing on the case since the case is *620 not one in tort for negligence but for the resulting alleged nuisance. The court erred in charging on the duty of the municipalities, discretionary acts, proper maintenance and construction and negligence. Ingram v. City of Acworth, 90 Ga. App. 719 (84 SE2d 99); City Council of Augusta v. Marks, 124 Ga. 365 (52 SE 539); Bell v. Mayor of Savannah, 139 Ga. 298 (77 SE 165); Bass Canning Co. v.

The map of the streets of Decatur which showed the location of the property in question and the surrounding streets was properly identified for the purposes for which it was offered in evidence and it should not have been excluded because the maker stated he had revised it from an earlier plat which he failed to prepare and did not measure the distances to determine their accuracy. Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. v. City of Atlanta, 134 Ga. 871 (2) (68 SE 703). The court erred in excluding the map as evidence.\\n5. The other grounds alleging error by the court in refusing to charge are either argumentative, were as to matter already covered in the charge, or may not occur again on a new trial; hence no further ruling will be made on these alleged errors in refusing to give the requested charges. However, for all the reasons stated above a new trial will be required.\\nJudgment reversed.

JACKSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       WARREN, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Derylmyaize Jackson was convicted of felony murder\\n\\nand a firearm offense in connection with the shooting death of\\n\\nTazavia Cooper. 1 In his sole claim on appeal, Jackson contends that\\n\\nhis trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object\\n\\nto statements that the prosecutor made during her closing\\n\\nargument. As explained below, we affirm.\\n\\n\\n       1 Cooper was killed on July 5, 2019.   In October 2020, a Thomas County\\ngrand jury indicted Jackson for felony murder based on aggravated assault,\\naggravated assault, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\nfelony. At a trial from June 28 to 30, 2021, a jury found him guilty of all counts.\\nThe trial court sentenced Jackson to serve life in prison without the possibility\\nof parole for felony murder and five consecutive years for the firearm offense;\\nthe aggravated-assault count merged for sentencing purposes. Jackson filed a\\ntimely motion for new trial, which he later amended through new counsel.\\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion in August 2023.\\nJackson then filed a timely notice of appeal, and the case was docketed to the\\nterm of this Court beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision\\non the briefs.\\n      1. The evidence presented at Jackson’s trial showed the\\n\\nfollowing. On July 5, 2019, Jackson and Cooper exchanged text\\n\\nmessages in which Jackson offered to trade his “[G]lock” handgun\\n\\nfor Cooper’s “[K]el [T]ec” gun. Around 1:15 p.m., Cooper arrived on\\n\\nFeinberg Street in Thomasville, where he and Jackson had arranged\\n\\nto meet.\\n\\n     According to Tahrik Anderson, he and Jackson were hanging\\n\\nout on Feinberg Street when two men, whom Anderson did not know\\n\\nbut whom investigators later identified as David McNair and\\n\\nCooper, arrived in a car. Jackson began “acting weird”; he walked\\n\\nto the driver-side window and discussed “exchang[ing] guns” with\\n\\nCooper, who pulled out a Kel-Tec handgun. Jackson pulled out a\\n\\nblack handgun, which Cooper examined. McNair then got out of the\\n\\npassenger seat, urinated on the ground, got back in the car, and\\n\\nreached down toward the floorboard. Jackson fired shots toward\\n\\nCooper, grabbed the Kel-Tec handgun from Cooper’s lap, and ran\\n\\naway. Anderson fled with Jackson. Although Anderson testified\\n\\nthat he was “in fear of [his] life” because he thought McNair was\\n\\n                                2\\n reaching for a gun, Anderson also testified that he did not hear\\n\\nCooper or McNair threaten Jackson and he did not see McNair with\\n\\na weapon.2\\n\\n     McNair called 911. Investigators who responded to the scene\\n\\nfound Cooper, who had been shot once on the left side of his head,\\n\\nslumped over the center console of the car, dead. McNair was sitting\\n\\non a nearby curb, crying. Investigators did not find any weapons at\\n\\nthe scene, and they did not see any weapons on McNair.3 A crime\\n\\nscene investigator found three Luger 9mm shell casings on the\\n\\nground near the car, which she testified indicated that one gun was\\n\\nfired three times. Based on the location of two bullet holes in the\\n\\nback driver-side window and the position of Cooper’s body on the\\n\\ncenter console, the investigator concluded that the first shot was\\n\\nfired through the open driver-side window, hitting Cooper, who was\\n\\nlikely sitting upright (rather than leaning toward the driver-side\\n\\n\\n     2 On direct examination, Anderson testified that during an interview\\n\\nwith investigators on the day after the shooting, he untruthfully said that\\nJackson shot because McNair “pulled a gun.”\\n\\n     3 McNair did not testify at trial.\\n\\n                                          3\\n window), and causing him to slump over the console; the second and\\n\\nthird shots were then fired through the back driver-side window,\\n\\nindicating that the shooter moved from the driver-side window\\n\\ntoward the back of the car as he shot.\\n\\n     After the shooting, a friend picked up Jackson and Anderson\\n\\nand drove them to a nearby apartment complex. A woman who was\\n\\nat the complex testified that Jackson looked “scared” and said that\\n\\nhe “need[ed] some bleach, [he] just killed someone.” According to\\n\\nAnderson, someone then drove him and Jackson to a friend’s house.\\n\\nJackson had the Kel-Tec handgun there, but Anderson did know\\n\\nwhat ultimately happened to that gun or the gun Jackson used to\\n\\nshoot Cooper. Investigators never recovered the guns. Jackson\\n\\nturned himself in at a police station later that evening.\\n\\n     Jackson did not testify at trial. His theory of defense was that\\n\\nthe State could not meet its burden of proving that he did not act in\\n\\nself-defense.\\n\\n     2.   Jackson   contends    that   his   trial   counsel   provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to object during the\\n\\n                                  4\\n prosecutor’s closing argument. Specifically, Jackson points to the\\n\\nprosecutor’s following statements to the jury, while discussing the\\n\\nState’s burden of proof: “[W]hat it all boils down to, is what your\\n\\nheart and your mind tell you about the evidence. If you find in your\\n\\nheart and your mind that you believe Derylmyaize Jackson\\n\\ncommitted these offenses, then you are authorized to return a\\n\\nverdict of guilty.” Relying primarily on Debelbot v. State, 308 Ga.\\n\\n165 (839 SE2d 513) (2020), in which we held that the appellants’\\n\\ntrial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the\\n\\nprosecutor’s “‘egregious misstatement of the law’” “that proof beyond\\n\\na reasonable doubt requires something less than proof that leaves a\\n\\njury with 51 percent certainty,” Jackson claims that the prosecutor’s\\n\\nstatements here similarly reduced the State’s burden to prove the\\n\\ncharged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.          Id. at 167 (citation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance, Jackson must\\n\\nestablish that his counsel’s performance was constitutionally\\n\\ndeficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result. See Strickland\\n\\n                                   5\\n v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674)\\n\\n(1984); Scott v. State, 317 Ga. 218, 221 (892 SE2d 744) (2023). To\\n\\nprove deficient performance, Jackson must show that his lawyer\\n\\n“‘performed his duties in an objectively unreasonable way,\\n\\nconsidering all the circumstances and in the light of prevailing\\n\\nprofessional norms.’” Id. (citation omitted). To prove prejudice,\\n\\nJackson must demonstrate “‘that there is a reasonable probability\\n\\nthat, but for counsel’s deficiency, the result of the trial would have\\n\\nbeen different.’” Id. at 221-222 (citation omitted). “A reasonable\\n\\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\\n\\noutcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\\n\\n     Assuming (without deciding) that Jackson’s trial counsel\\n\\nperformed deficiently by failing to object to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nstatements about reasonable doubt, Jackson has not established a\\n\\nreasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been\\n\\ndifferent if counsel had objected, so he has not shown prejudice. See\\n\\nScott, 317 Ga. at 222 (explaining that if a defendant fails to make a\\n\\nsufficient showing on one part of the Strickland test, we need not\\n\\n                                  6\\n address the other part).\\n\\n           As we have explained in decisions after Debelbot,\\n     that case involved a specific set of circumstances that\\n     made the prosecutor’s comments about reasonable doubt\\n     uniquely prejudicial. It was already a close question\\n     whether the underwhelming and almost entirely\\n     circumstantial evidence was legally sufficient. That\\n     evidence was unusual in that it showed that the two\\n     defendants had essentially equal opportunities—and no\\n     one else had any opportunity at all—to inflict the fatal\\n     injuries, so the logical probability that either [defendant]\\n     inflicted the fatal trauma would be 50 percent. And, given\\n     that peculiarity, the prosecutor’s suggestion that the jury\\n     could convict a defendant even if it was less than 51\\n     percent sure about the defendants’ guilt was uniquely\\n     harmful. Finally, the trial court’s instruction in Debelbot\\n     that the State is not required to prove its case to “a\\n     mathematical certainty,” a phrase which the State\\n     repeated twice, may well have been understood by the\\n     jury not as correcting the State’s error, but as reinforcing\\n     it.   Absent those unique circumstances, defendants\\n     seeking to establish prejudice from a prosecutor’s\\n     comments that do not accurately characterize reasonable\\n     doubt cannot simply rest on Debelbot.             Instead, a\\n     defendant asserting an ineffective-assistance claim like\\n     the one here must show how a prosecutor’s particular\\n     mischaracterization of reasonable doubt likely affected\\n     how a jury weighed the evidence of his guilt under the\\n     circumstances of his case (and in doing so, show how\\n     objecting to the comments would have created a\\n     reasonable probability of a different outcome).\\n\\nScott, 317 Ga. 225-226 (cleaned up).\\n\\n\\n                                  7\\n      Here, although the statements that Jackson points to, if viewed\\n\\nin isolation, may have misinformed the jurors that they would be\\n\\nauthorized to find Jackson guilty if they believed in their “heart[s]”\\n\\nand their “mind[s]” that he was guilty—rather than if the State\\n\\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element of the\\n\\ncharged crimes—Jackson makes no specific argument as to how\\n\\nthese statements affected the outcome of his trial, in light of the\\n\\nevidence of his guilt, other statements that the prosecutor made\\n\\nduring closing, and the trial court’s instructions to the jury. Given\\n\\nthe facts of his case, however, we have no difficulty concluding that\\n\\nthis case is distinguishable from Debelbot. To begin, unlike the\\n\\nevidence in Debelbot, the evidence of Jackson’s guilt was not\\n\\n“underwhelming,” because the State presented significant proof to\\n\\nrebut his claim of self-defense. In this respect, Anderson testified\\n\\nthat Jackson shot Cooper and then stole his gun, Anderson did not\\n\\nhear Cooper or McNair threaten Jackson, and McNair did not have\\n\\na gun. Investigators did not find any weapons at the scene or see\\n\\nany weapons on McNair, and the ballistics evidence suggested that\\n\\n                                  8\\n only one gun was fired at the time of the shooting, indicating that\\n\\nneither Cooper nor McNair shot toward Jackson. And although\\n\\nJackson eventually turned himself in to law enforcement officials,\\n\\nhe fled the crime scene just after the shooting and told a witness\\n\\nthat he needed “bleach” because he had “just killed someone.” See,\\n\\ne.g., Scoggins v. State, 317 Ga. 832, 838 (896 SE2d 476) (2023)\\n\\n(noting that flight from the scene of a crime generally can be viewed\\n\\nas circumstantial evidence of guilt).\\n\\n     Moreover, before the prosecutor made the statements at issue\\n\\nhere, she accurately explained that “[t]he burden of proof is always\\n\\non the State to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt.” She\\n\\nalso correctly characterized reasonable doubt as “not arbitrary or\\n\\ncapricious doubt. It’s not a far[-]flung doubt. It’s not a doubt for\\n\\nwhich you can give a mathematical certainty, but it is a doubt of a\\n\\nfair and impartial minded juror honestly seeking the truth. It is a\\n\\ndoubt for which you can give a reason.” In addition, she told the\\n\\njurors that the trial court would instruct them on the law that\\n\\napplied to the case, and the trial court did so. To that end, during\\n\\n                                  9\\n the final jury charge, the trial court thoroughly and properly\\n\\ninstructed the jury on the presumption of innocence, the State’s\\n\\nburden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element\\n\\nof the crimes charged, and the definition of reasonable doubt.4 The\\n\\ncourt then stated, among other things, that it was the court’s duty\\n\\nto instruct the jury on the law, that the jury was bound by such\\n\\ninstructions, that the jury had the responsibility to determine the\\n\\nfacts from the evidence presented and to apply the law to the facts,\\n\\nand that the lawyers’ closing arguments were not evidence.\\n\\n     Thus, to the extent that the prosecutor mischaracterized the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 As to the definition of reasonable doubt, the court said:\\n\\n            A reasonable doubt means just what it says. A reasonable\\n     doubt is a doubt of a fair-minded, impartial juror honestly seeking\\n     the truth. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon common sense\\n     and reason. It does not mean a vague or arbitrary doubt but is a\\n     doubt for which a reason can be given, arising from a consideration\\n     of evidence, a lack of evidence, or a conflict in the evidence.\\n            Now, after giving consideration to all of the facts and\\n     circumstances of this case, if your minds are wavering, unsettled,\\n     or unsatisfied, then that is a doubt of the law, and you must acquit\\n     the defendant. But, if that doubt does not exist in your minds as\\n     to the guilt of the accused, then you would be authorized to convict\\n     the defendant. If the State fails to prove the defendant’s guilt\\n     beyond a reasonable doubt, it would be your duty to acquit the\\n     defendant.\\n                                      10\\n reasonable doubt standard, we cannot say that it was as egregious\\n\\nas the characterization in Debelbot and, unlike in that case, the\\n\\nstatements here were corrected by the trial court’s jury instructions.\\n\\nEspecially given that the evidence of guilt was stronger in this case\\n\\nthan in Debelbot, Jackson has not shown a reasonable probability\\n\\nthat his lawyer’s failure to object to the prosecutor’s statements\\n\\naffected the outcome of his trial, and this claim fails. See, e.g., Scott,\\n\\n317 Ga. 225-226 (assuming that the appellant’s trial counsel\\n\\nperformed deficiently by failing to object to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nstatement during closing argument that “[o]nce you believe that the\\n\\ndefendant is guilty, that is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” among\\n\\nother things, and holding that the appellant failed to show prejudice\\n\\nbecause the evidence of his guilt was strong, the prosecutor told the\\n\\njury that the trial court would instruct on the law, and the court\\n\\nthoroughly instructed the jury on the burden of proof, the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, and reasonable doubt); Warren v.

Mathews, Arthur K. Bolton, Attorney General, Isaac Byrd, Assistant Attorney General, Harvey Koenig, for appellees.\\nHALL, Justice.\\nThis appeal presents a constitutional challenge to the Metropolitan River Protection Act (Ga. L. 1973, p. 128 et seq., as amended by Ga. L. 1975, p. 837), and the Chattahoochee Corridor Study, authorized by the River Act and adopted by the City of Atlanta. Atlanta Regional Commission, Chattahoochee Corridor Study (1972).\\nThe Metropolitan River Protection Act (\"River Act\") permits a planning commission for a metropolitan area with a population of one million or more persons to develop a comprehensive plan for land and water use along stream corridors when a stream supplies forty percent or more of the water for the metropolitan area. River Act, § 4. A \"stream corridor\" is all land within 2,000 feet of the water course. Sec. 2 (e). The planning commission is also authorized to develop plans for the fifty-year flood plain of the stream, land which probably will be flooded once every fifty years. Sec. 2 (f).\\nThe Chattahoochee River provides most of the water for the City of Atlanta, and the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) developed a comprehensive plan for the 48 mile long stream corridor from Buford Dam to Peachtree Creek. The Commission divided the stream corridor into 23 sections, each of which was analyzed and mapped according to six factors to determine which land was vulnerable to damage by development and which land was suitable for development. Those factors were geology, hydrology, soils, vegetation, slope and aspect. ARC also ranked proposed land uses from recreational use through thirteen housing types to commercial and industrial developments according to the effect of the land *332 use on the land. When the land vulnerability study and the study on effects of development were combined, the result was a development plan which allocated land uses by matching types of development with land best suited for the development.\\nEven though ARC developed the Corridor Study, the Commission has no enforcement powers. After a political subdivision adopts the Corridor Study, land or water use inconsistent with the Study is forbidden. A use is deemed inconsistent until the political subdivision issues a certificate of compliance for any clearing, construction, excavation or filling in the stream corridor. After issuance of the certificate, ARC reviews the certificate and may recommend modification if it finds that the proposed use is inconsistent with the Corridor Study. The political subdivision may accept the Commission\\'s recommendation, override it or request reconsideration of the proposed use. River Act, §§ 5, 6.\\nMinimum standards for the certificate with respect to the subject river\\'s fifty-year flood plain and the area within 150 feet of the watercourse are specified in the Act. Uses within these overlapping areas are restricted to those uses \"not harmful to the water and land resources of the stream corridor . . . [which do not] significantly impede the natural flow of flood waters, and [which] will not result in significant land erosion, stream bank erosion, siltation or water pollution.\"[1] River Act, § 8. Agricultural and animal husbandry uses as well as ordinary maintenance and landscaping are exempt from the Act\\'s restrictions. River Act, § 12.\\nARC has developed further standards for the flood plain and the area within 150 feet of the watercourse. Grading and vegetation clearance permits are required; cut and fill operations which would alter the natural flow *333 of flood waters are not permitted. Only twenty percent of the flood plain may be covered by an impervious structure. Corridor Study, pp. 54-55.\\nAppellant Pope owns a 3.7 acre tract of land bordering on the Chattahoochee River, which contains a house, driveway, man-made lake and swimming pool. Pope began construction of a tennis court within the stream corridor without a certificate of compliance from the City of Atlanta. The city issued a stop-work order because the tennis court was an impervious structure partially within the flood plain and within 150 feet of the river. The tennis court also required filling and the construction of a retaining wall.\\nAfter issuance of the stop-work order, appellant sought a declaratory judgment from federal district court that the River Act was unconstitutional, but the federal court upheld the statute. Pope v. City of Atlanta, 418 Supp. 665 (N.D. Ga. 1976), affd. mem., 575 F2d 298 (5th Cir. 1978). Appellant then pressed her claim in the Superior Court of Fulton County. On cross appeals from the first decision of the superior court, this court held that Pope\\'s state constitutional claims were not barred by the resjudicata effect of the federal suit and that the River Act was not an unconstitutional attempt by the Georgia legislature to exercise local zoning power. Pope v. City of Atlanta, 240 Ga. 177 (240 SE2d 241) (1977). On remand, Pope asserted that because the River Act and Corridor Study prevented the construction on her property of a tennis court, the River Act and Corridor Study unconstitutionally appropriated private property for public use without compensation. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and the Corridor Study. We affirm.\\nThe inherent police power of the state extends to the protection of the lives, health and property of the citizen, and to the preservation of good order and public morals and is not subject to any definite limitations, but is coextensive with the necessities of the case and the safeguard of public interest. McCoy v. Sanders, 113 Ga. App. 565 (148 SE2d 902) (1966). Further, in the area of environmental legislation, the state Constitution specifically authorizes the General Assembly \"to provide *334 restrictions upon land use in order to protect and preserve the natural resources, environment and vital areas of this State.\" Code Ann. § 2-1404. Appellant contends that the city\\'s failure to permit her to construct a tennis court is, per se, a taking of property like eminent domain. This position misconceives the law.\\nThe distinction between use of eminent domain and use of the police power is that the former involves the taking of property because it is needed for public use while the latter involves the regulation of the property to prevent its use in a manner detrimental to the public interest. 1 Nichols, The Law of Eminent Domain § 1.42 (3d Ed. 1976). Many regulations restrict the use of property, diminish its value or cut off certain property rights, but no compensation for the property owner is required. Among the valid regulations of property are abatement of nuisances, Davis v. Stark, 198 Ga. 223 (31 SE2d 592) (1944); Mack v. Westbrook, 148 Ga. 690 (98 S.E. 339) (1919); zoning, Barrett v. Hamby, 235 Ga. 262 (219 SE2d 399) (1975); health regulations, Vinson v. Home Builders Assn., 233 Ga. 948 (213 SE2d 890) (1975) and building standards, Reed v. White, 207 Ga. 623 (63 SE2d 597) (1951). This court tests regulation of property to determine that the government has not exceeded its police power, for excessive regulation of property violates the due process clause, Code Ann. § 2-101, and the prohibition against taking property for public use without compensation. Code Ann. § 2-301. In Vinson v. Home Builders Assn., supra, this court stated that exercise of the police power was subject to the limitation that the ordinance bear some \"reasonable relation\" to the public health. In Barrett v. Hamby, supra, this reasonableness standard was further articulated as the requirement that a zoning classification \"may only be justified if it bears a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morality or general welfare.\" 235 Ga. at 265. This approach essentially balances the state\\'s interest in regulation against the landowner\\'s interest in the unfettered use of his property. We adopt a balancing test for the type of police power restriction on property involved in this case.[2]*335 Several other states also measure land use restrictions with a balancing test. E.g., Maple Leaf Investors, Inc. v. State Dept. of Ecology, 88 Wash, 2d 726 (565 P2d 1162) (1977); Turnpike Realty Co. v. Town of Dedham, 362 Mass. 221 (284 NE2d 891) (1972), cert. den., 409 U.S. 1108 (93 SC 908, 34 LE2d 689) (1973).\\nThe interests advanced by the City of Atlanta for these restrictions on appellant\\'s property relate to the public health and safety. Sediment is a major pollutant in the Chattahoochee River. Soil erosion not only damages the land, but the soil carried into the river increases the cost of water treatment and reduces channel capacity, p. 54. Clearing vegetation, grading or cut and fill operations which alter the natural elevation or slope of the land may increase surface water run-off and soil erosion. Further, the construction of impervious structures in the flood plain or within 150 feet of the watercourse means that rain water can not be absorbed by the earth. Surface water run-off, soil erosion and the risk of flooding are thus increased. Corridor Study, p. 55. Requiring permits for grading and vegetation clearance, prohibiting cut and fill operations which alter the natural elevation and limiting the construction of impervious structures are reasonable means of guarding against the dangers of soil erosion, sedimentation and increased flooding. River Act, § 4.\\nWhen the state\\'s interests in preventing flooding, halting land erosion and protecting the water supply are weighed against appellant\\'s interest in constructing her tennis court within 150 feet of the river, the state\\'s interests weigh heavier in the balance. The dangers which flow from overintensive stream corridor development may render some property unsuitable for development, and the state is entitled to recognize this *336 fact. Although one tennis court might affect the river only slightly, the state is justified in considering the cumulative effect of development when it makes land use plans. Thus, the City of Atlanta and the state have engaged in valid land use regulation and have not appropriated appellant\\'s land for public use without compensation.\\nThe experience of other state courts in reviewing land use development plans buttresses our conclusion in this case. In a case quite similar to our own the Supreme Court of Washington upheld the refusal to grant building permits for single family homes in the Cedar River flood plain, even though seventy percent of the appellant\\'s land was in the flood plain. Maple Leaf Investors v. State Dept. of Ecology, 88 Wash. 2d 726, supra. The Massachusetts Supreme Court upheld flood plain restrictions in Turnpike Realty Co. v. Town of Dedham, 362 Mass. 221, supra. In that case, the court held that land had not been unconstitutionally taken even though its uses were restricted to woodland, wetland, grassland or recreational use which did not require filling because of the necessity of flood plain zoning to reduce damage to life and property.\\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court, using a different rationale, reached a similar result in Just v. Marinette County, 56 Wis. 2d 7 (201 NW2d 761) (1972). The court upheld restrictions on land use within 1,000 feet of lakes or within 300 feet of navigable streams on the ground that the landowner had no right to use his land to the detriment of the public. This approach was also followed in Sibson v. State, 115 N. H. 124 (336 A2d 239) (1975), upholding a tidal wetlands Act. Similarly, Maryland\\'s Supreme Court, through analogy to public nuisance law, upheld a coastal land use Act and the denial of a dredging permit, reasoning that regulation or restraint of a use of land that would be injurious to the rights of the public is a valid exercise of the police power. Potomac Sand & Gravel Co. v. Gov. of Maryland, 266 Md. 358 (293 A2d 241), cert. den., 409 U.S. 1040 (93 SC 525, 34 LE2d 490) (1972).\\nAppellant has cited several cases in which land use development plans were held unconstitutional. One of these, Morris County Land Improvement Co. v. Parsippany-Troy Hills, 40 N. J. 539 (193 A2d 232) (1963), *337 is easily distinguishable. In that case, zoning of petitioner\\'s land for agricultural purposes was held unconstitutional as a ploy to keep the land in its natural state and its price depressed until the state or national government could condemn it for a flood control project. Further, the court noted that a zoning ordinance was involved, not land use restrictions enacted pursuant to the exercise of other police powers. 40 N. J. 546, n.1. Our case also does not involve zoning but land use restrictions necessary for the public health and safety which presumably would be valid in New Jersey as well. See Fred v. Mayor &c. of Old Tappan, 10 N. J. 515 (92 A2d 473) (1952).\\nAlthough Dooley v. Town Plan & zoning Comm., 151 Conn. 304 (197 A2d 770) (1964), invalidated land use zoning as applied to Dooley\\'s land, the case is read narrowly by its court which upheld the denial of a permit to fill tidal wetlands in Brecciaroli v. Conn. Comr. of Env. Protection, 168 Conn. 349 (362 A2d 948) (1975).\\nAppellant also relies heavily upon Justice Holmes\\' opinion in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (43 SC 158, 67 LE 322) (1922). The essence of that opinion is that the state ran afoul of the Constitution by denying to the mining company the entire value of its rights in the land. The mining company sold the surface rights in the property but retained the right to mine coal without liability for damage caused by the mining. The Pennsylvania legislature then forbade mining that would endanger surface support for streets or homes. Since coal mining causes subsidence, the coal company would be unable both to mine and to comply with the legislation. The Supreme Court held that a \"taking\" had occurred because the legislature had, in essence, stripped the company of all its rights \\x97 the contract right to mine and the property right to subsurface minerals. Pope cannot fit herself within the rationale of Mahon because the River Act and Corridor Study only regulate her use of her property and do not deprive her of all her rights in the property.\\nA similar objection can be made to appellant\\'s reliance on Pumpelly v. Green Bay &c. Co., 80 U.S. 166 (20 LE 557) (1871). The government permanently flooded *338 Pumpelly\\'s land when it dammed a river for flood control. The Supreme Court found that all reasonable use of Pumpelly\\'s land was taken by the flooding. Pope may use her land within the exceptions of Section 12 of the River Act or when she demonstrates that her use will not \"result in significant land erosion, stream bank erosion, situation or water pollution.\" River Act, § 8.\\nWe therefore find that the River Act and Corridor Study do not violate the Constitution of Georgia.\\nJudgment affirmed. All the Justices concur, except Jordan, Bowles, and Marshall, JJ., who dissent.\\nNOTES\\n[1] We read the River Act to apply identical provisions to the flood plain and to the area within 150 feet of the watercourse since these areas overlap. This is ARC\\'s interpretation of its enabling Act, and this interpretation is given great weight. Undercofler v. Eastern Air Lines, 221 Ga. 824 (147 SE2d 436) (1966).\\n[2] The type of land use restriction involved in this case is unlike zoning; therefore, the factors suggested in Guhl v. Holcomb Bridge Rd. Corp., 238 Ga. 322 (232 SE2d 830) (1977), for testing the reasonableness of zoning ordinances are inapplicable here.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1247775/pope-v-city-of-atlanta/'}),\n",

HUBER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Andrew Thomas Huber was convicted of felony\\n\\nmurder predicated on aggravated assault in relation to the shooting\\n\\ndeath of Daniel Raburn.1 On appeal, Huber argues that the evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n        1Raburn died on July 3, 2020. On May 28, 2021, a Laurens County\\ngrand jury indicted Huber, as a party to the crimes, for malice murder (Count\\n1), felony murder predicated on aggravated assault (Count 2), and three counts\\nof aggravated assault against Raburn (Counts 3-5). Huber’s accomplices\\nThomas Wayne Harper and Brandilee Nicole Woodard-Brady were separately\\nindicted on the same charges. Prior to Huber’s trial, Harper was tried and\\nconvicted of voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault, and Woodard-\\nBrady entered a guilty plea to voluntary manslaughter. At a trial from October\\n4 through 7, 2022, a jury found Huber not guilty of malice murder but guilty\\nof all the remaining counts against him. The trial court sentenced Huber to\\nlife in prison without the possibility of parole for felony murder; the aggravated\\nassault counts were merged for sentencing purposes.\\n        Huber filed a timely motion for new trial on October 28, 2022, which was\\nthrice amended by new counsel on May 8, May 31, and June 9, 2023. Following\\na hearing on May 30, 2023, the trial court denied Huber’s motion for new trial,\\nas amended, on August 3, 2023. Huber filed a timely notice of appeal on\\nAugust 24, 2023, and the case was docketed to the term of this Court beginning\\nin December 2023 and thereafter submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n was insufficient to support his felony murder conviction, his trial\\n\\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance on various grounds, and the\\n\\ntrial court committed plain error in instructing the jury on simple\\n\\nassault and voluntary manslaughter. For the reasons that follow,\\n\\nwe affirm.\\n\\n     Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, the\\n\\nevidence at trial showed that Huber had been friends with Brandilee\\n\\nWoodard-Brady for many years and was temporarily living with her\\n\\nand her fiancé, Raburn. Raburn and Woodard-Brady’s relationship\\n\\nwas “rocky” and “toxic,” and she had previously gotten a temporary\\n\\nprotective order against him but later had it rescinded. Thomas\\n\\nHarper was a mutual friend of Huber and Woodard-Brady, and\\n\\nHarper had also occasionally spent time with Raburn but “didn’t\\n\\nreally know” him. On July 4, 2020, law enforcement officers arrived\\n\\nat Raburn and Woodard-Brady’s house for a welfare check, where\\n\\nofficers found Raburn’s body lying in the yard with multiple\\n\\nlacerations and abrasions and a gunshot wound to the head. Police\\n\\ncontacted Woodard-Brady that same day and questioned her at the\\n\\n                                2\\n police station.\\n\\n     At the interview, Woodard-Brady told police that she “didn’t\\n\\nknow what had happened.” Detectives later questioned Woodard-\\n\\nBrady again at her sister’s house, and at that point, she admitted\\n\\nthat she knew Huber and Harper had beat up Raburn but said “they\\n\\nwasn’t supposed to kill him.” After Woodard-Brady was arrested,\\n\\nshe asked to speak to a detective again, and at that point, she\\n\\nadmitted that she had asked Huber and Harper over to the house to\\n\\n“beat [Raburn’s] a**.” When police arrested Harper, they found a\\n\\ngun at his residence, and Harper admitted at trial that he shot\\n\\nRaburn with it. And when police arrested Huber and processed his\\n\\ncar, they found bloody clothes behind a speaker, and he admitted\\n\\nthat the bloody clothes were the clothes he was wearing when\\n\\nRaburn was shot. DNA analysis revealed that the blood on Huber’s\\n\\nclothes belonged to Raburn.\\n\\n     At trial, Woodard-Brady testified that on July 3, 2020, she and\\n\\nRaburn got into a verbal altercation at their home and he pushed\\n\\nher, so she texted Huber, “[b]eat his a**,” after which, Huber and\\n\\n                                 3\\n Harper came to the house.       According to Woodard-Brady, she\\n\\nremained in the house, but she saw Huber and Harper pull up,\\n\\nheard “noises,” and “figured that [Huber and Harper] were beating\\n\\n[Raburn] up.” She also stated that though she called Huber and\\n\\nHarper over to beat up Raburn, she “wasn’t expecting them to go to\\n\\nthat extreme.” She testified that after the beating, she went outside\\n\\nlong enough to see Raburn laying on the ground and that “I thought\\n\\nhe had just – that he was either knocked out or passed out, I did not\\n\\nknow that he had been shot and killed.” She testified that after\\n\\nHuber and Harper left, she also left and went to a friend’s house to\\n\\nstay the night and that she never checked on Raburn or called 911.\\n\\nAccording to her friend, when Woodard-Brady arrived, Woodard-\\n\\nBrady immediately began drinking tequila from the bottle and\\n\\nasked her friend to punch her in the face so that she had an alibi.\\n\\nWoodard-Brady also admitted on direct examination that she had\\n\\npleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in relation to Raburn’s\\n\\ndeath. On cross-examination, Huber’s counsel elicited testimony\\n\\nfrom Woodard-Brady that she regularly abused alcohol and drugs,\\n\\n                                 4\\n and that her “story changed each time” she talked to the police.\\n\\n     Harper testified that Woodard-Brady never contacted him to\\n\\ncome over and beat up Raburn. According to Harper, when he and\\n\\nHuber arrived at Raburn and Woodard-Brady’s house, Raburn was\\n\\nholding a wrench and Huber got out of the car and “exchanged\\n\\nwords” with Raburn before Raburn told Huber to “get that n****r\\n\\nout of his yard,” which angered Harper, who exited the car. Raburn\\n\\nthen dropped the wrench and “got into an altercation” with Huber,\\n\\nand the two men fought on the ground before Raburn got up,\\n\\n“rushed” Harper, and tackled him, causing Harper’s gun to fall out\\n\\nof his pocket. Harper said that he and Raburn then fought with each\\n\\nother and “tussled over the gun” before Harper gained control of it\\n\\nand shot Raburn as Raburn continued to hurl racial slurs at Harper;\\n\\nHuber then drove Harper away.        Harper further testified that\\n\\nalthough Harper shot Raburn, Harper did not cause any other\\n\\n“lacerations” or “indentations” on Raburn’s head, so Huber must\\n\\nhave caused those injuries.\\n\\n     Huber also testified at trial. According to Huber, on July 3,\\n\\n                                 5\\n Woodard-Brady texted him that Raburn was “acting unusual,” so he\\n\\ntold her he would come by and “check on them.” Huber drove Harper\\n\\nto the house, and they went inside to speak with Woodard-Brady\\n\\nbefore Huber walked back outside to talk to Raburn; Huber\\n\\ndescribed Raburn as “fine.” So, Huber went back inside, where he\\n\\nsaw Woodard-Brady and Harper kissing. Huber and Harper then\\n\\nleft, but later that day, Woodard-Brady called Huber, crying,\\n\\ncausing Huber to drive back to the house with Harper.\\n\\n     According to Huber, when he and Harper arrived back at the\\n\\nhouse, Raburn was sitting in his car drinking a beer, and after he\\n\\nsaw them pull up, he got out of his car while holding a tire iron and\\n\\nat one point, yelled, “[g]et that n****r out of my yard.” Huber and\\n\\nHarper got out of Huber’s car, and a verbal altercation began\\n\\nbetween Harper and Raburn. Harper asked Raburn why he would\\n\\nneed the tire iron, and Raburn said he didn’t and threw it down.\\n\\nHuber testified that after he noticed Raburn and Harper were\\n\\n“getting more heated,” Huber approached Raburn, and Huber and\\n\\nRaburn began “tussl[ing]” and “rolled around in the grass,” as\\n\\n                                 6\\n Raburn was “trying to put [Huber] in a headlock.” Huber said that\\n\\nhe and Raburn “broke apart,” Raburn “calmed down a little bit,” and\\n\\nHuber began to walk away, but as he walked toward his car, Huber\\n\\nheard a “clink” and “froze” because he thought it might be somebody\\n\\ngetting hit with a bottle and it scared him. Huber testified that\\n\\n“[a]fter that, out of my peripheral, I could see that Raburn stumbled\\n\\nfor, like, a second and then he turned around and rushed Harper”\\n\\nand “got Harper on his back.”         According to Huber, “they were\\n\\nstruggling over something in their hands,” and Harper yelled “get\\n\\nhim off of me, get him off of me,” so Huber grabbed Raburn and\\n\\npulled him off Harper. Huber testified that he then walked back to\\n\\nhis car, and that was when he heard a gunshot.2 Harper then ran\\n\\ntoward the car and told Huber to “get the F in the car,” so they both\\n\\ngot in, and Huber drove them away. As Huber drove them away,\\n\\nHarper said “lights out” and told him “the same thing could happen\\n\\nto [Huber].”   Huber dropped Harper off and did not go back to\\n\\nRaburn and Woodard-Brady’s house. Neither Huber, Harper, nor\\n\\n\\n     2 Huber testified that Harper “always toted a gun.”\\n\\n                                     7\\n Woodard-Brady called 911 for help or to report the incident.\\n\\n     A neighbor who was in her home at the time of the incident\\n\\ntestified that she heard voices arguing, including a man yelling\\n\\n“b***h, did you call me a n****r,” followed by a loud noise, then a\\n\\nwoman screaming, and finally a car driving away.\\n\\n     1.   Huber contends that the evidence presented at trial was\\n\\ninsufficient to support his conviction for felony murder predicated\\n\\non aggravated assault. We disagree.\\n\\n      When this Court evaluates the constitutional sufficiency of the\\n\\nevidence, “we review whether the evidence presented at trial, when\\n\\nviewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdicts, enabled the\\n\\njury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the\\n\\ncrimes of which [he] was convicted.” Fitts v. State, \\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 141\\n\\n(3) (\\n859 SE2d 79\\n) (2021) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n,\\n\\n319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979)). “This limited\\n\\nreview leaves to the jury the resolution of conflicts in the evidence,\\n\\nthe weight of the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and\\n\\nreasonable inferences to be made from basic facts to ultimate facts.”\\n\\n                                  8\\n Muse v. State, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n, 647 (2) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     “A person commits the offense of murder when, in the\\n\\ncommission of a felony, he or she causes the death of another human\\n\\nbeing irrespective of malice.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (c). “Felony murder\\n\\nrequires only that the defendant possessed the requisite criminal\\n\\nintent to commit the underlying felony — in this case, aggravated\\n\\nassault, which also does not require intent to kill.” Mathews v. State,\\n\\n314 Ga. 360\\n, 365 (1) (\\n877 SE2d 188\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). Under the relevant part of Georgia’s aggravated assault\\n\\nstatute, “[a] person commits the offense of aggravated assault when\\n\\nhe or she assaults: . . . [w]ith a deadly weapon or with any object,\\n\\ndevice, or instrument which, when used offensively against a person,\\n\\nis likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury.” OCGA §\\n\\n16-5-21 (a) (2).\\n\\n       OCGA § 16-2-20 (a) provides that “[e]very person concerned\\n\\nin the commission of a crime is a party thereto and may be charged\\n\\nwith and convicted of commission of the crime.”          To obtain a\\n\\n                                  9\\n conviction of a person as a party to the crime, the State must prove\\n\\n“that he intentionally aided or abetted in the commission of the\\n\\ncrimes or intentionally advised, encouraged, counseled, or procured\\n\\nsomeone else to commit the crimes.” Frazier v. State, \\n308 Ga. 450\\n,\\n\\n453 (2) (a) (\\n841 SE2d 692\\n) (2020). “Conviction as a party to a crime\\n\\nrequires proof of a common criminal intent, which the jury may infer\\n\\nfrom the defendant’s presence, companionship, and conduct with\\n\\nanother perpetrator before, during, and after the crimes.” Rooks v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 743\\n, 751 (2) (\\n893 SE2d 899\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Thus, to prove Huber guilty of the charge of felony murder\\n\\npredicated on aggravated assault, it was not necessary for the State\\n\\nto prove that he personally hit, kicked, or shot Raburn so long as the\\n\\nState proved that Huber was a party to the crimes. See Scoggins v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 832\\n, 836-39 (1) (a)-(b) (\\n896 SE2d 476\\n) (2023) (even\\n\\nwhere evidence did not conclusively establish which of two\\n\\ndefendants shot victim or had a weapon, evidence of a common\\n\\ncriminal intent, including defendant’s presence, companionship, and\\n\\n                                 10\\n conduct before and after the fatal shooting supported conviction as\\n\\na party to the crime of murder).\\n\\n     Here, the evidence showed that Woodard-Brady texted Huber\\n\\nto come “beat [Raburn’s] a**” and that Huber then came to the\\n\\nhouse.   Huber also admitted at trial that Woodard-Brady had\\n\\nrequested Huber to come over and that she was crying, that Huber\\n\\ndrove Harper (whom Huber knew to always carry a gun) to the\\n\\nhouse, and that Huber and Harper both engaged in a physical fight\\n\\nwith Raburn once they arrived. Moreover, Huber admitted that he\\n\\naided Harper during Harper’s fight with Raburn. And after Harper\\n\\nshot and killed Raburn, Huber drove Harper away and never called\\n\\n911. Huber’s clothes were also covered with Raburn’s blood despite\\n\\nHuber’s claim that he was not near Raburn when Harper shot him.\\n\\nThus, the evidence supported Huber’s presence and active\\n\\nparticipation before, during, and after the crimes.\\n\\n     We conclude that this evidence, when viewed in the light most\\n\\nfavorable to the jury’s verdict, was sufficient as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process to support Huber’s conviction for felony\\n\\n                                   11\\n murder predicated on aggravated assault, at least as a party to the\\n\\ncrimes. See, e.g., Harris v. State, \\n312 Ga. 602\\n, 604-05 (2) (\\n864 SE2d\\n\\n31\\n) (2021) (“even if someone else fired the fatal shot, it is clear that\\n\\n[a]ppellant and that individual joined in the attack on the victim,”\\n\\nand the jury was authorized to conclude that appellant was at least\\n\\na party to the crime of felony murder predicated on aggravated\\n\\nassault (citation and punctuation omitted)); Griffin v. State, \\n292 Ga.\\n\\n321\\n, 322 (1) (\\n737 SE2d 682\\n) (2013) (“Although [appellant] argues his\\n\\nadmission that he hit [victim] was insufficient to convict him of\\n\\nfelony murder based on an aggravated assault, there was evidence\\n\\nfrom which the jury was authorized to determine that he either\\n\\ndirectly participated in or was a party to a crime of aggravated\\n\\nassault which caused the death of another.”); Ellis v. State, \\n292 Ga.\\n\\n276\\n, 279 (1) (\\n736 SE2d 412\\n) (2013) (evidence was sufficient to\\n\\nsupport appellant’s conviction as a party to the crime of felony\\n\\nmurder predicated on aggravated assault where “[e]ven if\\n\\n[appellant] did not have the specific intent that [victim] be killed,\\n\\nthe crimes which he did intend were dangerous ones; by their\\n\\n                                  12\\n attendant circumstances, they created a foreseeable risk of death.”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)). Accordingly, this enumeration\\n\\nof error fails.\\n\\n      2.    Huber also contends that his trial counsel rendered\\n\\nineffective assistance (a) by failing to request an instruction that in\\n\\nassessing witness credibility, the jury was authorized to consider\\n\\nnegotiated pleas, leniency, or similar matters, or to request an\\n\\ninstruction on impeachment concerning a witness’s bias or motive;\\n\\nand (b) by failing, on his cross-examination of Woodard-Brady, to\\n\\nadduce evidence about the sentence she received in exchange for her\\n\\nguilty plea to voluntary manslaughter, the maximum sentence she\\n\\navoided, and the dismissal of the other counts against her. These\\n\\nclaims fail.\\n\\n      To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\\n\\nHuber must show both that his counsel’s performance was deficient\\n\\nand that such deficiency prejudiced his defense. See Strickland v.\\n\\nWashington, \\n466 U.S. 668\\n, 687 (III) (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674)\\n\\n(1984). To satisfy the deficiency prong, Huber must demonstrate\\n\\n                                  13\\n that his counsel “performed at trial in an objectively unreasonable\\n\\nway considering all the circumstances and in the light of prevailing\\n\\nprofessional norms.” Bacon v. State, \\n316 Ga. 234\\n, 239 (3) (\\n887 SE2d\\n\\n263\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). In doing so, Huber\\n\\nmust overcome “[a] strong presumption . . . that trial counsel’s\\n\\nperformance was reasonable and that counsel’s decisions and\\n\\nchoices at trial fell within the broad range of professional conduct as\\n\\nassessed from counsel’s perspective at the time of trial and under\\n\\nthe specific circumstances of the case.” \\nId.\\n (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). To establish prejudice, Huber “must prove that there is a\\n\\nreasonable probability that, but for his trial counsel’s deficiency, the\\n\\nresult of the trial would have been different.” Bates v. State, \\n313 Ga.\\n\\n57\\n, 62 (2) (\\n867 SE2d 140\\n) (2022). And if Huber fails to make a\\n\\nsufficient showing on either the deficiency or the prejudice prong,\\n\\nwe need not address the other prong. See Washington v. State, \\n313\\n\\nGa. 771\\n, 773 (3) (\\n873 SE2d 132\\n) (2022).\\n\\n     (a)   Failure to Request Jury Instructions. Huber argues that\\n\\nhis trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request\\n\\n                                  14\\n the pattern jury instruction: “In assessing the credibility of a\\n\\nwitness, you may consider any possible motive in testifying, if\\n\\nshown. In that regard, you are authorized to consider any possible\\n\\npending prosecutions, negotiations pleas, grants of immunity or\\n\\nlenience, or similar matters.”      Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury\\n\\nInstructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases § 1.31.80. Separately, Huber\\n\\nargues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by\\n\\nfailing to request a jury charge on impeachment concerning a\\n\\nwitness’s bias or motive.\\n\\n        But the trial court gave the suggested pattern jury instructions\\n\\non credibility of witnesses; witness, attacked; witness, impeached;\\n\\nprior     statements;   single   witness;   accomplice   corroboration;\\n\\npresumption of innocence; the State’s burden of proof; mere\\n\\npresence; and grave suspicion—including that in deciding witness\\n\\ncredibility, “you may consider all of the facts and circumstances of\\n\\nthe case, including the witnesses’ manner of testifying, their means\\n\\nand opportunity of knowing the facts about which they testify, the\\n\\nnature of the facts about which they testify, the probability or\\n\\n                                    15\\n improbability of a testimony, their interest or lack of interest in the\\n\\noutcome of the case, and their personal creditability [sic] as you\\n\\nobserve it.”    See Suggested Pattern Jury Instruction, Vol. II:\\n\\nCriminal Cases § 1.31.10.        Because we have held that these\\n\\ninstructions adequately covered the concept set out in Pattern\\n\\nInstruction § 1.31.80, the failure to request that charge is not\\n\\ndeficient. See Perkins v. State, \\n313 Ga. 885\\n, 902 (5) (a) (\\n873 SE2d\\n\\n185\\n) (2022) (“[T]he trial court adequately covered [Pattern\\n\\nInstruction § 1.31.80] in the instructions it gave the jury on witness\\n\\ncredibility and impeachment.”). Similarly, we have held that the\\n\\ninstructions given by the trial court sufficiently covered the concept\\n\\nof impeachment by showing bias or motive. See Lee v. State, \\n281 Ga.\\n\\n776\\n, 777-78 (3) (\\n642 SE2d 835\\n) (2007) (trial court’s instruction that\\n\\nthe jury is “the arbiter of each witness’s credibility and that it should\\n\\ngive consideration to each witness’s interest or lack thereof in the\\n\\noutcome of the case . . . adequately covered the possible motive,\\n\\ninterest, or bias of the State’s witnesses,” and therefore “trial\\n\\ncounsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to request\\n\\n                                   16\\n additional instruction”).\\n\\n     Huber argues on appeal that Lee and its progeny should be\\n\\noverruled.     But this argument does not support his ineffective\\n\\nassistance claim since “there is no general duty on the part of\\n\\ndefense counsel to anticipate changes in the law.” Williams v.\\n\\nRudolph, \\n298 Ga. 86\\n, 89 (\\n777 SE2d 472\\n) (2015) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). Accordingly, Huber has not shown that his\\n\\ncounsel was deficient in this respect, and this claim fails.\\n\\n     (b)     Cross-Examination    of    Woodard-Brady.         Huber\\n\\nacknowledges that the jury heard evidence that Woodard-Brady\\n\\npleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter but argues that his trial\\n\\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing, on his cross-\\n\\nexamination of Woodard-Brady, to adduce evidence about the\\n\\nsentence she received in exchange for her guilty plea, the maximum\\n\\nsentence she avoided for murder and three counts of aggravated\\n\\nassault, and the dismissal of those counts, which Huber contends\\n\\nwas relevant to Woodard-Brady’s bias and motive to testify against\\n\\nHuber.\\n\\n                                  17\\n      Pretermitting whether counsel was deficient in failing to elicit\\n\\nthe penalties that Woodard-Brady faced before pleading guilty, we\\n\\nconclude that Huber has not met his burden of demonstrating that\\n\\nhe was prejudiced by the alleged deficiency. The evidence against\\n\\nHuber was strong. Huber admitted at trial that he went over to\\n\\nWoodard-Brady’s house on the day of the murder, that Huber and\\n\\nHarper together fought Raburn, that Harper asked Huber to help\\n\\nhim pull Raburn off him during the fight, and that subsequently\\n\\nHarper shot Raburn. Even though Huber claimed to have walked\\n\\naway and been by his car at the time of the shooting, Raburn’s blood\\n\\nwas found on Huber’s clothes. In contrast, although Woodard-Brady\\n\\nclaimed that she asked Huber to come over to beat Raburn, she also\\n\\ntestified that she did not witness the fight or the shooting.\\n\\n     Also,   counsel   attempted       to   impeach   Woodard-Brady’s\\n\\ncredibility. As recognized by the trial court, the jury heard that\\n\\nWoodard-Brady pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in\\n\\nconnection with her role in the shooting. Moreover, Woodard-Brady\\n\\nacknowledged on direct examination that she “lied by omission,” and\\n\\n                                  18\\n Huber’s trial counsel further cross-examined her on that point by\\n\\nhaving her admit on the stand that her “story changed each time”\\n\\nshe talked to the police.     Given the foregoing, Huber has not\\n\\nestablished a reasonable probability that but for counsel’s failure to\\n\\nfurther impeach Woodard-Brady by eliciting information about the\\n\\npenalties that Woodard-Brady avoided by pleading guilty, the result\\n\\nof his trial would have been different. See, e.g., Benton v. Hines, \\n306\\n\\nGa. 722\\n, 725 (2) (\\n832 SE2d 801\\n) (2019) (counsel’s failure to elicit\\n\\nevidence of witness’s maximum possible sentence did not prejudice\\n\\ndefendant where jury heard other details of witness’s plea deal, and\\n\\nwitness’s testimony was corroborated by other evidence, including\\n\\ndefendant’s own incriminating statement); McCoy v. State, \\n303 Ga.\\n\\n141\\n, 143 (2) (\\n810 SE2d 487\\n) (2018) (“In light of the strong evidence\\n\\nof guilt, there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the\\n\\ntrial would have been different had trial counsel utilized alternative\\n\\nimpeachment evidence.”). This claim therefore fails.\\n\\n     3.   Conceding that his trial counsel did not object to the trial\\n\\ncourt’s jury instructions on simple assault (as an element of\\n\\n                                  19\\n aggravated assault) and voluntary manslaughter, Huber contends\\n\\nthat the trial court plainly erred in its instructions to the jury on\\n\\nthese legal principles. See OCGA § 17-8-58 (b) (“Failure to object in\\n\\naccordance with subsection (a) of this Code section shall preclude\\n\\nappellate review of such portion of the jury charge, unless such\\n\\nportion of the jury charge constitutes plain error which affects\\n\\nsubstantial rights of the parties. Such plain error may be considered\\n\\non appeal even if it was not brought to the court’s attention as\\n\\nprovided in subsection (a) of this Code section.”). Huber’s claims fail.\\n\\n     To show plain error, Huber “must demonstrate that the\\n\\ninstructional error was not affirmatively waived, was obvious\\n\\nbeyond reasonable dispute, likely affected the outcome of the\\n\\nproceedings, and seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public\\n\\nreputation of judicial proceedings. Satisfying all four prongs of this\\n\\nstandard is difficult, as it should be.” Rice v. State, \\n311 Ga. 620\\n, 623\\n\\n(1) (\\n857 SE2d 230\\n) (2021) (citation and punctuation omitted). And\\n\\nthis Court does not have to analyze all elements of the plain-error\\n\\ntest where an appellant fails to establish any one of them. See Lewis\\n\\n                                  20\\n v. State, \\n311 Ga. 650\\n, 665 (4) (\\n859 SE2d 1\\n) (2021).\\n\\n     (a)   Simple assault. As part of its instruction on aggravated\\n\\nassault, the trial court instructed the jury on simple assault, stating:\\n\\n“To prove assault, the State does not have to prove that the other\\n\\nperson was actually injured. However, the State must prove that\\n\\nthe defendant attempted to cause a violent injury to the person\\n\\nand/or committed an act that placed the person in reasonable\\n\\napprehension or fear of immediately receiving a violent injury.”\\n\\nAlthough not entirely clear, Huber seems to argue that based on the\\n\\nallegations of the indictment, the trial court should have only\\n\\ninstructed the jury on simple assault under OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (1),\\n\\nwhich provides that a person commits the offense of simple assault\\n\\nwhen he “[a]ttempts to commit a violent injury to the person of\\n\\nanother,” such that the trial court’s additional charge defining an\\n\\nassault as an action that places “the person in reasonable\\n\\napprehension or fear of immediately receiving a violent injury”\\n\\nmisstated the law.\\n\\n      However, Huber was charged with aggravated assault by\\n\\n                                  21\\n attempting to commit a violent injury in Counts 3 and 4 and with\\n\\naggravated assault by committing an act which places another in\\n\\nreasonable apprehension of receiving a violent injury in Count 5,3\\n\\nso the trial court properly gave the suggested pattern jury\\n\\ninstructions concerning assault based on the allegations and\\n\\nevidence presented in the case. See OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (“A person\\n\\ncommits the offense of simple assault when he or she either: (1)\\n\\nAttempts to commit a violent injury to the person of another; or (2)\\n\\nCommits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of\\n\\nimmediately receiving a violent injury.”); Georgia Suggested Pattern\\n\\nJury Instruction, Vol. II: Criminal Cases § 2.20.21 (“For aggravated\\n\\nassault, the State must prove that the Defendant: 1. assaulted\\n\\n\\n     3 Regarding the aggravated assault counts of Huber’s indictment, Count\\n\\n3 charged him with “mak[ing] an assault upon the person of Daniel Hugh\\nRaburn with a firearm, a deadly weapon in the manner used, by intentionally\\nshooting said victim in an attempt to commit a violent injury upon said\\nperson”; Count 4 charged Huber with “mak[ing] an assault upon the person of\\nDaniel Hugh Raburn with the hands and feet of said accused, deadly weapons\\nin the manner used, by intentionally striking said victim in an attempt to\\ncommit a violent injury upon said person”; and Count 5 charged Huber with\\n“mak[ing] an assault upon the person of Daniel Hugh Raburn with the hands\\nand feet of said accused, deadly weapons in the manner used, by placing the\\nsaid victim in reasonable apprehension of receiving a violent injury by\\nintentionally striking said victim.”\\n                                    22\\n another person 2. (with a deadly weapon) (with an offensive\\n\\nweapon). To prove assault, the State does not have to prove that the\\n\\nother person was actually injured. However, the State must prove\\n\\nthat the Defendant (attempted to cause a violent injury to the\\n\\nperson) (committed an act that placed the person in reasonable\\n\\napprehension or fear of immediately receiving a violent injury).”).\\n\\nThere was no error, plain or otherwise, and Huber’s argument fails.\\n\\n     (b)   Voluntary manslaughter.       Huber argues that the jury\\n\\ncharge on voluntary manslaughter was plain error because by\\n\\nreferring only to “the defendant,” the trial court failed to also\\n\\ninstruct the jury that Harper could have been provoked by Raburn’s\\n\\nwords to a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion and if Harper\\n\\nwas so provoked, Huber would have been also because Huber had\\n\\nbeen charged as a party to the crimes.\\n\\n     However, not only did the trial court instruct the jury on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter at Huber’s request, it gave the charge\\n\\nrequested by Huber—which was the suggested pattern jury\\n\\ninstruction and which referred to “the defendant,” rather than\\n\\n                                23\\n “Harper”—verbatim.         See Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury\\n\\nInstruction, Vol. II: Criminal Cases §§ 2.10.40-42. And when an\\n\\nappellant has invited an alleged error, it constitutes an affirmative\\n\\nwaiver under plain-error review, thus providing no basis for\\n\\nreversal. Shank v. State, \\n290 Ga. 844\\n, 845 (2) (\\n725 SE2d 246\\n) (2012);\\n\\nsee also Vasquez v. State, \\n306 Ga. 216\\n, 229 (2) (c) (\\n830 SE2d 143\\n)\\n\\n(2019) (“An affirmative waiver may occur, for example, when a\\n\\ndefendant . . . explicitly requests a jury instruction that he later\\n\\nargues on appeal should not have been given.”); Shaw v. State, \\n292\\n\\nGa. 871\\n, 873 (2) n.3 (\\n742 SE2d 707\\n) (2013) (under plain error review,\\n\\n“reversal is not warranted if the error was invited by the appellant”).\\n\\nHuber’s claim therefore fails at the first prong of the plain error test.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

Baker, Attorney General, Mary Beth Westmoreland, Deputy Attorney General, Paula K. Smith, Senior Assistant Attorney General, Ruth Mary Bebko, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.\\nTHOMPSON, Justice.\\nWe granted Anthony Roland\\'s application for certificate of probable cause to appeal from the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Because we conclude that Roland was properly resentenced following revocation of his first offender probation and adjudication of guilt, we affirm.\\n*290 1. Roland entered a plea of guilty to the offense of child molestation in September 1993 and was sentenced under OCGA § 42-8-60(a)(1) of the First Offender Act, to five years to be served on probation, along with fines and several special conditions of probation. The sentencing order specified that \"upon violation of the terms of probation, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed to sentence defendant to the maximum sentence provided by law.\" Roland acknowledged that he had been advised of the maximum punishment provided by law for the offense to which he was pleading guilty.[1] The sentencing form also provided that if probation is revoked, \"the court may order execution of the sentence which is originally imposed or any portion thereof in a manner provided by law after deduction therefrom the amount of time the defendant has served on probation.\"\\nIn August 1996, the State petitioned for an adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence based upon evidence that Roland had violated two conditions of probation. Roland admitted the violations, waived a revocation hearing, and was adjudicated guilty of child molestation.[2] He was resentenced to a term of ten years\\x97five years to serve in prison, with the remaining five years to be served on probation. The resentencing order specified that Roland be incarcerated for a term of five years \"over and above any time served on probation.\"\\nRoland sought habeas corpus relief on several grounds, including a claim that the ten-year sentence failed to include credit for the three years he had served on probation. The habeas court ruled that there was no error in the revocation sentencing since the new sentence (ten years), when added to the time served on probation (three years), was within the statutory range for the underlying crime (twenty years).\\nWe inquired:\\nWhether, when the probation of a first offender is revoked, the sentencing court must give the defendant credit for time served on probation when imposing sentence pursuant to conviction, and under what circumstances may language in the first-offender sentence alter that rule. See OCGA § 42-8-38(c); OCGA § 42-8-60(b); Stephens v. State, 245 Ga. 835, 268 S.E.2d 330 (1980); McKinney v. State, 240 Ga. App. 812(3), 525 S.E.2d 395 (1999).\\nThis case involves several principles of law affecting probationers sentenced under the First Offender Act. When a first offender probationer violates the terms of his probation and the trial court enters an adjudication of guilt, the court may impose any sentence permitted by law for the offense the probationer has been found guilty of committing. OCGA § 42-8-60(b); Beasley v. State, 165 Ga.App. 160, 299 S.E.2d 886 (1983). In addition, this Court has determined that OCGA § 42-8-38(c) applies to first offender probation, insofar as time spent on probation prior to an adjudication of guilt must be credited to any new sentence received. Stephens v. State, supra. Accord McKinney v. State, supra at 812(3), 525 S.E.2d 395. However, before an enhanced sentence may be imposed, the accused must be informed of that eventuality at the time the first offender probation sentence is pronounced. Stephens, supra. He must also be informed in the sentencing order that he will receive credit for time served on probation against any new sentence. Id.\\nAt Roland\\'s first offender sentencing hearing, the court admonished him both verbally, as well as in the sentencing order, that he was subject to the maximum punishment allowable by law for the offense of child molestation should his probation be revoked and guilt adjudicated; and Roland acknowledged his understanding of that possible consequence. Compare Stephens, supra. The sentencing order also specified that under *291 such circumstances, he would be entitled to receive credit for time served on probation.\\nAt the resentencing hearing, there was considerable discussion among the court, counsel, and a representative from the probation department as to the effect on his new sentence of the three years Roland had served on probation. The court clearly recognized that in imposing a new sentence, it was required to give Roland credit for those three years. The resulting order specifies a sentence of \"ten years, five years over and above any time previously served.\" While the order could mean that Roland has not been credited for the period served on probation, it can also be read to incorporate that time. Because the sentencing language is unclear and subject to misinterpretation, we disapprove its use in this context. However, in this case we have the benefit of a lengthy discussion on the record which reveals that the sentencing court was well aware of its obligation to credit Roland for time served on probation and intended to do so. Therefore, we agree with the habeas court\\'s interpretation of the resentencing order\\x97that Roland is required to serve a total of thirteen years\\x97five to be served in prison beyond the three already served on probation, to be followed by an additional five years on probation. Because Roland was resentenced within the maximum sentence allowable by law, he was clearly advised of this possibility, and the court credited the time already served on probation, we find no error. Compare McKinney v. State, supra at 812(3), 525 S.E.2d 395 (where it cannot be ascertained from the record whether first offender whose guilt is adjudicated received credit for time served on probation, case must be remanded for such a determination); Franklin v. State, 236 Ga.App. 401(1), 512 S.E.2d 304 (1999) (following adjudication of guilt of first offender probationer, imposition of statutory maximum sentence without credit for time served on probation is unlawful); Couch v. State, 246 Ga.App. 106(1), 539 S.E.2d 609 (2000) (where no credit is given for time served, case must be remanded for resentencing).\\nWe take this opportunity to impress upon the bench and bar that before a first offender probationer may be resentenced to a sentence greater than that imposed at the entry of the plea, the accused must be so informed of that eventuality. Stephens, supra. In addition, upon revocation of probation and an adjudication of guilt, any new sentence imposed must credit the defendant with time served on probation. Id. This information must also be made known to the defendant at sentencing and included in the first offender sentencing form. In order to avoid confusion in this regard, the new sentencing order should specify that the defendant has received credit for time served on probation, which has been applied toward the new sentence.\\nWe also have concern with the first offender sentencing form insofar as it tracks the language of OCGA § 42-8-38(c), as follows: \"If such probation is revoked, the court may order the execution of the sentence which is originally imposed or any portion thereof in the manner provided by law.\" The foregoing provision is applicable to the State-wide Probation Act in general, OCGA § 42-8-20 et seq. However, OCGA § 42-8-60 et seq., is a separate statutory procedure which is available at the discretion of the sentencing court only for a \"defendant who has not been previously convicted of a felony.\" Id. Upon revocation and an adjudication of guilt, a probationer under OCGA § 42-8-60 may be sentenced to the maximum penalty allowable by law for the charged offense. Because the foregoing language is inapplicable to probationers under the First Offender Act, it should be eliminated from the form.\\n2. The habeas court correctly ruled that Roland was advised of the right to withdraw his negotiated plea upon the sentencing court\\'s decision not to follow the negotiated recommendation, and that the guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nAll the Justices concur.\\nNOTES\\n[1] A first offense of child molestation may be punishable by imprisonment for not less than five nor more than twenty years. OCGA § 16-6-4(b).\\n[2] A previous petition for adjudication of guilt was filed by the State alleging violations of the conditions of probation. Roland waived a hearing in that matter. The court determined that he had violated the terms of his probation and sentenced him to serve a period of 60 to 120 days in a state detention center, plus the remainder of his original sentence, including all previously imposed conditions of probation. He was permitted, however, to retain his first offender status at that time.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1328779/roland-v-meadows/'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In the Supreme Court of Georgia\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Decided: March 19, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n     S24Z0598. IN THE MATTER OF JOEL DAVID MYERS.\\n\\n     PER CURIAM.\\n\\n     This matter is before the Court on Joel David Myers’s\\n\\nApplication for Certification of Fitness to Practice Law pursuant to\\n\\nPart A, Section 10 of the Rules Governing Admission to the Practice\\n\\nof Law in Georgia (the “Rules”). Myers was originally admitted to\\n\\nthe Bar in 1998 and worked at various iterations of his own law firm\\n\\nfrom 1999-2009, with the most recent being Myers & Associates\\n\\nIntellectual Property Law. In the winter of 2014, Myers failed to\\n\\nrespond to the State Bar’s Notice of Investigation related to a client\\n\\ngrievance, and this Court suspended him from the practice of law in\\n\\nGeorgia “until further order of [the] Court.” See S15Y0474 (Dec. 1,\\n\\n2014). Then, in October 2015, this Court considered two separate\\n\\nNotices of Discipline, alleging that Myers had violated Rules 1.3, 1.4,\\n 1.5, 1.8, 1.15 (I), 1.15 (II), 1.16 (d), 3.2, 8.4 (a) (4), and 9.3 of the\\n\\nGeorgia Rules of Professional Conduct, see Bar Rule 4-102 (d), in his\\n\\ninteractions with two clients in unrelated matters. Because Myers\\n\\nfailed to timely reject the Notices of Discipline, he was found to be\\n\\nin default as to those matters and the alleged facts were deemed\\n\\nadmitted. See Bar Rule 4-208.1 (b). After consideration of the record,\\n\\nthis Court disbarred Myers. See In the Matter of Myers, \\n297 Ga. 783\\n\\n\\n(\\n778 SE2d 223\\n) (2015).\\n\\n     Asserting that his disbarment was the result of various\\n\\nsignificant stressors in his life, which led to a lengthy battle with\\n\\nuntreated depression, and stating that he has taken steps to work\\n\\nthrough that depression to the point that he is rehabilitated, Myers\\n\\nnow seeks readmission. Following review of his application and his\\n\\nappearance at an informal conference, the Board to Determine\\n\\nFitness of Bar Applicants (the “Fitness Board”) voted to recommend\\n\\ngranting Myers’s application. The application is now before this\\n\\nCourt for final adjudication. See Bar Admission Rules, Part A, § 10\\n\\n(e) (“[t]he Supreme Court shall make the final determination\\n\\n                                   2\\n regarding certification of fitness” of attorneys applying for\\n\\nreadmission to the practice of law).\\n\\n     In connection with his application for readmission, Myers filed\\n\\na statement of rehabilitation in accordance with In re Cason, \\n249\\n\\nGa. 806\\n (\\n294 SE2d 520\\n) (1982). He explained that, beginning in\\n\\n2009, he experienced several major upheavals in his life that led to\\n\\nan “undiagnosed severe depression” for five to six years. He\\n\\nadmitted that, as his depression and life worsened, he engaged in\\n\\nthe behavior which led to his disbarment, and that he “was not\\n\\nmentally capable of providing a thorough response” to the 2013 and\\n\\n2014 grievances filed against him. Myers expressed that he “feel[s]\\n\\nhorrible about [his] behavior that hurt so many and led to [his]\\n\\ndisbarment,” and he “take[s] full responsibility for [his] actions.”\\n\\nAccording to Myers, he started to overcome his depression in 2015\\n\\nby focusing on raising his son and rebuilding his life. After working\\n\\nvarious jobs to regain financial stability, Myers reached out to one\\n\\nof the clients involved in the case that led to his disbarment, offering\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   3\\n to pay the former client full restitution, but the client declined that\\n\\noffer.\\n\\n         Myers has also submitted letters of recommendation from his\\n\\ncurrent boss (and former law partner) and others who know him\\n\\nthrough his volunteer work, all of whom attest to Myers’s\\n\\nprofessionalism, high moral character, and his ongoing commitment\\n\\nto his work at their organizations. Notably, Myers’s former partner\\n\\ndescribes Myers as a “prompt, diligent, respectful, and skillful”\\n\\nworker and states his support for Myers’s readmission, noting that\\n\\n“[p]rior to [the] issues [that led to Myers’s disbarment], he was an\\n\\nexcellent, diligent, and caring attorney and law partner” and that\\n\\nMyers “is capable of regaining that status.”\\n\\n         As part of its investigation, the Fitness Board provided notice\\n\\nto the State Bar of Georgia and to the bar membership and chief\\n\\njudge of the Atlanta Judicial Circuit where Myers practiced,\\n\\nprovided newspaper notice to the public in the area where Myers\\n\\nhad practiced, and sought confirmation from the Client Security\\n\\nFund that no restitution was due. See Part A, § 10 (d) (1)-(4) of the\\n\\n                                     4\\n Bar Admission Rules. The Fitness Board received no response from\\n\\nmembers of the public or the judiciary, but the State Bar responded\\n\\nthat, although there were other grievances filed against Myers\\n\\nduring and after the proceedings resulting in his disbarment, the\\n\\nBar had abandoned those matters as moot and had no plans to\\n\\npursue them.1 Moreover, none of the matters before the Bar required\\n\\nMyers to make restitution to the Client Security Fund.\\n\\n     At a conference before the Fitness Board, Myers took full\\n\\nresponsibility for his actions and made no excuses for them. He\\n\\nexpressed remorse for his actions and described his path to recovery.\\n\\nAfter considering Myers’s testimony and written submissions, the\\n\\nFitness Board concluded that he had, by clear and convincing\\n\\nevidence, carried his burden of demonstrating rehabilitation and\\n\\nrecommended that he be readmitted to the Bar. See In re Cason, \\n249\\n\\nGa. at 808-809\\n (explaining that bar admission applicants bear the\\n\\nburden to establish rehabilitation by clear and convincing evidence,\\n\\n\\n\\n     1 The Bar did not specify the nature of the grievances that it dismissed\\n\\nas moot.\\n\\n                                     5\\n and “rehabilitation is the reestablishment of the reputation of a\\n\\nperson by his or her restoration to a useful and constructive place in\\n\\nsociety,” including “[t]he requirement of positive action”).\\n\\n     Upon consideration of the entire record, we defer to the Fitness\\n\\nBoard’s determination that Myers has shown that he is entitled to\\n\\nbe certified as fit to practice law in Georgia. Accordingly, as it\\n\\nappears that Myers has satisfied all of the requirements for approval\\n\\nof his application for certification of fitness, see Bar Admission\\n\\nRules, Part A, Section 10, this Court hereby grants Myers’s\\n\\napplication for certification of fitness and orders that, upon\\n\\nsatisfaction of all the requirements of Part B of the Rules, including\\n\\ntaking and passing the Georgia Bar Examination, Myers may be\\n\\nreadmitted as an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of\\n\\nGeorgia.\\n\\n     Certification of fitness for readmission granted.

HASSAN v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       ELLINGTON, Justice.\\n\\n       A Fulton County jury found Muhammad Hassan guilty of\\n\\nparticipation in street gang activity, murder, six counts of\\n\\naggravated assault, and firearms charges in connection with a drive-\\n\\nby shooting that resulted in the death of Amira Cameron.1 Hassan\\n\\n\\n       1 The shooting occurred on October 4, 2015. On March 18, 2016, a Fulton\\n\\nCounty grand jury returned an indictment charging Hassan and Jamaris\\nZinnerman with participation in criminal street gang activity through\\ncommission of the offenses of murder and aggravated assault with a deadly\\nweapon (Count 1); malice murder (Count 2); felony murder predicated on\\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Count 3); aggravated assault with\\na deadly weapon against Amira Cameron (Count 5); and possession of a\\nfirearm during the commission of a felony (Count 13). The grand jury also\\nindicted Hassan and Zinnerman with aggravated assault with a deadly\\nweapon against Myles Cameron (Count 6), Jeremecia Perry (Count 7), Jamario\\nCalloway (Count 8), Aquantis Hillman (Count 9), Dujuan Terry (Count 10),\\nTerrene Ja’Quan Perry (Count 11), and Josiah Wade (Count 12), and\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (Count 13). The grand\\njury indicted Hassan individually with possession of a firearm by a first\\noffender probationer (Count 14) and an additional count of felony murder of\\nAmira Cameron (Count 4) predicated on the weapons charge. Hassan and\\n contends that the trial court committed plain error by allowing\\n\\nhearsay evidence regarding a prior drive-by shooting. In addition,\\n\\nHassan contends that the trial court committed plain error in failing\\n\\nto instruct the jury about the State’s “heightened burden of proof\\n\\nunder OCGA § 24-14-6,” which requires the exclusion of every\\n\\nreasonable hypothesis other than guilt when the case against the\\n\\naccused rests entirely on circumstantial evidence. For the reasons\\n\\nexplained below, we affirm.\\n\\n      Pertinent to Hassan’s arguments on appeal, the evidence\\n\\npresented at trial showed the following. At approximately 8:20 p.m.\\n\\non October 4, 2015, a gold- or champagne-colored Chevrolet Malibu\\n\\nentered the parking lot of the Oakley Shoals Apartments in Fulton\\n\\n\\n\\nZinnerman were tried jointly in May 2019. The jury found Hassan guilty on\\nCounts 1 through 7, 9 through 11, 13, and 14; the State entered nolle prosequi\\non Counts 8 and 12. The jury also found Zinnerman guilty of Counts 1 through\\n3, 5 through 7, 9 through 11, and 13. On May 28, 2019, the trial court sentenced\\nHassan to serve life in prison plus 25 years in prison. The trial court\\ndetermined that Count 5 merged for purposes of sentencing. The trial court\\nalso declared that Counts 3 and 4 were vacated as a matter of law. Hassan filed\\na timely motion for a new trial, which he amended on July 15, 2021, June 1,\\n2022, and March 27, 2023. After a hearing on March 29, 2023, the trial court\\ndenied Hassan’s motion for a new trial on April 7, 2023. Hassan filed a timely\\nnotice of appeal, and the case was docketed in this Court to the term beginning\\nin December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                       2\\n County. Quin Vann, a resident of the complex, testified that she\\n\\nheard gunfire outside of her apartment that night. She ran out to\\n\\nsee what had happened and saw a champagne-colored Chevy Malibu\\n\\nwith all its windows down drive past and then exit the parking lot.\\n\\nVann called 911 to report the shooting at 8:21 p.m.\\n\\n     When the Malibu entered the parking lot, several teenagers\\n\\nwho were friends and acquaintances from around the neighborhood\\n\\nwere standing near the entrance. The group included Aquantis\\n\\nHillman, Amira Cameron, Myles Cameron, Ja’Quan Perry,\\n\\nJeremecia Perry, Dujuan Terry, and others. Five members of the\\n\\ngroup testified at Hassan’s trial.\\n\\n     Myles Cameron testified that there were four or five people in\\n\\nthe Malibu, all of whom appeared to be staring at his group through\\n\\nthe passenger-side windows as the car drove slowly by. Terry and\\n\\nHillman also testified that they saw four or five people in the car,\\n\\nand all of them had their heads turned in the group’s direction as\\n\\nthey drove by. Uneasy, the group of teens crossed to the other side\\n\\nof the street. Myles Cameron testified that Terry retrieved a “.38\\n\\n                                     3\\n revolver” from Perry’s bookbag and held it at his side, although\\n\\nTerry testified that he did not have a gun and Perry testified that\\n\\nshe did not have a bookbag or a gun with her that night. Myles\\n\\nCameron, Perry, and Hillman testified that the driver of the Malibu\\n\\nturned around at the far end of the parking lot, turned off the\\n\\nheadlights, and drove back towards the group. Hillman testified that\\n\\nthe Malibu’s windows were open and at least two occupants of the\\n\\ncar were holding guns out of the front and rear passenger-side\\n\\nwindows. The car’s occupants then started shooting in the teenagers’\\n\\ndirection. Myles Cameron’s 15-year-old sister, Amira Cameron,\\n\\nreceived a fatal gunshot wound to the right side of her head;\\n\\neveryone else in the group escaped injury.\\n\\n     At the time of the shooting, Jamaris Zinnerman, a member of\\n\\nthe Smash Krew Billy Gang (“SKBG”), was under court supervision\\n\\nand wore an ankle monitor that included a GPS transmitter.\\n\\nRecords from that transmitter showed that at 8:19 p.m. Zinnerman’s\\n\\nmonitor was at the entrance of the Oakley Shoals Apartments and\\n\\nthen was in the parking lot where the shooting occurred at 8:20 p.m.\\n\\n                                 4\\n The transmitter records showed that the monitor was on a nearby\\n\\nparkway leaving the scene at 8:22 p.m.; was at South Fulton\\n\\nHospital on Cleveland Avenue at 8:34 p.m.; left that hospital at 9:40\\n\\np.m.; and arrived at Atlanta Medical Center at 9:56 p.m.\\n\\n     Hassan testified that he drove his mother’s Malibu to the\\n\\nOakley Shoals Apartments on the night of the shooting and that\\n\\nZinnerman rode in the rear passenger seat. Hassan testified that\\n\\nthree “acquaintances,” who had been at a party that he had attended\\n\\nthat night and had asked him for a ride home, were also in the car;\\n\\none passenger asked to be dropped off at the Oakley Shoals\\n\\nApartments. Hassan testified that before beginning the drive, he\\n\\nasked his passengers whether anyone was carrying a gun, because\\n\\n“[b]efore [he] even let anybody in [his] car [he would] make sure”\\n\\nthey did not have a gun. Hassan admitted that he passed a group of\\n\\npeople who were standing right in front of the entrance to the\\n\\ncomplex and testified that they were “looking crazy” at the\\n\\noccupants of the car and some seemed to be “clutching,” which he\\n\\ndefined as reaching for weapons. Hassan testified that, based on\\n\\n                                 5\\n that behavior, he decided not to stop to drop off his passenger and\\n\\ninstead turned around, and again passed the group, which had\\n\\ncrossed the street. Then, Hassan heard gunshots and sped away. He\\n\\ntestified that he was certain that no one was shooting out of his car.\\n\\nIn particular, Hassan testified that he did not have a gun that night\\n\\nand that he did not shoot anyone. He testified that, after they left\\n\\nthe Oakley Shoals Apartments, Zinnerman told him he had been\\n\\nshot. Hassan saw that Zinnerman was bleeding. Hassan drove to the\\n\\nnearest hospital and carried Zinnerman inside. Hassan denied being\\n\\na gang member at the time of trial but admitted he had previously\\n\\nbeen in a Bloods gang, the Nine Trey Bloods, from age 14 until some\\n\\nunspecified point in 2015. Hassan testified that Zinnerman had been\\n\\nin the Nine Trey Bloods gang and had tattoos that represented the\\n\\nNine Trey Bloods. Hassan testified that SKBG is not part of the\\n\\nBloods.\\n\\n     A .38-caliber bullet was removed from Amira Cameron’s brain,\\n\\nand a .38-caliber bullet was removed from Zinnerman’s body during\\n\\nsurgery. Another .38-caliber bullet was found in the Malibu. An\\n\\n                                  6\\n expert firearms and tool mark examiner testified that the bullet\\n\\nfound in the Malibu and the bullet removed from Zinnerman’s body\\n\\nwere fired by the same gun, but the bullet that fatally wounded\\n\\nAmira Cameron was fired by a different gun. DNA testing of blood\\n\\nthat had soaked into the Malibu’s rear seat cushion matched\\n\\nZinnerman’s DNA profile.\\n\\n     In addition to Hillman’s testimony about the October 4, 2015\\n\\nshooting, Hillman testified that he was a member of the Crips gang,\\n\\na rival of the Bloods gang, and that a person being a “Billy” means\\n\\nhe is a Blood. Hillman testified that, days before the shooting at the\\n\\nOakley Shoals Apartments, members of the Billy Bloods yelled an\\n\\ninsult that referred to the rivalry between the Bloods and the Crips\\n\\nand then shot at him. Hillman testified that, in gang culture, one\\n\\nmember’s having a problem with someone means that the entire\\n\\ngang has a problem with that person, regardless of whether the\\n\\nother members know that person.\\n\\n     An assistant district attorney testified as a criminal street\\n\\ngang expert about the Bloods criminal gang, which has west-coast-\\n\\n                                  7\\n affiliated and east-coast-affiliated subsets, and explained that the\\n\\nSmash Krew Billy Gang is a branch of the Nine Trey Billy Bad-ass\\n\\nBloods, one of the east-coast-affiliated Bloods groups that are\\n\\npredominant in Georgia. The assistant district attorney testified\\n\\nthat there is a rivalry and widespread hostility between Bloods\\n\\ngangs and Crips gangs. In particular, at the time of the shooting at\\n\\nthe Oakley Shoals Apartments there was hostility locally between\\n\\nthe Crips and SKBG members, who blamed the Crips for the\\n\\nunsolved drive-by shooting death of SKBG member Carlton Ramey\\n\\nearlier in 2015. The assistant district attorney testified that, “even\\n\\nto this day,” at the time of Hassan’s trial in May 2019, “members of\\n\\nthe Smash Krew Billy Gang post[ ] pictures of Carlton Ramey or [his\\n\\nnickname] ‘Cash’ [on social media] as an homage to him because he\\n\\nwas killed.” The assistant district attorney testified that, around the\\n\\ntime of the shooting at the Oakley Shoals Apartments, Zinnerman\\n\\nidentified himself as a member of SKBG through photos and\\n\\ncaptions he posted on social media. A detective testified that Hassan\\n\\nhas a five-pointed star tattooed on the right side of his face, which is\\n\\n                                   8\\n a common marker of the Bloods, and he had a red bandana in his\\n\\npocket when he was arrested, which members of the Bloods\\n\\ncommonly wear or carry as “a flag of identification” with the gang.\\n\\nThe detective testified that Hillman, a self-identified Crips gang\\n\\nmember, was a person of interest in Ramey’s death.\\n\\n     In closing argument, the State did not argue that there was\\n\\nany evidence that Hassan fired a weapon that night. The State\\n\\nargued that Hassan was guilty of the murder and the aggravated\\n\\nassaults either as a party to the crime of the actual shooters, by\\n\\nbeing the driver in the drive-by shooting, or as having participated\\n\\nin a conspiracy to commit the crimes.\\n\\n     1. Hassan contends that all of the evidence about Ramey’s\\n\\nmurder constituted inadmissible hearsay and that the superior\\n\\ncourt plainly erred by allowing the evidence. Hassan argues that the\\n\\nState’s proposed nexus between his alleged participation in a gang\\n\\nand the offenses arising out of the drive-by shooting at the Oakley\\n\\nShoals Apartments was that the occupants of his car shot at the\\n\\ngroup that included Hillman because they blamed Hillman’s gang,\\n\\n                                 9\\n the Crips, for the murder of Ramey, a fellow member of the shooters’\\n\\ngang, SKBG. See Overstreet v. State, \\n312 Ga. 565\\n, 574 (1) (b) (\\n864\\n\\nSE2d 14\\n) (2021) (To establish participation in criminal street gang\\n\\nactivity in violation of OCGA § 16-15-4, the State must show “some\\n\\nnexus” between the alleged predicate acts and an intent to further\\n\\nthe interests of the gang.). Hassan argues that the State “offered no\\n\\nfirst-hand witness to that other shooting” and that all of the State’s\\n\\nevidence about the Ramey murder was elicited during the testimony\\n\\nof the assistant district attorney, who testified as a gang expert, and\\n\\nthe detective. Hassan argues that neither witness “was a percipient\\n\\nwitness to the drive-by shooting [of Ramey] that they testified about.\\n\\nBoth learned about the incident through their investigations, which\\n\\ninevitably comprised the statements of others.” Hassan concedes\\n\\nthat he did not object to the evidence at trial on the basis that it\\n\\nconstituted inadmissible hearsay, but he argues that admitting the\\n\\nevidence constituted plain error.\\n\\n     A trial court’s ruling that admits evidence is ordinarily\\n\\nreviewable only where “a timely objection or motion to strike\\n\\n                                    10\\n appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the\\n\\nspecific ground was not apparent from the context[.]” OGGA § 24-1-\\n\\n103 (a) (1). See Middlebrooks v. State, \\n315 Ga. 671\\n, 687 (2) (a) (\\n884\\n\\nSE2d 318\\n) (2023). Without preservation of error as provided in\\n\\nOCGA § 24-1-103, an appellate court reviews an evidentiary ruling\\n\\nonly for plain error pursuant to OCGA § 24-1-103 (d), which provides\\n\\nthat “nothing in [that] Code section shall preclude a court from\\n\\ntaking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although\\n\\nsuch errors were not brought to the attention of the court.” See\\n\\nMiddlebrooks, 315 Ga. at 687 (2) (a).\\n\\n     To establish plain error, [the appellant] must point to an\\n     error that was not affirmatively waived, and that error\\n     must have been clear and not open to reasonable dispute,\\n     must have affected [the appellant’s] substantial rights,\\n     and must have seriously affected the fairness, integrity or\\n     public reputation of judicial proceedings.\\n\\nId. (citation and punctuation omitted). If the appellant fails to meet\\n\\none element of the plain error test, his claim fails. See Allen v. State,\\n\\n310 Ga. 411\\n, 416 (3) (\\n851 SE2d 541\\n) (2020). “Satisfying all four\\n\\nprongs of [the plain-error] standard is difficult, as it should be.”\\n\\n\\n                                   11\\n Williams v. State, \\n315 Ga. 490\\n, 495 (2) (\\n883 SE2d 733\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). In this case, Hassan failed to\\n\\nmeet the second prong, showing an error that was clear and not open\\n\\nto reasonable dispute, because it is not clear that the testimony he\\n\\nchallenges was hearsay.\\n\\n     “Hearsay is an out-of-court statement that a party offers into\\n\\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, and such\\n\\na statement generally is inadmissible at trial.” See OCGA §§ 24-8-\\n\\n801 (c); 24-8-802; see also Smith v. State, \\n309 Ga. 240\\n, 245 (2) (b)\\n\\n(\\n845 SE2d 598\\n) (2020). In his appellate brief, Hassan characterizes\\n\\nas inadmissible hearsay portions of the testimony of the assistant\\n\\ndistrict attorney in which the witness testified that he was “familiar\\n\\nwith” the Ramey murder, that Ramey had been a SKBG member,\\n\\nand that there were persons of interest in the investigation but not\\n\\nyet any indictment. As to the other witness, the detective, Hassan\\n\\ncharacterizes as inadmissible hearsay portions of the detective’s\\n\\ntestimony in which he testified that Ramey had been a SKBG\\n\\nmember, that Ramey was killed in a drive-by shooting prior to the\\n\\n                                 12\\n shooting at the Oakland Shoals Apartments, that Hillman identifies\\n\\nhimself as a member of the Crips, and that Hillman is a person of\\n\\ninterest in the Ramey murder investigation. The detective testified\\n\\nthat he “spoke with the detective that was working on [the Ramey\\n\\ncase] at the time,” but he did not testify about any statement made\\n\\nby that other detective or by any other person.\\n\\n     Neither witness expressly repeated the out-of-court statements\\n\\nof any other person. Although the detective testified that he was\\n\\n“familiar” with the Ramey investigation and referred to speaking\\n\\nwith another detective who worked on that investigation, the\\n\\ndetective did not specify what that other detective told him or how\\n\\nhe developed familiarity with the investigation. Given that, it was\\n\\nnot so obvious that the evidence was hearsay such that the trial\\n\\ncourt should have intervened sua sponte to exclude the testimony.\\n\\nBecause Hassan has not shown that allowing the testimony at issue\\n\\nwas a clear error that was not open to reasonable dispute, his claim\\n\\nof plain error fails. See Carter v. State, \\n317 Ga. 689\\n, 694 (2) (\\n895\\n\\nSE2d 295\\n) (2023); Stafford v. State, \\n312 Ga. 811\\n, 820 (3) (b) (865\\n\\n                                 13\\nSE2d 116\\n) (2021); Strother v. State, \\n305 Ga. 838\\n, 848 (4) (d) (\\n828\\n\\nSE2d 327\\n) (2019).\\n\\n     2. Hassan contends that the trial court erred in failing to\\n\\ninstruct the jury regarding the State’s “heightened burden of proof”\\n\\nunder OCGA § 24-14-6, which provides: “To warrant a conviction on\\n\\ncircumstantial evidence, the proved facts shall not only be consistent\\n\\nwith the hypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude every other reasonable\\n\\nhypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.” Again, Hassan\\n\\nconcedes that he did not object at trial to the instruction regarding\\n\\nconvictions based on circumstantial evidence but argues that the\\n\\ninstruction as given constituted plain error. See OCGA § 17-8-58 (b).\\n\\n     The plain error standard with regard to jury instructions, like\\n\\nthe standard regarding evidentiary rulings discussed in Division 1,\\n\\nsupra, has four requirements: an error that has not been\\n\\naffirmatively waived by the appellant, that is “clear or obvious,\\n\\nrather than subject to reasonable dispute,” that affected the\\n\\nappellant’s “substantial rights,” and that merits a remedy, in the\\n\\ndiscretion of the appellate court, on the basis that “the error\\n\\n                                 14\\n seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\\n\\njudicial proceedings.” Beard v. State, \\n317 Ga. 842\\n, 844 (2) (\\n893 SE2d\\n\\n893\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). “An error is plain if\\n\\nit is clear or obvious under current law. An error cannot be plain\\n\\nwhere there is no controlling authority on point.” Hill v. State, \\n310\\n\\nGa. 180\\n, 194 (11) (a) (\\n850 SE2d 110\\n) (2020) (citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). And the appellate court “need not analyze all\\n\\nof the elements of the plain error test when the appellant fails to\\n\\nestablish one of them.” \\nId.\\n\\n\\n     Regarding evidence, the trial court instructed the jury:\\n\\n          Now, your oath requires that you will decide this\\n     case based on the evidence. Evidence is the means by\\n     which any fact that is put in issue is established or\\n     disproved.\\n          Evidence includes all of the testimony of the\\n     witnesses, any exhibits admitted during the trial and\\n     stipulations of the attorneys; that is, any fact to which the\\n     attorneys have agreed with the approval by the Court.\\n          Evidence does not include the indictment, the plea\\n     of not guilty, the opening and closing remarks of the\\n     attorneys or questions asked by the attorneys. Evidence\\n     may be direct, circumstantial or both.\\n          In considering the evidence you may use reasoning\\n     and common sense to make deductions and reach\\n\\n\\n                                  15\\n      conclusions. You should not be concerned about whether\\n     the evidence is direct or circumstantial.\\n           Direct evidence is the testimony of a person who\\n     asserts that he or she has actual knowledge of a fact such\\n     as by personally observing or otherwise witnessing that\\n     fact.\\n           Circumstantial evidence is proof of a set of facts and\\n     circumstances that tend to prove or disprove another fact\\n     by inference; that is, by consistency with such fact or\\n     elimination of other facts. There’s no legal difference in\\n     the weight you may give to either direct or circumstantial\\n     evidence.\\n           You would be authorized to convict only if the\\n     evidence, whether direct or circumstantial or both,\\n     excludes all reasonable theories of innocence and proves\\n     the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n     In Hill, we considered a plain-error challenge to jury\\n\\ninstructions “regarding the level of proof required for conviction”\\n\\nand held that the appellant failed to show that giving the\\n\\ninstructions at issue constituted clear or obvious error where the\\n\\ninstructions at issue had been upheld by this Court and the\\n\\nappellant cited no controlling authority for the proposition that the\\n\\ninstructions were erroneous. See Hill, 310 Ga. at 194-195 (11) (a).\\n\\nThis Court has upheld a jury instruction that, like the evidence\\n\\ninstruction in this case, informed the jurors that they “would be\\n\\n\\n                                 16\\n authorized to convict only if the evidence, whether direct,\\n\\ncircumstantial, or both, excludes all reasonable theories of innocence\\n\\nand proves the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.”\\n\\nEubanks v. State, \\n317 Ga. 563\\n, 580 (3) (a) (\\n894 SE2d 27\\n) (2023). See\\n\\nGeorgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal\\n\\nCases (4th ed. 2007, updated Jan. 2023) § 1.30.20. Noting that,\\n\\n“[w]hen a requested jury instruction adds no essential point of law\\n\\nto the existing instructions, it is not error for the trial court to\\n\\ndecline to give it[,]” we held that the instructions at issue “effectively\\n\\nconveyed the point that the State was required to disprove\\n\\nreasonable hypotheses of [the appellant’s] innocence.” Eubanks, 317\\n\\nGa. at 580 (3) (a). Because the instructions at issue in this case have\\n\\nbeen upheld by this Court and Hassan has cited no controlling\\n\\nauthority for the proposition that the instructions were erroneous,\\n\\nHassan cannot show plain error. See id.; Hill, 310 Ga. at 194-195\\n\\n(11) (a).\\n\\n      We note that Hassan contends that this Court can consider the\\n\\nharmful effect of the alleged evidentiary error discussed in Division\\n\\n                                   17\\n 1 and the alleged instructional error discussed in Division 2 “in the\\n\\naggregate.” Because Hassan has not established clear error in either\\n\\ninstance, we do not reach the issue of whether failing to exclude sua\\n\\nsponte the alleged hearsay or failing to give a jury instruction in\\n\\nlanguage identical to OCGA § 24-14-6 affected Hassan’s substantial\\n\\nrights, either individually or in the aggregate.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

MARCELA RAMOS v.

On\\nJuly 19, 2023, the trial court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss and directed\\nthe entry of final judgment under OCGA § 9-11-54 (b). Ramos filed a motion for\\nreconsideration, which the trial court denied on September 7, 2023. On October 4,\\n2023, Ramos filed the instant appeal. We, however, lack jurisdiction because the\\nappeal is untimely.\\n      A notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of an appealable order.\\nOCGA § 5-6-38 (a).

App. 510\\n, 511 (\\n536 SE2d 187\\n) (2000), and the\\nfiling of such a motion does not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal. See\\nCheeley-Towns v. Rapid Group, \\n212 Ga. App. 183\\n, 183 (1) (\\n441 SE2d 452\\n) (1994). The\\nproper and timely filing of a notice of appeal is an absolute requirement to confer\\njurisdiction upon an appellate court. See Couch v.

TAYLER BROOKE CUNNINGHAM v. MATTHEW JORDAN\\n    MCDANIEL.\\n\\n      Tayler Brooke Cunningham (“the mother”) and Matthew Jordan McDaniel (the\\n“father”) are the parents of a minor child who was legitimated pursuant to a 2015\\nconsent order in which the trial court resolved issues of custody and child support.\\nIn 2019, the father filed a “Petition for Modification of Custody and Child Support\\nand Application for Citation of Contempt.” In March 2023, the trial court entered an\\norder which modified custody and child support and reserved the issue of attorney\\nfees. In July 2023, the trial court entered an award of attorney fees to the father under\\nOCGA § 19-9-3 (g). The mother filed this direct appeal of the July 2023 order. We,\\nhowever, lack jurisdiction.\\n      “Appeals from judgments or orders in divorce, alimony, and other domestic\\nrelations cases” must be initiated by filing an application for discretionary review.\\nOCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (2), (b). It is true that a direct appeal is proper under OCGA §\\n5-6-34 (a) (11) from all judgments or orders “in child custody cases” that award,\\nrefuse to change, or modify child custody, or orders that hold or decline to hold\\npersons in contempt of child custody orders. On appeal, the mother challenges only\\nthe trial court’s award of attorney fees to the father. Because neither custody nor\\ncontempt is an issue on appeal, this is not a “custody” case within the meaning of\\nOCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (11). See Voyles v. Voyles, \\n301 Ga. 44\\n, 45-47 (\\n799 SE2d 160\\n)\\n(2017) (explaining that appellate courts examine the issue raised on appeal to\\ndetermine whether a party is entitled to a direct appeal); Capehart v. Mitchell, \\n358\\nGa. App. 86\\n, 88 (2) (\\n851 SE2d 846\\n) (2020). Rather, it remains a domestic relations\\n case in which an application for discretionary appeal is required. See Davidson v.\\nCallaway, \\n274 Ga. 813\\n, 814 (\\n559 SE2d 728\\n) (2002) (“[I]n all domestic relations\\ncases, an appeal from an award of attorney fees must come to this Court via the\\ndiscretionary appeal procedures set forth in OCGA § 5-6-35.”).\\n       “Compliance with the discretionary appeals procedure is jurisdictional.”\\nSmoak v. Dept. of Human Resources, \\n221 Ga. App. 257\\n, 257 (\\n471 SE2d 60\\n) (1996).\\nThe mother’s failure to file a discretionary application deprives this Court of\\njurisdiction over this appeal, and it is accordingly DISMISSED.\\n\\n                                     Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\n                                         Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\\n                                                                    05/16/2024\\n                                             I certify that the above is a true extract from\\n                                     the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\n                                            Witness my signature and the seal of said court\\n                                     hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                    , Clerk.\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9502882/tayler-brooke-cunningham-v-matthew-jordan-mcdaniel/'}),\n",

DURDEN v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Devin Durden was convicted of felony murder and\\n\\nother crimes in relation to the shooting death of Dewayne\\n\\nChronister.1            On appeal, Durden argues that the trial court\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 Chronister died on October 17, 2016. On December 19, 2017, a\\nMuscogee County grand jury indicted Durden, along with Dontavis Screws and\\nJasmine Thomas, charging them with malice murder (Count 1), felony murder\\npredicated on armed robbery (Count 2), armed robbery (Count 3), and\\npossession of a firearm during commission of a felony (Count 4). Following\\nScrews’s guilty plea to the lesser offenses of voluntary manslaughter and\\nrobbery and Thomas’s guilty plea to the lesser offense of robbery, Durden was\\ntried from February 26 through March 1, 2019, and a jury found him not guilty\\nof malice murder but guilty of all the remaining counts. On April 2, 2019, the\\ntrial court sentenced Durden to life in prison for felony murder, a consecutive\\nsentence of ten years to serve for armed robbery, and a consecutive sentence of\\nfive years to serve for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.\\n       Durden filed a timely motion for new trial on April 12, 2019, which was\\namended on December 9, 2020. Following a hearing on January 6, 2022, the\\ntrial court denied Durden’s motion for new trial, as amended, on February 1,\\n2022. Durden filed a timely notice of appeal on February 17, 2022, and the\\ncase was docketed to the term of this Court beginning in December 2023 and\\nthereafter submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n committed plain error by (1) permitting a detective to provide\\n\\nextensive narrative testimony identifying Durden as the person\\n\\ndepicted in surveillance footage and (2) instructing the jury on\\n\\nsingle-witness testimony without also instructing it on accomplice\\n\\ncorroboration. Durden also argues that the cumulative harm caused\\n\\nby these alleged errors warrants reversal. For the reasons that\\n\\nfollow, we affirm in part and vacate in part.\\n\\n     Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, the\\n\\nevidence at trial showed that in the early-morning hours of October\\n\\n17, 2016, officers from the Columbus Police Department were called\\n\\nto the Parkwood mobile home park off Farr Road, where the body of\\n\\nChronister, a taxi driver, was found in the driver’s seat of his taxi.\\n\\nChronister died from a gunshot to the head; the bullet entered the\\n\\nleft side of his head and was recovered from his brain.          Law\\n\\nenforcement’s investigation—which included a review of the taxi\\n\\ncompany’s call logs showing the number that called for the taxi and\\n\\nwhere that caller requested to be picked up, a nearby gas station\\n\\nfrom which law enforcement was able to obtain and review\\n\\n                                  2\\n surveillance footage—led them to identify Durden, Screws, and\\n\\nThomas as suspects and arrest them for the crimes.\\n\\n     Co-indictees Screws and Thomas both testified on behalf of the\\n\\nState as part of their plea bargains. Thomas testified that around\\n\\n4:00 a.m. on the morning of October 17, 2016, Durden knocked on\\n\\nthe door of her home as she and Screws were asleep inside. She said\\n\\nthat Screws let Durden inside, and Durden asked Screws, “are you\\n\\ntrying to make some money?” After some more discussion, during\\n\\nwhich Thomas saw Durden handling a firearm, Thomas called a taxi\\n\\nfor Durden and Screws and told them to go to the nearby gas station,\\n\\nwhich was less than a five-minute walk away, to meet the taxi.2\\n\\nAfter she called the taxi for the men and they left, Thomas went\\n\\nback to sleep.    She testified that Durden and Screws returned\\n\\naround 7:00 a.m., and she heard them talking about how to divide\\n\\n“the money,” with Durden telling Screws that Screws was not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     2  Call logs from the taxi company showed that Thomas’s cell phone\\nnumber was used to call for a taxi in the early-morning hours of October 17\\nand that Thomas’s request for a taxi was the last pick-up Chronister made\\nbefore his death.\\n                                    3\\n getting half because “you did not do anything.” Thomas testified\\n\\nthat Durden then told them that he was “fixing to go drop the gun\\n\\noff because it was hot,” and he left. After Durden left, Screws told\\n\\nThomas that when their taxi arrived at Farr Road to drop them off,\\n\\nDurden “got out and had opened the cab driver’s door and said, it’s\\n\\na robbery and shot the man in the head.” Thomas identified Durden\\n\\nfrom a photo captured by the gas station’s surveillance camera,\\n\\ntestifying that she recognized Durden from the clothes he had worn\\n\\nto her home that night and from a speaker that hung from his belt\\n\\nand that there was not “any doubt in [her] mind” about who he was.\\n\\nShe also identified Durden and Screws from the surveillance video\\n\\nwhen it was played for her.\\n\\n     Screws testified that Durden came to Screws and Thomas’s\\n\\nhouse late at night on October 17 while he and Thomas were in bed.\\n\\nDurden and Screws began talking, and Durden “pulled out his gun\\n\\nand sat it on the counter,” and told Screws that he wanted to “[g]o\\n\\nhit a lick” to “get some money,” meaning he wanted to commit a\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 4\\n robbery.3 They decided to have Thomas call a taxi for them to rob.\\n\\nAccording to Screws, he and Durden then walked to the gas station,\\n\\nwhere they got in the taxi, and they had the driver take them to\\n\\nParkwood mobile home park on Farr Road, where Durden “held the\\n\\ngun on the man and then he shot the man and that’s when we took\\n\\noff running. He got the money and we took off running.” 4 Screws\\n\\ntestified that Durden took the victim’s wallet and cell phone, that\\n\\nDurden threw the cell phone in a ditch as they ran back to Screws’s\\n\\nhome, 5 and that after they arrived back at Screws’s home, they split\\n\\nthe money and Durden left. Screws also identified Durden from the\\n\\ngas station’s surveillance video, getting in the taxi with Screws and\\n\\nwearing the same shoes that law enforcement later recovered from\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 Screws recognized the gun to be a .380-caliber High Point.   When law\\nenforcement processed the crime scene, they recovered a .380-caliber shell\\ncasing on the ground near the taxi driver’s door, which a firearms expert\\nexamined and testified was “consistent with being fired from a high point .380\\nsemi-automatic pistol.”\\n      4 Surveillance footage from the Parkwood mobile home park showed a\\n\\ntaxi enter Parkwood at around 5:00 a.m.; about five minutes later, two men\\nare shown fleeing Parkwood on foot down Farr Road; the taxi was never shown\\nexiting the mobile home park.\\n      5 Law enforcement later recovered Chronister’s cell phone from the ditch\\n\\nwhere Screws told them Durden had thrown it.\\n                                      5\\n Durden, as well as from a still shot from that video, which Screws\\n\\ntestified showed a Bluetooth speaker that Durden wore hanging\\n\\nfrom his belt.\\n\\n     Columbus Police Detective Stuart Carter testified that he was\\n\\nthe lead investigator’s partner and assisted in the investigation by,\\n\\namong other things, obtaining and reviewing the surveillance\\n\\nfootage from the gas station, where Chronister’s taxi had been last\\n\\ndispatched.      As Detective Carter began discussing that footage\\n\\nduring his direct examination, he testified, “we believe this to be the\\n\\ndefendant that’s in the courtroom today and there are several factors\\n\\nthat we relied on.” Detective Carter went on by pointing out that\\n\\nthe individual depicted in the footage wore a particular “style of\\n\\nsweatpants”; a wristwatch “with a rather large face”; a Bluetooth\\n\\nspeaker hanging from his waist; and “most significant[ly],” a “very\\n\\ndistinctive” yellow, green, and grey pair of shoes, which Detective\\n\\nCarter determined from his investigatory research to be Nike\\n\\nPegasus 32 shoes.       These items ended up being “similar” or\\n\\n“identical” to clothing items and accessories, including a pair of Nike\\n\\n                                  6\\n Pegasus 32 shoes, recovered from the residence where Durden told\\n\\nDetective Carter he had been “staying” upon Durden’s arrest.6\\n\\nDetective Carter also explained that the individual in the\\n\\nsurveillance footage had a “distinctive” and “almost an identi[cal]\\n\\nhair style” to Durden’s at the time of his arrest. Detective Carter\\n\\nalso identified Durden from several still shots from the surveillance\\n\\nfootage based on “[t]he clothing that I pointed out, the shoes that we\\n\\nwould later recover, [and] the physical build of the individual.”\\n\\nAccording to Detective Carter, the footage showed Durden and\\n\\nScrews getting into Chronister’s taxi at the gas station at around\\n\\n5:00 a.m. Within minutes, Chronister was shot and killed at the\\n\\nnearby Parkwood mobile home park.\\n\\n      1.    Conceding      that    the       above-described    testimony     of\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 We note that Detective Carter testified regarding two portions of the\\n\\ngas station’s video surveillance footage from the night of the crimes: one from\\nearlier that night, and the other from the time the crimes were unfolding. In\\nthe footage from earlier that night, it is relatively easy to make out the facial\\nfeatures of the person whom Detective Carter identified as Durden, but in the\\nfootage from later that night when the individual (along with Screws)\\napproached and got into Chronister’s taxi, it is more difficult to make out the\\nidentity of the individual, who had his hood pulled up at that point.\\n\\n                                         7\\n Detective Carter was permitted “[w]ithout meaningful objection or\\n\\nadmonishment,” Durden contends that the trial court plainly erred\\n\\nin permitting Detective Carter to testify at length that Durden was\\n\\nthe person depicted in the surveillance video and still images, thus\\n\\nviolating the limitation on lay opinion imposed by OCGA § 24-7-701\\n\\n(a).\\n\\n       To establish plain error, Durden must meet each prong of a\\n\\nfour-prong test:\\n\\n       First, there must be an error or defect – some sort of\\n       deviation from a legal rule – that has not been\\n       intentionally    relinquished    or    abandoned,     i.e.,\\n       affirmatively waived, by the appellant. Second, the legal\\n       error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to\\n       reasonable dispute. Third, the error must have affected\\n       the appellant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary\\n       case means he must demonstrate that it affected the\\n       outcome of the trial court proceedings. Fourth and\\n       finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the\\n       appellate court has the discretion to remedy the error –\\n       discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error\\n       seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public\\n       reputation of judicial proceedings.\\n\\nWashington v. State, \\n312 Ga. 495\\n, 498 (1) (\\n863 SE2d 109\\n) (2021)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). “As we have noted, affirmatively\\n\\n\\n                                   8\\n establishing all four prongs is a difficult standard to satisfy.” \\nId. at\\n\\n498-99\\n (1) (citation and punctuation omitted). “This Court does not\\n\\nhave to analyze all elements of the plain-error test where an\\n\\nappellant fails to establish one of them.” Payne v. State, \\n314 Ga.\\n\\n322\\n, 325 (1) (\\n877 SE2d 202\\n) (2022).\\n\\n     Here, Durden hinges his argument on an alleged violation of\\n\\nOCGA § 24-7-701 (a), which provides:\\n\\n     (a)   If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the\\n           witness’s testimony in the form of opinion or\\n           inferences shall be limited to those opinions or\\n           inferences which are:\\n           (1) Rationally based on the perception of the\\n                witness;\\n           (2) Helpful to a clear understanding of the\\n                witness’s testimony or the determination of a\\n                fact in issue; and\\n           (3) Not based on scientific, technical, or other\\n                specialized knowledge within the scope of Code\\n                Section 24-7-702.\\n\\nWe have explained that “where there is ‘some basis for concluding\\n\\nthat a witness is more likely to correctly identify a defendant as the\\n\\nindividual depicted in surveillance [images], then lay opinion\\n\\ntestimony identifying a defendant in surveillance [images] is\\n\\n\\n                                   9\\n admissible under Rule 701.’” Glenn v. State, \\n306 Ga. 550\\n, 555 (3)\\n\\n(\\n832 SE2d 433\\n) (2019) (quoting Glenn v. State, \\n302 Ga. 276\\n, 280 (II)\\n\\n(\\n806 SE2d 564\\n) (2017) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     We start by noting that the vast majority of Detective Carter’s\\n\\nrelevant commentary on the surveillance footage was non-opinion,\\n\\nfactual testimony about the attire he personally observed worn by\\n\\nthe individual depicted therein and the attire he personally\\n\\nrecovered from Durden’s residence, and as such, that testimony is\\n\\nnot governed by Rule 701 (a)’s provisions regarding lay opinion\\n\\ntestimony. See Cooper v. State, \\n317 Ga. 676\\n, 685 (2) (\\n895 SE2d 285\\n)\\n\\n(2023). As for Detective Carter’s identification of Durden from the\\n\\nsurveillance footage, Durden argues that because Detective Carter\\n\\nwas not familiar with him on a personal level and had “no unique\\n\\nfirst-hand experience with Durden,” Detective Carter could not be\\n\\npermitted under Rule 701 (a) to opine that Durden was the\\n\\nindividual depicted therein and that the trial court thus clearly\\n\\nerred in permitting such testimony.\\n\\n     Assuming without deciding that the trial court clearly erred in\\n\\n                                10\\n permitting Detective Carter’s identification testimony, we conclude\\n\\nthat Durden has failed to show that the error affected the outcome\\n\\nof the proceedings because the identification testimony was\\n\\ncumulative of Thomas’s and Screws’s identification of him from the\\n\\nsame surveillance footage. Durden makes no argument that either\\n\\nThomas’s or Screw’s identification testimony was improper, and\\n\\nthey were more familiar with Durden than Detective Carter, making\\n\\ntheir identification testimony more compelling.       Thus, Durden\\n\\ncannot satisfy the third prong of the plain error test. See Grier v.\\n\\nState, \\n313 Ga. 236\\n, 245 (3) (f) (\\n869 SE2d 423\\n) (2022) (“Appellant has\\n\\nnot met his burden under the plain error standard to show a\\n\\nreasonable probability that the outcome would have been different,\\n\\nas the improperly admitted [testimony] was merely duplicative of\\n\\nother properly admitted evidence.”). Accordingly, this enumeration\\n\\nof error fails.\\n\\n      2.    Conceding that trial counsel neither requested an\\n\\naccomplice-corroboration charge nor objected to the trial court’s\\n\\nfailure to give such charge, Durden also contends that the trial court\\n\\n                                 11\\n plainly erred by failing to instruct the jury on accomplice\\n\\ncorroboration despite charging the jury that the testimony of a\\n\\nsingle witness is generally sufficient to establish a fact. See OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-14-8 (“The testimony of a single witness is generally sufficient\\n\\nto establish a fact. However, in certain cases, including . . . felony\\n\\ncases where the only witness is an accomplice, the testimony of a\\n\\nsingle witness shall not be sufficient. Nevertheless, corroborating\\n\\ncircumstances may dispense with the necessity for the testimony of\\n\\na second witness.”); OCGA § 17-8-58 (b) (“Failure to object in\\n\\naccordance with subsection (a) of this Code section shall preclude\\n\\nappellate review of such portion of the jury charge, unless such\\n\\nportion of the jury charge constitutes plain error which affects\\n\\nsubstantial rights of the parties. Such plain error may be considered\\n\\non appeal even if it was not brought to the court’s attention as\\n\\nprovided in subsection (a) of this Code section.”). Durden’s claim\\n\\nfails.\\n\\n         Here, the trial court committed clear and obvious error in\\n\\nfailing to give the accomplice-corroboration charge while giving the\\n\\n                                  12\\n single-witness charge since Durden’s co-indictees, Screws and\\n\\nThomas, testified at trial, see State v. Johnson, \\n305 Ga. 237\\n, 240 (1)\\n\\n(\\n824 SE2d 317\\n) (2019); Stanbury v. State, \\n299 Ga. 125\\n, 130-31 (2)\\n\\n(\\n786 SE2d 672\\n) (2016), and Durden did not affirmatively waive the\\n\\ninstructional error. But the record demonstrates that the error\\n\\nlikely did not affect the outcome of Durden’s trial, such that he has\\n\\nnot satisfied the third prong of the plain error test. See Rice v. State,\\n\\n311 Ga. 620\\n, 623 (1) (\\n857 SE2d 230\\n) (2021). Co-indictees Screws and\\n\\nThomas each testified regarding Durden’s involvement in the\\n\\ncrimes; their testimony “substantially corroborated each other’s\\n\\ntestimony”; and “it is well-settled that an accomplice’s testimony\\n\\nmay be corroborated by the testimony of another accomplice.”\\n\\nHurston v. State, \\n310 Ga. 818\\n, 830 (3) (c) (\\n854 SE2d 745\\n) (2021)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted); see also Payne, 314 Ga. at 327\\n\\n(1) (“[H]ad the jury been given an accomplice-corroboration\\n\\ninstruction, the testimony of any witness the jury concluded was an\\n\\naccomplice could have been corroborated by [ ] non-accomplice\\n\\nwitnesses or by the testimony of another accomplice.”). Moreover,\\n\\n                                   13\\n their testimony was also corroborated by other evidence, including\\n\\nthe gas station and mobile home park surveillance footage showing\\n\\nthat Durden and Screws rode in Chronister’s taxi from the store to\\n\\nthe crime scene; the recovery of a .380-caliber shell casing on the\\n\\nground near Chronister’s taxi door that was consistent with being\\n\\nfired from a High Point .380 pistol, corroborating Screws’s testimony\\n\\nas to the type of gun Durden possessed and where Durden stood\\n\\nwhen he shot Chronister; testimony and records from the taxi\\n\\nservice corroborating Screws’s and Thomas’s testimony that Thomas\\n\\ncalled for a taxi for Screws and Durden during the early-morning\\n\\nhours of October 17, 2016; and the recovery of the victim’s cell phone\\n\\nfrom the location where Screws told law enforcement that Durden\\n\\nhad thrown it. Had the charge been given, it is highly likely the jury\\n\\nwould have returned the same verdict. See Payne, 314 Ga. at 326-\\n\\n27 (1) (failure to give accomplice-corroboration charge despite giving\\n\\nsingle-witness charge likely did not affect trial outcome where other\\n\\nevidence and witness testimony, including that of other potential\\n\\naccomplices, implicated appellant in the crimes); Rice, 311 Ga. at\\n\\n                                 14\\n 623-24 (1) (clear error in failing to charge jury on accomplice\\n\\ncorroboration despite giving single-witness charge likely did not\\n\\naffect trial outcome where jury could have found accomplices’\\n\\ntestimony was mutually corroborating and where there was other\\n\\nsubstantial and consistent evidence showing appellant participated\\n\\nin crimes). Cf. Johnson, \\n305 Ga. at 241\\n (holding that trial court’s\\n\\nfailure to give accomplice-corroboration charge likely affected trial’s\\n\\noutcome where “virtually all of the incriminating evidence flowed\\n\\nfrom” accomplice).\\n\\n      Durden has not shown that the trial court’s clear error in\\n\\nfailing to give an accomplice-corroboration charge likely affected the\\n\\noutcome of his trial, and therefore he has not satisfied the third\\n\\nprong of the plain-error test. Accordingly, this enumeration of error\\n\\nalso fails.\\n\\n      3.      Durden contends that cumulatively, the trial court’s\\n\\nalleged errors were harmful and merit reversal. “When this Court\\n\\nhas identified or presumed more than one error, although the effect\\n\\nof each on its own might have been harmless,” we will “consider\\n\\n                                  15\\n collectively, rather than individually, the prejudicial effect, if any, of\\n\\nthe trial court errors.” Nundra v. State, \\n316 Ga. 1\\n, 16 (6) (\\n885 SE2d\\n\\n790\\n) (2023) (citations and punctuation omitted). Even considering\\n\\nthe assumed error in permitting Detective Carter’s identification\\n\\ntestimony and the error in failing to give an accomplice-\\n\\ncorroboration instruction, we conclude that Durden has not\\n\\ndemonstrated under the plain-error standard that, but for these\\n\\nerrors, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. As\\n\\nnoted above, Detective Carter’s identification testimony was\\n\\ncumulative of other unobjected-to testimony (mainly, that of the\\n\\naccomplices who also corroborated one another by both identifying\\n\\nDurden from the same surveillance footage), and there was ample\\n\\nevidence otherwise corroborating the accomplices’ testimony. Thus,\\n\\nthis claim fails.   See Payne, 314 Ga. at 334 (4) (no cumulative\\n\\nprejudice from failure to give accomplice-corroboration instruction\\n\\nand failure to object to hearsay testimony because hearsay\\n\\ntestimony was cumulative and “[t]he jury heard a significant\\n\\namount of incriminating testimony”).\\n\\n                                   16\\n      4.     Finally, although Durden does not raise the issue on\\n\\nappeal, “[w]hen the only murder conviction is for felony murder and\\n\\na defendant is convicted of both felony murder and the predicate\\n\\nfelony of the felony murder charge, the conviction for the predicate\\n\\nfelony merges into the felony murder conviction.” Allen v. State, \\n307\\n\\nGa. 707\\n, 710-11 (5) (\\n838 SE2d 301\\n) (2020) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted).    Because Durden’s conviction for felony murder is\\n\\npredicated on armed robbery, the trial court should not have\\n\\nseparately sentenced Durden on the armed robbery conviction.\\n\\nTherefore, we exercise our discretion to vacate Durden’s conviction\\n\\nand sentence for armed robbery. See Dixon v. State, \\n302 Ga. 691\\n,\\n\\n696-97 (4) (\\n808 SE2d 696\\n) (2017) (appellate court has discretion to\\n\\ncorrect merger error that is clear and obvious, particularly when\\n\\nsuch error harms the defendant).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed in part and vacated in part.

RICHARDSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       LAGRUA, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Matthew Richardson appeals his convictions for\\n\\nfelony murder and other crimes related to the shooting death of\\n\\nJulius Aderhold, III. 1 Richardson contends that (1) the trial court\\n\\ncommitted plain error when it admitted testimony of a detective that\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 The crimes occurred in Atlanta on January 30, 2018. On May 1, 2018,\\n\\na Fulton County grand jury indicted Richardson for felony murder predicated\\non aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Count 1), two counts of\\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon upon Jabari Johnson and Airieon\\nYoung (Counts 2 and 3), terroristic threats (Count 4), and possession of a\\nfirearm during the commission of a felony (Count 5). Richardson was tried in\\nNovember 2019, and the jury found him guilty of all counts. The trial court\\nsentenced Richardson to serve life in prison with the possibility of parole on\\nCount 1, a consecutive five-year term in prison on Count 5, and 20 years in\\nprison to run concurrent on Counts 2, 3, and 4. Richardson filed a timely\\nmotion for new trial, which was amended through new counsel. After holding\\nan evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion for new trial on June\\n6, 2023. Richardson filed a timely notice of appeal, and his case was docketed\\nto this Court’s term beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision\\non the briefs.\\n improperly     bolstered     out-of-court    statements      by   two    other\\n\\nwitnesses; and (2) his trial counsel provided constitutionally\\n\\nineffective assistance by failing to object to that same testimony.2\\n\\nFor the reasons explained below, we affirm.\\n\\n      1. This case involves a drive-by shooting on January 30, 2018,\\n\\nduring which Richardson’s friend and passenger Aderhold was shot\\n\\nand killed. The evidence presented at trial showed that Richardson\\n\\nwas upset with Jabari Johnson for his alleged involvement in\\n\\nstealing a gun belonging to Richardson’s cousin. Johnson testified\\n\\nthat, on January 29, Richardson called Johnson’s girlfriend and\\n\\nasked about the stolen gun. The next day, January 30, Richardson\\n\\nvisited Johnson’s house. Discovering that only Johnson’s two sisters\\n\\nwere home, Richardson called Johnson on the phone while standing\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Richardson also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\\n\\nhis conviction for terroristic threats. However, although he lists that claim as\\none of his enumerated errors, he presents no legal argument or citation of\\nauthority in support. Thus, this contention is deemed abandoned. See former\\nSupreme Court Rule 22 (2023) (“Any enumerated error not supported by\\nargument or citation of authority in the brief shall be deemed abandoned. . .\\n.”). See also Smith v. State, 315 Ga. 357, 358 n.2 (882 SE2d 289) (2022)\\n(deeming abandoned under former Rule 22 an unsupported claim of error\\npertaining to the sufficiency of the evidence).\\n                                       2\\n by the front door. Johnson and his two sisters testified that\\n\\nRichardson threatened Johnson during the call, telling him,\\n\\n“Somebody about to die about this gun today. I could kill your sister\\n\\nright now.” All three also testified that Richardson said he was going\\n\\nto go to the house of Johnson’s friend Aireon Young to “shoot it up.”\\n\\nAfter ten minutes of arguing with Johnson over the phone,\\n\\nRichardson left Johnson’s house.\\n\\n     At another point that afternoon at Young’s house, the mother\\n\\nof Young’s child was upstairs and saw a man standing outside the\\n\\nfront door holding a gun. She did not answer the door, but she called\\n\\nYoung and said a man was there with a gun. The man left by the\\n\\nend of this phone call. Young later told investigators that this man\\n\\nwas Richardson based on what his child’s mother told him, but at\\n\\ntrial, both Young and his child’s mother testified that they did not\\n\\nknow if the man was Richardson.\\n\\n     During these phone calls to Young and Johnson, Young was\\n\\ndriving Johnson and their friend Marquise Arnold to pick up\\n\\nArnold’s paycheck. In response to Richardson’s threats against\\n\\n                                   3\\n Johnson and Young, Young called Richardson to see what the\\n\\nproblem was. After that phone call, Young changed course and drove\\n\\nhome. Young’s mother, his young child, and his child’s mother were\\n\\npresent at the house. After Young, Johnson, and Arnold arrived,\\n\\nYoung’s family and Arnold went upstairs because Young told them\\n\\nRichardson was coming with a gun. Johnson went to the kitchen,\\n\\nand Young stood in front of the house talking on the phone with\\n\\nRichardson. Within minutes, Richardson drove an SUV into Young’s\\n\\nneighborhood. Aderhold was in the front passenger seat of the SUV,\\n\\nfacing the side of the street Young’s house was on.\\n\\n     Testimony at trial diverged about what happened next.\\n\\nJohnson testified that he heard approximately three gunshots while\\n\\ninside the house, grabbed a pistol, exited through the back door, and\\n\\nran along the side of the house to the front. On the street in front of\\n\\nthe house, Johnson saw Richardson leaning out of an SUV shooting\\n\\na handgun at him and Young. Johnson also witnessed Young\\n\\nshooting at Richardson, and Johnson began shooting at Richardson\\n\\nas well until his gun jammed, at which point he ran inside the house,\\n\\n                                  4\\n reloaded, and then ran back outside through the front door. Johnson\\n\\ntestified that he did not see who started shooting first because he\\n\\nwas inside; he did not know whether it was Richardson or Young.\\n\\n     Young testified that, while he was standing in front of his\\n\\nhouse, he saw Richardson driving up in an SUV and heard gunshots\\n\\ncoming from the direction of the street where the SUV was driving.\\n\\nYoung assumed Richardson was shooting at him, although he could\\n\\nnot see whether Richardson had a gun. Young began shooting at the\\n\\nSUV. At that moment, Young could not see Johnson, but believed he\\n\\nwas outside by the side of the house when the shooting began,\\n\\nexplaining that he thought so “because [Johnson was] still over\\n\\nthere, like, spazzing out and stuff, pacing back and forth . . . . talking\\n\\nto himself and stuff.” Young testified that, two months later,\\n\\nJohnson told him that he was the one who started shooting first, not\\n\\nRichardson. Johnson testified that he never told Young that he shot\\n\\nfirst and noted that he and Young were no longer friends due to a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    5\\n later incident.3\\n\\n      According to testimony from Young, Johnson, and others in the\\n\\nneighborhood, Richardson stopped the SUV a few houses away,\\n\\nexited, and ran to a neighbor’s house to find help. Young and\\n\\nJohnson went back inside Young’s house and waited for police to\\n\\narrive. Richardson got back in the SUV, but a police officer\\n\\nresponding to the scene stopped and apprehended him before he\\n\\ncould leave the neighborhood. The officer found Aderhold dead in the\\n\\npassenger seat, bleeding from a gunshot wound.\\n\\n      Investigators retrieved a .38-caliber revolver from behind the\\n\\ndriver’s seat in the SUV and a .40-caliber pistol underneath\\n\\nAderhold’s body. The gun behind the driver’s seat contained five\\n\\nspent shell casings, but the gun underneath Aderhold was fully\\n\\nloaded. Investigators also retrieved a 9mm pistol from Young and a\\n\\n.45-caliber pistol from Johnson. Several 9mm and .45-caliber casings\\n\\nwere recovered from the scene. The medical examiner testified that\\n\\n\\n      3 During trial, Young testified that he faced murder charges for a later,\\n\\nunrelated shooting. Johnson testified that he was also involved in that shooting\\nbut was not charged.\\n                                       6\\n Aderhold’s cause of death was a .45-caliber bullet that entered\\n\\nthrough his right shoulder and penetrated his head. Of the three\\n\\nshooters, only Johnson used a .45-caliber pistol.\\n\\n     That evening, Young and Johnson were taken to the police\\n\\nstation where Detective Nikita Moss interviewed them separately\\n\\nafter they waived their Miranda 4 rights. 5 During his interview,\\n\\nJohnson said that he heard gunshots while inside Young’s house,\\n\\nran outside through the back door, and began shooting back.\\n\\nAdditionally, Johnson told Detective Moss during his interview that\\n\\nthe initial “three shots didn’t come from [Young’s] gun.” At trial,\\n\\nJohnson gave a similar account and admitted that he implicated\\n\\nRichardson, but he testified that he did not know who shot first.\\n\\n     During Young’s interview, he told Detective Moss that he saw\\n\\nRichardson driving down the street “flashing” a handgun and that\\n\\nhe saw Richardson shoot first. At trial, Young admitted he told\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (86 SCt 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966).\\n     5 Young, Johnson, and Detective Moss testified regarding Young’s and\\n\\nJohnson’s out-of-court interview statements, and a video of Young’s interview\\nwas played for the jury. «T10 1166-67, 1234, 1248, 1257»\\n                                     7\\n Detective Moss that Richardson shot first, but he repeatedly\\n\\ntestified that he lied during that interview and did not actually see\\n\\nwho shot first.\\n\\n     While under direct examination at trial, Detective Moss\\n\\ntestified as follows regarding her interviews of Young and Johnson:\\n\\n     STATE:       What about Dominique Young, while you\\n                  talked to him, did he talk freely to you?\\n     MOSS:        Yes.\\n     STATE:       Did he speak as if what he said was rehearsed?\\n     MOSS:        No.\\n     STATE:       Did every detail that he gave to you, did it\\n                  sound from talking with both Jabari Johnson\\n                  and Dominique Young as if they were\\n                  attempting to give you the same story?\\n     MOSS:        No, ma’am.\\n     STATE:       And why do you say that?\\n     MOSS:        From details that Dominique gave, some were\\n                  not the same as Jabari’s. For instance,\\n                  Dominique stated that Jabari was outside with\\n                  him and ran to the side of the house, but Jabari\\n                  said he walked outside when he heard the\\n                  shots, ran back through the house to the side of\\n                  the house.\\n     STATE:       And were both of them talking about various\\n                  times? Like, in other words, as they are talking\\n                  to you, are they talking conversationally?\\n     MOSS:        Yes.\\n     STATE:       Okay. And did they seem as if they were\\n                  searching for what the truth was while they\\n                  were talking to you?\\n\\n                                    8\\n      MOSS:      Yes.\\n     STATE:     Did they seem to have trouble figuring out or\\n                telling you what the truth was?\\n     MOSS:      What do you mean?\\n     STATE:     What I mean is, did they seem to have any\\n                trouble telling you what they were recounting?\\n     MOSS:      No.\\n     STATE:     And was the information that they were\\n                recounting coming freely?\\n     MOSS:      Yes.\\n\\nRichardson’s trial counsel did not object to this testimony.\\n\\n     2. On appeal, Richardson contends that—when Detective Moss\\n\\nanswered “yes” to the prosecutor’s question, “Did they seem as if\\n\\nthey were searching for what the truth was while they were talking\\n\\nto you?”—Detective Moss improperly bolstered Young’s and\\n\\nJohnson’s interview statements that Richardson shot at them first\\n\\nand they only returned fire in self-defense. Richardson argues that\\n\\nthe trial court committed plain error by admitting Detective Moss’s\\n\\ntestimony at trial and that his trial counsel was ineffective for not\\n\\nobjecting to the testimony. We hold that Richardson has failed to\\n\\nshow plain error or ineffective assistance of counsel.\\n\\n     We have explained that, pursuant to OCGA § 24-6-620,\\n\\n\\n                                  9\\n      a witness, even an expert, can never bolster the credibility\\n     of another witness as to whether the witness is telling the\\n     truth. Credibility of a witness is not beyond the ken of the\\n     jurors but, to the contrary, is a matter solely within the\\n     province of the jury. When a witness’s statement does not\\n     directly address the credibility of another witness,\\n     however, there is no improper bolstering. And when we\\n     evaluate whether testimony constitutes improper\\n     bolstering, we consider the disputed testimony in context.\\n\\nBrown v. State, 302 Ga. 454, 460-461 (2) (b) (807 SE2d 369) (2017)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     (a) We apply the plain-error standard to evidentiary rulings to\\n\\nwhich the appellant did not object at trial. Pender v. State, 311 Ga.\\n\\n98, 111 (3) (856 SE2d 302) (2021); OCGA § 24-1-103 (d). To establish\\n\\nplain error, Richardson “must point to a legal error that was not\\n\\naffirmatively waived, was clear and obvious beyond reasonable\\n\\ndispute, affected his substantial rights, and seriously affected the\\n\\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.”\\n\\nCarter v. State, 317 Ga. 689, 693 (2) (895 SE2d 295) (2023) (citations\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). However, if Richardson fails to show just\\n\\none of these elements, we need not analyze the rest. Id.\\n\\n     Any error here was not clear and obvious beyond reasonable\\n\\n                                 10\\n dispute. “For an error to be obvious for purposes of plain-error\\n\\nreview, it must be plain under controlling precedent or in view of the\\n\\nunequivocally clear words of a statute or rule.” Grier v. State, 313\\n\\nGa. 236, 242 (2) (b) (869 SE2d 423) (2022). We have interpreted\\n\\nOCGA § 24-6-620 to mean that a witness may not “directly address\\n\\nthe credibility of another. . . .” Brown, 302 Ga. at 460-461 (2) (b)\\n\\n(emphasis supplied). But our precedents permit a witness to still\\n\\ntestify about another witness’s statements in ways that do not\\n\\ndirectly comment on that witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Pender, 311\\n\\nGa. at 113 (3) (“While it would have been improper for the detective\\n\\nto testify about whether he believed [the witness] was telling the\\n\\ntruth, it was permissible for the detective to discuss whether [the\\n\\nwitness’s] statements to him . . . were consistent with other\\n\\ninformation. . . .”); Ivey v. State, 305 Ga. 156, 161-162 (2) (c) (824\\n\\nSE2d 242) (2019) (holding that a detective’s testimony that the\\n\\ndefendant’s “demeanor changed . . . you could tell that the wheels\\n\\nwere turning” was not a “direct comment on [the defendant’s]\\n\\nveracity”); Harris v. State, 304 Ga. 652, 657 (2) (c) (821 SE2d 346)\\n\\n                                 11\\n (2018) (holding that a detective’s testimony that shooting victims\\n\\n“tell you the whole story about what happened” and “that is basically\\n\\nthe pattern that [I] saw here” was not a direct comment on the victim\\n\\nwitness’s credibility). 6\\n\\n      Here, we consider the “disputed testimony in context.” Brown,\\n\\n302 Ga. at 461 (2) (b). Considering the other questions asked of\\n\\nDetective Moss, it appears her testimony only explained how Young\\n\\nand Johnson said what they said, which is not necessarily a direct\\n\\ncomment on their credibility. Indeed, the next question from the\\n\\nprosecutor was whether Young and Johnson had “trouble figuring\\n\\nout or telling you what the truth was,” which the prosecutor\\n\\nrephrased to, “What I mean is, did they seem to have any trouble\\n\\ntelling you what they were recounting?” Depending on context, a\\n\\nmere reference to “the truth” does not necessarily indicate direct\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 We note that this   Court has often used the words “credibility” and\\n“veracity” interchangeably in analyzing OCGA § 24-6-620. See, e.g., Harris,\\n304 Ga. at 657 (2) (c) (“Viewed in context, Detective Puhala’s testimony was\\nnot a direct comment on Ellison’s veracity. When a witness’s statement does\\nnot directly address the credibility of another witness, there is no improper\\nbolstering.” (citation and punctuation omitted)). In so doing, we have not\\nascribed different meanings to those words, and we likewise ascribe none here.\\n                                     12\\n testimony on whether one is telling the truth. See Bedford v. State,\\n\\n311 Ga. 329, 335-336 (4) (857 SE2d 708) (2021) (holding that, in\\n\\ncontext, a witness’s testimony that “the truth stays very similar”\\n\\nwas not improper bolstering because it only addressed whether\\n\\nanother witness’s statements were consistent with other evidence),\\n\\ndisapproved of on other grounds in Clark v. State, 315 Ga. 423, 436\\n\\n(3) (b) n.16 (883 SE2d 317) (2023). In context here, Detective Moss’s\\n\\nuse of the phrase “searching for what the truth was” did not directly\\n\\naddress the credibility of Young and Johnson but instead focused on\\n\\ntheir demeanors. See Ivey, 305 Ga. at 162 (2) (c). Accordingly, we\\n\\nhold that Detective Moss’s testimony was not a clear and obvious\\n\\ncase of improper bolstering, so Richardson has failed to establish\\n\\nplain error from the admission of this testimony. See Jones v. State,\\n\\n299 Ga. 40, 44 (3) (785 SE2d 886) (2016).\\n\\n     (b) To show ineffective assistance of counsel for his trial\\n\\ncounsel’s failure to object to Detective Moss’s testimony, Richardson\\n\\n“must prove both that his trial counsel’s performance was deficient\\n\\nand that there is a reasonable probability that the trial result would\\n\\n                                 13\\n have been different if not for the deficient performance.” Harris, 304\\n\\nGa. at 654 (2) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (104\\n\\nSCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984)). As with plain error, if Richardson\\n\\nfails to meet the requirements of one element of the Strickland test,\\n\\nwe need not analyze the other. Harris, 304 Ga. at 654 (2).\\n\\n      We hold that Richardson has failed to show that his trial\\n\\ncounsel’s performance was deficient. “To satisfy the deficiency\\n\\nprong, [Richardson] must demonstrate that his attorney performed\\n\\nat trial in an objectively unreasonable way considering all the\\n\\ncircumstances and in the light of prevailing professional norms.”\\n\\nHarris v. State, 310 Ga. 372, 384 (4) (850 SE2d 77) (2020) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). We have already held that this testimony\\n\\nwas not a clear case of improper bolstering. Accordingly, we cannot\\n\\nsay that no reasonable lawyer would have failed to object to such\\n\\ntestimony on the grounds of improper bolstering.7 See Ivey, 305 Ga.\\n\\n\\n      7 That Richardson’s trial counsel testified at the motion-for-new-trial\\nhearing that she now understood the statement to be bolstering and had no\\nstrategy behind failing to object does not change our analysis. Our standard is\\nobjective reasonableness and we are not constrained to “the subjective reasons\\n\\n                                      14\\n at 162 (2) (c) (“Because [the detective’s] testimony was not a direct\\n\\ncomment on Ivey’s veracity . . . Ivey has not shown that no\\n\\nreasonable lawyer would have failed to object to [the detective’s]\\n\\ntestimony.”)     (citation   and     punctuation      omitted).    Therefore,\\n\\nRichardson’s claims fail.\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\noffered by trial counsel for [her] conduct.” Lane v.

But this is not a proper case to\\n\\nconsider those developments. Even if Victory Media’s legal\\n\\narguments are correct, they still lose; the parts of the law that may\\n\\nviolate the First Amendment are not the parts of the law that\\n\\nharmed Victory Media. Accordingly, I concur in the denial of the\\n\\npetition for a writ of certiorari, but write to flag this important issue\\n\\nfor future litigants and courts.\\n\\n     This case centers on Victory Media’s attempt to obtain a\\n\\n                                   2\\n multiple     message        sign   permit      from     the    Department        of\\n\\nTransportation.       The     Department        approved      Victory     Media’s\\n\\napplication but later revoked the permit because another sign,\\n\\nwhich was already established pursuant to a permit, was located\\n\\nless than 5,000 feet from the requested location for Victory Media’s\\n\\nmultiple message sign. See OCGA § 32-6-75 (c) (1) (C) (“No . . .\\n\\nmultiple message sign shall be placed within 5,000 feet of another\\n\\nmultiple message sign on the same side of the highway[.]”). In\\n\\nappealing the Department’s decision, Victory Media challenges\\n\\namong other things the constitutionality of the Outdoor Advertising\\n\\nControl Act (“the Act”), which governs the permit application process\\n\\nfor outdoor advertising signs. Victory Media contends the Act is\\n\\nunconstitutional because it imposes content-based restrictions on\\n\\nspeech.1\\n\\n\\n\\n      1  For instance, Victory Media points to the Act’s direction that “[n]o\\noutdoor advertising shall be erected or maintained within 660 feet of the\\nnearest edge of the right of way and visible from the main traveled way of the\\ninterstate or primary highways in this state, except the following: (1)\\n[d]irectional and other official signs and notices; (2) [s]igns advertising the sale\\nor lease of the property upon which they are located; (3) [s]igns advertising\\n\\n                                         3\\n       In defense of the Act, the State relied below on our decision in\\n\\nDOT v. Shiflett, where this Court rejected a claim that the Act\\n\\nviolated the right to free speech and held that it did “not violate the\\n\\nfreedom of expression.” 2 \\n251 Ga. 873\\n, 876 (1) (\\n310 SE2d 509\\n) (1984).\\n\\nBecause the case involved commercial speech and we concluded that\\n\\nthe Act indirectly controlled expression, we applied the four-part\\n\\nanalysis from Central Hudson Gas v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 447 U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nactivities conducted or maintained within 100 feet of the nearest part of the\\nactivity . . . ; (4) [s]igns located in areas zoned commercial or industrial, which\\nsigns provide information in the specific interest of the traveling public; (5)\\n[s]igns located in unzoned commercial or industrial areas, which signs provide\\ninformation in the specific interest of the traveling public; and (6) [d]irectional\\nsigns, displays, and devices about goods and services in the specific interest of\\nthe traveling public[.]” See OCGA § 32-6-72. Appellant contends that the “Act\\nfurther restricts permissible signs based on the type of message contained in\\nthe sign[,]” and in support Appellant points to the “spacing, location, and\\nconfiguration requirements” and various exemptions in the Act.\\n       2 We did not specify whether the free speech claim was brought only\\n\\nunder the U.S. Constitution or was also brought under a similar provision of\\nthe Georgia Constitution. Our analysis cited only federal caselaw decided\\nunder the First Amendment. Accordingly, I do not understand Shiflett to have\\ndecided anything about the Georgia Constitution’s speech protections, and note\\nfurther that there’s ample reason to think those protections may be different\\nfrom their federal equivalent. See, e.g., Maxim Cabaret, Inc. v. City of Sandy\\nSprings, \\n304 Ga. 187\\n, 196-197 (\\n816 SE2d 31\\n) (2018) (Peterson, J., concurring)\\n(noting textual differences between federal and state provisions).\\n                                        4\\n 557 (100 SCt 2343, 65 LE2d 341) (1980).3 See Shiflett, \\n251 Ga. at\\n\\n874-875\\n (1).\\n\\n     But the State’s reliance on Shiflett is misplaced. To begin, we\\n\\ndid not consider there whether the Act contained content-based\\n\\nrestrictions on speech, which United States Supreme Court\\n\\nprecedent now makes clear is a critical consideration. See Nat. Inst.\\n\\nof Fam. and Life Advocs. v. Becerra (“NIFLA”), \\n585 U.S. 755\\n, 766 (II)\\n\\n(A) (138 SCt 2361, 201 LE2d 835) (2018) (“When enforcing [the First\\n\\nAmendment’s] prohibition [on laws that abridge the freedom of\\n\\nspeech], precedents distinguish between content-based and content-\\n\\nneutral regulations of speech.”).\\n\\n     “Content-based laws — those that target speech based on its\\n\\ncommunicative content — are presumptively unconstitutional and\\n\\nmay be justified only if the government proves that they are\\n\\n\\n     3   That analysis considers whether (1) the commercial speech was\\nmisleading or concerned an unlawful activity, (2) the governmental interest\\nwas substantial, (3) the regulation directly advanced the government interest,\\nand (4) the regulation was more extensive than necessary to serve that\\ninterest. See Shiflett, \\n251 Ga. at 874\\n (1); H&H Operations, Inc. v. City of\\nPeachtree City, \\n248 Ga. 500\\n, 502 (2) (\\n283 SE2d 867\\n) (1981) (striking down sign\\nordinance because we found “no substantial governmental interest in\\npermitting commercial signs yet prohibiting the posting of prices”).\\n                                      5\\n narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.” Reed v.

Reagan National Advertising of Austin, LLC, the\\n\\nUnited States Supreme Court indicated that “restrictions on speech may\\nrequire some evaluation of the speech and nonetheless remain content neutral”\\nand held that a regulation’s distinction between on-premise and off-premise\\nsigns was content neutral because it did not turn on the substantive message\\nof the sign. \\n596 U.S. 61\\n, 72-74 (II) (B) (142 SCt 1464, 212 LE2d 418) (2022).\\nBut the statute here purports to distinguish permissible off-premise signs from\\nimpermissible off-premise signs based in part on content, which creates\\ndifferent issues than the ordinance at issue in City of Austin.\\n                                      6\\n at 172 (IV).\\n\\n     At the time that Shiflett was decided, it had “[o]nly recently . .\\n\\n. been recognized that commercial speech is afforded protection\\n\\nunder the First Amendment.” Shiflett, \\n251 Ga. at 874\\n (1). See\\n\\nNIFLA, 585 U.S. at 767 (II) (B) (“professional speech” is not exempt\\n\\nfrom the normal prohibition on content-based restrictions); see also\\n\\nSorrell v. IMS Health Inc., \\n564 U.S. 552\\n, 566 (II) (A) (1) (131 SCt\\n\\n2653, 180 LE2d 544) (2011) (“[c]ommercial speech is no exception”\\n\\nto the general rule that content-based restrictions of speech warrant\\n\\nheightened judicial scrutiny). To satisfy its burden to justify that a\\n\\ncontent-based restriction on commercial speech is consistent with\\n\\nthe First Amendment, the State must show “at least that the\\n\\n[burden] directly advances a substantial governmental interest and\\n\\nthat the measure is drawn to achieve that interest.” Sorrell, \\n564 U.S.\\n\\nat 571-572\\n (II) (B). This standard requires a proportional fit\\n\\n“between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen to accomplish\\n\\nthose ends.” \\nId.\\n\\n\\n     In the light of this precedent, this Court has since struck down\\n\\n                                  7\\n local sign ordinances that contained such content-based distinctions.\\n\\nSee Fulton County v. Galberaith, \\n282 Ga. 314\\n, 317-319 (3) (\\n647 SE2d\\n\\n24\\n) (2007) (affirming trial court’s ruling that sign ordinance that\\n\\nbanned all signs, including commercial ones, but exempted signs\\n\\nfrom the ban on a case-by-case basis was the “the antithesis of the\\n\\nnarrow tailoring that is required under the First Amendment, even\\n\\nin the context of commercial speech”); Union City Bd. of Zoning\\n\\nAppeals v. Justice Outdoor Displays, Inc., \\n266 Ga. 393\\n, 394-398 (\\n467\\n\\nSE2d 875\\n) (1996) (striking down sign ordinances because they\\n\\nimposed content-based restrictions on speech). But we have yet to\\n\\naddress whether the Outdoor Advertising Control Act contains such\\n\\ncontent-based restrictions, and that important question remains\\n\\nopen in our precedent. See State v. Cafe Erotica, Inc., \\n270 Ga. 97\\n, 97\\n\\n(\\n507 SE2d 732\\n) (1998) (resolving challenge to the Act under Central\\n\\nHudson test without reaching whether the “legislation [was]\\n\\ncontent-based and therefore . . . subject to strict scrutiny”).\\n\\n     Victory Media points to provisions of the Act and regulations\\n\\npromulgated under the Act that may well be content-based. See, e.g.,\\n\\n                                   8\\n OCGA § 32-6-71 (defining among other things categories of signs\\n\\nreferenced in the Act); OCGA § 32-6-72 (limiting outdoor advertising\\n\\nvisible from the main traveled way of the state’s interstate or\\n\\nprimary highways to specific categories of signs); OCGA § 32-6-75\\n\\n(a) (establishing additional conditions associated with certain\\n\\ncategories of permissible signs); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs., r. 672-6-.03\\n\\n(requiring a permit before the construction of certain categories of\\n\\nsigns). But none of those provisions were actually enforced against\\n\\nVictory Media. Instead, Victory Media’s permit was revoked because\\n\\nOCGA § 32-6-75 (c) (1) (C) directs that “[n]o multiple message sign .\\n\\n. . be placed within 5,000 feet of another multiple message sign on\\n\\nthe same side of the highway[,]” and the Department had already\\n\\napproved the permit of another multiple message sign located less\\n\\nthan 5,000 feet from the location that Victory Media requested.\\n\\n     Our caselaw requires a party challenging a state statute as\\n\\nunconstitutional to show that the unconstitutional provision\\n\\nharmed the party. See Parker v. Leeuwenburg, \\n300 Ga. 789\\n, 790 (\\n797\\n\\nSE2d 908\\n)   (2017)   (“As   a   prerequisite   to   attacking   the\\n\\n                                  9\\n constitutionality of a statute, the complaining party must show that\\n\\nit is hurtful to the attacker.”); Black Voters Matter Fund, Inc. v.\\n\\nKemp, \\n313 Ga. 375\\n, 393 (\\n870 SE2d 430\\n) (2022) (Peterson, J.,\\n\\nconcurring) (“One clear line of case law . . . holds that persons\\n\\nseeking to challenge a state statute as unconstitutional may do so\\n\\nonly if that statute has injured them in some specific way.”).5 Victory\\n\\nMedia has failed to make that showing, and so we cannot reach the\\n\\nopen constitutional question they raise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     5 Victory Media did not challenge the Act on overbreadth grounds.

I concur with the denial of\\n\\ncertiorari because I agree that the municipal court could not order\\n\\nthe measures that it did, but for different reasons not discussed by\\n\\nthe Court of Appeals. See 400 Edgewood, LLC v. City of Atlanta, \\n369\\n\\nGa. App. 673\\n, 674 (\\n893 SE2d 156\\n) (2023).\\n\\n     The factual and procedural background as laid out by the Court\\n\\nof Appeals is as follows:\\n\\n           400 Edgewood, LLC (“Edgewood”), owns a gas\\n     station and convenience store located at 400 Edgewood\\n     Avenue (“the Property”) in downtown Atlanta. After\\n     numerous criminal incidents occurred on or near the\\n     Property, the City of Atlanta (“the City”) filed a complaint\\n     in rem to abate an alleged public nuisance at the Property\\n     pursuant to OCGA § 41-2-1 et seq., and the Atlanta\\n     Municipal Code Art. 1 §§ 19 and 25. Specifically, the City\\n     alleged that “it is the duty of the owners and occupants of\\n     any premises to maintain [the] property in a state of good\\n     repair and in conformance with State and local law and\\n     clear of any public or attractive nuisance.” The City\\n    alleged that the owner/occupiers of the Property “failed to\\n    discharge these duties” and that the “criminal and\\n    unlawful activity occurring at the subject Property”\\n    constituted a public nuisance. The City requested that the\\n    municipal court “close and immediately secure the\\n    Property so that it cannot be used in connection with the\\n    commission of illegal activity.”\\n\\n          After a hearing, the municipal court judge entered\\n    an order finding that “the evidence presented was\\n    insufficient to support a finding that the Property itself\\n    created a public nuisance[.]” . . . However, the municipal\\n    court also found that “the evidence support[ed] a finding\\n    that the operation of the business at the Property [was] a\\n    nuisance.” (Emphasis supplied.) The municipal court then\\n    ordered Edgewood to install additional security cameras,\\n    hire “competent security,” and reduce the hours of\\n    operation of the gas station and convenience store for one\\n    year.\\n\\n         Edgewood filed a petition for certiorari review in the\\n    superior court, which affirmed the municipal court's\\n    order. [The Court of Appeals] granted Edgewood's\\n    application for discretionary appeal[.]\\n\\nId. at 673-74 (citation and punctuation omitted). The Court of\\n\\nAppeals   reversed,   concluding    that    the      municipal   court\\n\\nimpermissibly   entered   injunctive   relief   by    “impos[ing]   an\\n\\naffirmative duty on Edgewood to both perform (by enhancing\\n\\nsecurity measures) and refrain from performing (by limiting the\\n\\n                                2\\n business’s hours of operation) specific acts.” Id. at 674 (citing Adams\\n\\nv. Madison County Planning & Zoning, \\n271 Ga. App. 333\\n, 334 (1)\\n\\n(\\n609 SE2d 681\\n) (2005) (“[I]njunctions are within the exclusive\\n\\njurisdiction of the superior and appellate courts.”)). Having so\\n\\nconcluded, the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to consider\\n\\nwhether “the municipal court exceeded its in rem authority under\\n\\nOCGA § 41-2-1 et seq.” Id. n.5.\\n\\n     It is difficult to see, however, how the Court of Appeals could\\n\\nconclude that the municipal court acted beyond its jurisdiction in\\n\\npurportedly abating the nuisance, without grappling with OCGA §\\n\\n41-2-5. OCGA § 41-2-5 provides: “If the existence of a nuisance is\\n\\ncomplained of in a county or city of this state, the municipal court of\\n\\nthe city, if the nuisance complained of is in the city, shall have\\n\\njurisdiction to hear and determine the question of the existence of\\n\\nsuch nuisance and, if found to exist, to order its abatement.”\\n\\n(emphasis added). We have long held that under OCGA § 41-2-5 and\\n\\nits predecessors, a municipal court has the power to abate nuisances.\\n\\nSee Horne v. City of Cordele, \\n254 Ga. 346\\n, 348 (2) (\\n329 SE2d 134\\n)\\n\\n                                  3\\n (1985) (acknowledging a recorder court’s “power to abate nuisances\\n\\npursuant to the legislative authorization in OCGA § 41-2-5”); City of\\n\\nAtlanta v. Wolcott, \\n240 Ga. 244\\n, 244 (\\n240 SE2d 83\\n) (1977) (stating\\n\\nthat OCGA § 41-2-5’s materially similar predecessor “provides that\\n\\nthe police court of such city shall have jurisdiction to . . . order [a\\n\\nnuisance’s] abatement”); Yield, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, \\n239 Ga. 578\\n,\\n\\n579 (\\n238 SE2d 351\\n) (1977) (“Appellee . . . proceeded under [OCGA §\\n\\n41-2-5’s materially similar predecessor] which authorizes a\\n\\nmunicipal court to determine the existence of and abate nuisances”\\n\\n(emphasis added)).\\n\\n      The question then is whether the municipal court, in ordering\\n\\nthe relief it did, acted within its authority under OCGA § 41-2-5 to\\n\\norder a nuisance be abated. 1 Wolcott answers this question. See 240\\n\\n\\n      1 The other question, which the parties do not raise before us and I do\\n\\nnot answer, is whether OCGA § 41-2-5 violates Article VI, Section I, Paragraph\\nIV (“Par. IV”) of the 1983 Georgia Constitution, which provides that “only the\\nsuperior and appellate courts and state-wide business court shall have the\\npower to issue process in the nature of . . . injunction.” This constitutional\\nquestion hinges on whether a nuisance-abatement order is inherently an\\ninjunction. In raising this issue, I note that Paragraph I of Art. VI, Sec. I of the\\n1983 Georgia Constitution, which provides that “[m]unicipal courts shall have\\njurisdiction over ordinance violations and such other jurisdiction as provided\\nby law,” may also bear on whether OCGA § 41-2-5 is constitutional.\\n                                         4\\n Ga. at 244-45. In Wolcott, property owners alleged that they were\\n\\nharmed by the continued use of an adjacent recreational park\\n\\nmaintained by the City of Atlanta and filed an action in superior\\n\\ncourt seeking nuisance abatement. See id. at 244. The superior court\\n\\nordered the City to “submit a plan for abatement” of a nuisance, and\\n\\nthe City appealed, arguing that under \\nGa. Code Ann. § 72-401\\n (a\\n\\nmaterially similar predecessor to OCGA § 41-2-5), the superior court\\n\\nlacked original jurisdiction over a nuisance abatement action\\n\\nbecause a city “police court” was the proper forum under § 72-401.\\n\\nSee id. We disagreed, reasoning that § 72-401 did not provide “a\\n\\ncomplete and adequate remedy at law,” because the nuisance\\n\\ncomplained of “did not result from the existence of a nuisance per se\\n\\nbut from the continuing overuse of the park by members of the\\n\\npublic, absent controls.” Id. at 244-45. The relief ordered was that\\n\\nthe City “develop a plan to control the public use of the park,” rather\\n\\nthan “the removal of the recreational facilities as is contemplated by\\n\\n[ ] § 72-401.” Id. at 245. Because the relief ordered “would have been\\n\\nbeyond the power of the municipal court of Atlanta,” “jurisdiction\\n\\n                                  5\\n was properly maintained in the Superior Court.” Id. at 244-45\\n\\n(referencing Ga. Const. of 1976, Art. VI, Sec. IV, Par. I (“The\\n\\nSuperior Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction in . . . equity\\n\\ncases.”)).\\n\\n     Wolcott supports that the relief granted in this case is also\\n\\n“beyond the power of the municipal court.” \\n240 Ga. at 245\\n. Here, the\\n\\nCity of Atlanta originally filed a complaint in rem to abate an alleged\\n\\npublic nuisance on the owner’s property, requesting the municipal\\n\\ncourt to ‘“close and immediately secure the Property so that it cannot\\n\\nbe used in connection with the commission of illegal activity.’” 400\\n\\nEdgewood, LLC, 369 Ga. App. at 673. But while the municipal court\\n\\nfound “the operation of the business at the Property” to be a\\n\\nnuisance, it did not find that the “Property itself created a public\\n\\nnuisance.” Id. at 673-74 (emphasis omitted). At this point then, the\\n\\nmunicipal court should have denied the City’s in rem abatement\\n\\naction. Instead, the court ordered the property owner “to install\\n\\nadditional security cameras, hire ‘competent security,’ and reduce\\n\\nthe hours of operation of the gas station and convenience store for\\n\\n                                  6\\n one year.” Id. at 674. Ordering these changes to how the owner\\n\\ncontrolled and operated its business on the property—rather than\\n\\nordering the property itself be closed—was injunctive relief beyond\\n\\nthe municipal court’s authority under OCGA § 41-2-5 to order a\\n\\nnuisance abated.

EVERETT v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       BETHEL, Justice.\\n\\n       Jerome Everett was convicted of felony murder and other\\n\\ncrimes in connection with the shooting death of Keith Nelson.1\\n\\nEverett contends that the trial court erred by giving an incorrect\\n\\njury instruction on justification and that his trial counsel rendered\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 The crimes occurred in the early morning of March 28, 2008. On June\\n\\n24, 2008, a Fulton County grand jury indicted Everett for malice murder\\n(Count 1), felony murder predicated on aggravated assault (Count 2),\\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Count 3), possession of a firearm\\nduring the commission of a felony (Count 4), and possession of a firearm by a\\nconvicted felon (Count 5). Following a jury trial from March 29 to April 6, 2010,\\nthe jury found Everett not guilty of malice murder (Count 1), but guilty on the\\nremaining counts. The trial court sentenced Everett to serve life in prison on\\nCount 2 and a consecutive term of five years in prison on Count 4; Count 3\\nmerged into Count 2. Everett pled guilty to Count 5 and was sentenced to serve\\na concurrent term of five years in prison.\\n       Everett filed a timely motion for new trial, which was amended 12 years\\nlater through counsel. Following a hearing on August 8, 2023, the trial court\\ndenied the amended motion on September 28, 2023. Everett then filed a timely\\nnotice of appeal, and his appeal was docketed to this Court’s term commencing\\nin December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n ineffective assistance by failing to object to the State’s use of his\\n\\nprior convictions as impeachment evidence. But the jury instruction,\\n\\neven if erroneous, was a harmless error, and the ineffective\\n\\nassistance claim fails because trial counsel was not deficient.\\n\\nAccordingly, we affirm.2\\n\\n      1. The evidence presented at trial showed the following. 3 On\\n\\nMarch 28, 2008, Nelson’s next-door neighbor awoke around 2:30\\n\\na.m. to the sound of loud noises coming from Nelson’s condominium,\\n\\nincluding Nelson’s cries for help followed by what sounded like two\\n\\ngunshots. The neighbor called the police, and then she heard\\n\\nsomeone run down a flight of stairs, followed by a third gunshot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 We are troubled by the inordinate and unexplained delay between the\\n\\nfiling of Everett’s motion for new trial in 2010 and the filing of an amended\\nmotion 12 years later. So, yet again, we remind the bench and bar that long\\npost-conviction delays “put at risk the rights of defendants and crime victims\\nand the validity of convictions obtained after a full trial,” and we “reiterate\\nthat it is the duty of all those involved in the criminal justice system . . . to\\nensure that the appropriate post-conviction motions are filed, litigated, and\\ndecided without unnecessary delay.” Owens v. State, \\n303 Ga. 254\\n, 258 (\\n811\\nSE2d 420\\n) (2018) (citation and punctuation omitted.).\\n       3 Because this case requires our assessment of whether an instructional\\n\\nerror was harmless, see Division 2 below, we review the record de novo and\\nweigh the evidence as we would expect reasonable jurors to have done. See\\nJones v. State, \\n316 Ga. 481\\n, 486 (2) (\\n888 SE2d 91\\n) (2023).\\n                                       2\\n Police responded to the call and entered Nelson’s home through the\\n\\nbalcony door. Inside, the police found signs of a struggle, bloody\\n\\nfootprints on the stairs leading to the front door, and Nelson’s body\\n\\nlying in a pool of blood near the front door. Nelson was declared dead\\n\\nby a paramedic, and it was later determined that he died from blood\\n\\nloss caused by a gunshot wound that perforated his femoral artery.\\n\\nNelson also had two gunshot wounds to his abdomen and a number\\n\\nof superficial injuries.\\n\\n     Officers spotted a man, who was later determined to be\\n\\nEverett, “walking briskly” away from the condo, carrying something.\\n\\nOfficers eventually stopped Everett and returned him to the crime\\n\\nscene. The officers found Nelson’s car and house keys in Everett’s\\n\\npockets, and they found blood that was later determined to be\\n\\nNelson’s on Everett’s clothes and shoes. In the area where Everett\\n\\nwas apprehended, officers found a flatscreen television, which\\n\\nEverett later admitted to stealing from Nelson’s condominium, and\\n\\na pair of bloody gloves. Officers also discovered a partially loaded\\n\\ngun in the area where Everett was apprehended, and a firearms\\n\\n                                  3\\n examiner determined that three shell casings found at the crime\\n\\nscene were fired from the gun.\\n\\n     At trial, Everett testified in his own defense, admitting to\\n\\nshooting Nelson, but claiming he did so in self-defense. Everett\\n\\ntestified that he was working as a prostitute the night of the murder,\\n\\nand that while he was at Nelson’s home, Nelson took off his pants,\\n\\nattempted to renegotiate their agreement, and pressured him for\\n\\nsexual acts they had not agreed on. Everett explained that, during\\n\\nthe back-and-forth, Nelson produced a gun and pointed it at him.\\n\\nThe two men then fought over the gun, and it fired. Everett further\\n\\ntestified that, after the gun first discharged, Nelson grabbed a large\\n\\nkitchen knife and that the gun, which by then Everett was holding,\\n\\nfired a second time. Nelson then dropped the knife but kept fighting\\n\\nand, at some point, fell down the stairs to the first floor. Everett\\n\\nclaimed that, as he tried to pass the unarmed Nelson to exit the\\n\\ncondo, Nelson grabbed his leg and tried to attack him. Everett tried\\n\\nto stop him, and the gun, which Everett was still holding, fired a\\n\\nthird time. According to Everett, he then went back upstairs, put on\\n\\n                                  4\\n gloves he found in his backpack, took Nelson’s television as\\n\\n“payment,” and lowered the television and himself off Nelson’s\\n\\nbalcony.\\n\\n     2. In his first enumeration of error, Everett argues that the\\n\\ntrial court erred in its jury charge with respect to the law of\\n\\njustification. Specifically, Everett points to a portion of the jury\\n\\ncharge that deviated from the pattern jury charge in a manner that\\n\\nhe contends could have misled the jury into believing that\\n\\njustification was not available as a defense to Everett if he was\\n\\nattempting to commit, committing, or fleeing after committing a\\n\\ntheft offense that was not a felony. While we agree the instruction\\n\\nwas not as clear as it could have been, any error in giving the\\n\\ninstruction was harmless because the jury was highly unlikely to\\n\\nhave believed the use of deadly force was justified in the first place.\\n\\n     The relevant pattern jury instruction in effect at the time of\\n\\nEverett’s 2010 trial provided that “[a] person is not justified in using\\n\\nforce if that person . . . is attempting to commit, is committing, or is\\n\\nfleeing after the commission or attempted commission of a felony\\n\\n                                   5\\n (define arguable felony).” Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol.\\n\\nII: Criminal Cases (4th ed.) § 3.10.10 (b) (4th ed. 2007). See also\\n\\nOCGA § 16-3-21 (b) (2) (providing that “[a] person is not justified in\\n\\nusing force under the circumstances specified in subsection (a) of\\n\\nthis Code section if he . . . [i]s attempting to commit, committing, or\\n\\nfleeing after the commission or attempted commission of a felony”).\\n\\nHowever, when the trial court charged the jury, it omitted the\\n\\nreference to a “felony,” and instructed that a person is not justified\\n\\nin using force to defend himself if he is “attempting to commit, is\\n\\ncommitting, or is fleeing after the commission or attempted\\n\\ncommission of a theft.” (Emphasis supplied.) The court did not define\\n\\n“theft” for the jury. The trial court overruled Everett’s objection to\\n\\nthe charge.\\n\\n     The State’s theory at trial was that Everett, armed with a gun,\\n\\nwent to Nelson’s home with the intent to rob him. The State argues\\n\\nthat the evidence presented at trial supported this theory, and that,\\n\\naccordingly, the court’s instruction on “theft” was authorized\\n\\nbecause it encompassed burglary and robbery, which are felonies.\\n\\n                                  6\\n See Smith v. State, \\n290 Ga. 768\\n, 771-772 (2) (\\n723 SE2d 915\\n) (2012);\\n\\nsee also OCGA §§ 16-8-40 (defining robbery as a felony) and 16-7-1\\n\\n(defining burglary as a felony).\\n\\n     Everett, however, argues that the instruction, as given, could\\n\\nhave misled the jury into believing that he was not entitled to a\\n\\njustification defense if he was attempting to commit, was in the act\\n\\nof committing, or fleeing following the commission of any theft,\\n\\nincluding thefts which are misdemeanors, at the time he committed\\n\\nthe act he claims was justified. Although Everett does not explain\\n\\nhis argument further, the only way instructional error here could\\n\\nhave contributed to the verdict is if reasonable jurors could have\\n\\nviewed the evidence as supporting the conclusion that Everett would\\n\\nhave been justified in shooting Nelson, but that he used deadly force\\n\\nwhile committing an undefined “theft” that was not a felony.\\n\\nHowever, Everett does not specify what theft or thefts would have\\n\\nqualified as misdemeanors under the facts of this case.\\n\\n     Nonetheless, even assuming, without deciding, that the charge\\n\\nwas erroneous because the jury was not explicitly instructed that\\n\\n                                   7\\n the exception to a justification defense applied only to actions that\\n\\nconstituted a felony, we conclude that any such error was harmless\\n\\nin light of the evidence presented in this case. As we have explained\\n\\nbefore, “[e]ven when we find error in a jury charge, we will not\\n\\nreverse when the error is harmless, that is, when it is highly\\n\\nprobable that the instruction did not contribute to the verdict.”\\n\\nJones v. State, \\n302 Ga. 892\\n, 897 (3) (\\n810 SE2d 140\\n) (2018) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). To determine whether an instructional\\n\\nerror was harmless, “we assess it in the context of the instructions\\n\\nas a whole.” See Jones v. State, \\n316 Ga. 481\\n, 486 (2) (\\n888 SE2d 91\\n)\\n\\n(2023). Additionally, as with other trial court errors, in assessing\\n\\nharm, “we review the record de novo, and we weigh the evidence as\\n\\nwe would expect reasonable jurors to have done so.” Middleton v.\\n\\nState, \\n310 Ga. 365\\n, 370 (3) (\\n850 SE2d 126\\n) (2020) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     Under these standards, the alleged instructional error here\\n\\nwas harmless. First, the trial court thoroughly instructed the jury\\n\\non justification, correctly explaining that it could find that Everett\\n\\nwas justified in using deadly force only if he\\n\\n                                  8\\n      reasonably believe[d] that such threat or force [was]\\n     necessary to defend himself against the other’s imminent\\n     use of unlawful force. A person is justified in using force\\n     that is intended to or likely to cause death or great bodily\\n     injury only if that person reasonably believes that such\\n     force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury\\n     to himself or to prevent the commission of a forcible\\n     felony.\\n\\nSee OCGA § 16-3-21 (a). The trial court also instructed the jury on\\n\\nthe State’s burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the\\n\\nkilling was not justified. It was only after the court gave these\\n\\ngeneral instructions on justification that it then explained the\\n\\nexception under which the defense would not apply, to which Everett\\n\\nobjects.\\n\\n     As we noted above, the only testimony supporting Everett’s\\n\\njustification defense was his own testimony. But the evidence\\n\\npresented significantly undermined his credibility and showed that\\n\\nhis version of events was untenable. It was undisputed that he shot\\n\\nNelson three times in two different locations in Nelson’s home and\\n\\nthat Nelson was unarmed when at least the last shot was fired.\\n\\nPolice also found Nelson’s house and car keys in Everett’s pockets,\\n\\n\\n                                  9\\n and Nelson’s television, the firearm used in the shooting, and bloody\\n\\ngloves discarded near where Everett was arrested. Additionally, no\\n\\ngunshot residue was found on Everett’s hands, corroborating the\\n\\nState’s theory that Everett was wearing gloves when he shot Nelson,\\n\\nand contradicting Everett’s testimony. And police apprehended\\n\\nEverett near the scene as he was trying to flee, which the jury was\\n\\nauthorized to view as consciousness of guilt.\\n\\n     Taking all of these circumstances together, we are not\\n\\npersuaded that there was a meaningful likelihood that the jury\\n\\nwould have found Everett to be justified independent of any\\n\\nexceptions to the availability of the defense. Because a jury would\\n\\nhave had to find Everett justified before it could consider the\\n\\nexception to that defense, it is highly probable that the instruction\\n\\nhe claims to be erroneous did not contribute to the verdict.\\n\\nAccordingly, any error in instructing the jury was harmless. See,\\n\\ne.g., Jones, \\n302 Ga. at 898\\n (3) (no reversible error where the evidence\\n\\nof the defendant’s guilt was “very strong” and, thus, it was not\\n\\nprobable that the instruction contributed to the verdict); Mullins v.\\n\\n                                  10\\n State, \\n299 Ga. 681\\n, 690 (4) (\\n791 SE2d 828\\n) (2016) (concluding that\\n\\ntrial court erroneously instructed jury regarding inapplicable\\n\\nexception to justification defense but identifying no reversible error\\n\\nwhere “the undisputed evidence [showed] that the victim was\\n\\nunarmed when appellant shot him” and “the trial court fully charged\\n\\nthe jury on the defense of self and the defense of habitation”).\\n\\nEverett’s claim therefore fails.4\\n\\n     3. Everett next argues that trial counsel provided ineffective\\n\\nassistance by failing to object to the State’s use of his prior\\n\\nconvictions as impeachment evidence, thereby failing to preserve\\n\\nthe issue for appellate review. Because the record shows that trial\\n\\ncounsel in fact objected and properly preserved the issue for appeal,\\n\\nthis claim fails.\\n\\n     To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance, Everett\\n\\n\\n     4 In his brief, Everett purported to enumerate as error a second instance\\n\\nof alleged trial court error, namely that the trial court erred in admitting\\nevidence of his prior convictions. However, Everett failed to support this\\nparticular assertion with any argument or citation to legal authority in his\\nbrief. Accordingly, to the extent he intended to assert this error, it is\\nabandoned. See former Supreme Court Rule 22 (2023). See also Ruffin v. State,\\n283 Ga. 87\\n, 88 (4) (\\n656 SE2d 140\\n) (2008) (deeming abandoned under Rule 22\\nan unsupported claim of error).\\n                                     11\\n      has the burden of proving both that the performance of\\n     his lawyer was professionally deficient and that he was\\n     prejudiced as a result. To prove deficient performance, [an\\n     appellant] must show that his trial counsel acted or failed\\n     to act in an objectively reasonable way, considering all of\\n     the circumstances and in light of prevailing professional\\n     norms. To prove resulting prejudice, [an appellant] must\\n     show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\\n     deficiency, the result of the trial would have been\\n     different. In examining an ineffectiveness claim, a court\\n     need not address both components of the inquiry if the\\n     defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\\n\\nFloyd v. State, \\n307 Ga. 789\\n, 799 (4) (\\n837 SE2d 790\\n) (2020) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). With these principles in mind, we turn to\\n\\nEverett’s claim.\\n\\n     Everett filed two pretrial motions in limine to prevent the use\\n\\nof his five prior convictions as impeachment evidence, arguing that\\n\\nthe crimes did not involve veracity. However, the trial court did not\\n\\nrule on the admissibility of the evidence at the pretrial hearing.\\n\\nRather, after hearing argument on Everett’s motions, the trial court\\n\\nreserved ruling on them until Everett opted to testify at trial. After\\n\\nEverett testified on direct examination but prior to his cross-\\n\\nexamination, counsel renewed her objection to the admission of\\n\\n                                 12\\n evidence of his prior convictions. The trial court sustained the\\n\\nobjection as to two convictions but overruled the objection as to the\\n\\nremaining three: two convictions for retail shoplifting and one for\\n\\nreceipt of stolen property, all felonies. When the State began to\\n\\ncross-examine Everett about his prior convictions, trial counsel\\n\\nobjected once more and asked that the State tender the physical\\n\\ncopies of the indictments before reading from them; the court\\n\\noverruled that objection. After the physical copies of the convictions\\n\\nwere admitted, counsel raised no further objection.\\n\\n     We have previously stated that the “[s]tandard practice in\\n\\nGeorgia has long required a party to make and obtain a ruling on an\\n\\nobjection to evidence in the trial court, before or as the evidence is\\n\\nadmitted, in order to preserve the objection for appeal[.]” Whitehead\\n\\nv. State, \\n287 Ga. 242\\n, 246 (2) (\\n695 SE2d 255\\n) (2010). Everett’s\\n\\ncounsel did so here, and “[t]he trial court ha[d] been apprised of the\\n\\npossible error in admitting the evidence and ha[d] made its ruling,\\n\\nand the record ha[d] been perfected for appeal purposes.” \\nId.\\n at 247\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 13\\n (2). There was no reason to make another objection.5 See Simpson v.\\n\\nState, \\n277 Ga. 356\\n, 357 (2) (\\n589 SE2d 90\\n) (2003) (noting that\\n\\nrequiring a second objection would be “superfluous because the trial\\n\\ncourt has been apprised of the possible error in admitting the\\n\\nevidence and has made its ruling,” and additional objection “may\\n\\nfurther highlight the inflammatory evidence, as well as unduly\\n\\nburden the trial court, which has already ruled on the issue”\\n\\n(cleaned up)). Compare Watson v. State, \\n278 Ga. 763\\n, 767 (2) (b) (\\n604\\n\\nSE2d 804\\n) (2004) (holding that an issue was not adequately\\n\\npreserved where defendant filed a motion in limine, trial court did\\n\\nnot issue a pretrial ruling, and defendant did not object until after\\n\\nthe problematic testimony had concluded), overruled on other\\n\\ngrounds, State v. Lane, \\n308 Ga. 10\\n (\\n838 SE2d 808\\n) (2020).\\n\\nAccordingly, trial counsel in fact properly objected to the admission\\n\\nof evidence of Everett’s prior convictions and thereby preserved the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 Because this case was tried in 2010, the former Evidence Code applies.\\n\\nHowever, the rule is the same under the current Evidence Code. See OCGA §\\n24-1-103; see also Rashad v. State, ___ Ga. ___ (3) (a) (___ SE2d ___), (\\n2024 WL\\n422781\\n, \\n2024 LEXIS 19\\n) (Case No. S23A0864, decided Feb. 6, 2024).\\n                                      14\\n issue for ordinary appellate review, and Everett’s claim of ineffective\\n\\nassistance fails. See Salvesen v. State, \\n317 Ga. 314\\n, 321 (4) (\\n893\\n\\nSE2d 66\\n) (2023) (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance based on\\n\\npurported failure to preserve errors where trial counsel properly\\n\\npreserved claim by making a timely objection in the trial court).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

The Firm argues the trial court\\n\\nerred by (1) applying a negligence standard to sua sponte impose sanctions under\\n\\nOCGA § 9-15-14 (b); (2) punishing the Firm when there is a lack of evidence to\\n   support sanctions; and (3) imposing an excessive penalty not tailored to the sanctioned\\n\\n  conduct.1 For the following reasons, we reverse.\\n\\n          In January 2012, Barken’s husband was struck and killed by another vehicle\\n\\n  while driving his motorcycle in a reversible lane in Atlanta. Barken proceeded to file\\n\\n  suit against the City of Atlanta and two public works employees: Ann Green, a traffic\\n\\n  systems operator during the time in question, and Kevin Billups, a traffic supervisor.2\\n\\n  Barken asserted the defendants failed to inspect and maintain a traffic signal governing\\n\\n  the flow of traffic in the reversible lane, thus causing or contributing to the accident\\n\\n  that killed her husband. The City’s law department and an outside law firm jointly\\n\\n  represented all three defendants.\\n\\n          During the ensuing discovery process, Barken obtained three service requests\\n\\n  regarding malfunctioning lane lights at the relevant location.

PUGH v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        BETHEL, Justice.\\n\\n       Andre Pugh was convicted of the malice murder of his wife\\n\\nTiffany Jackson-Pugh and possession of a firearm during the\\n\\ncommission of a felony. 1 In this appeal, Pugh contends that the trial\\n\\ncourt erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained\\n\\npursuant to a search warrant for his cell phone records, that trial\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 The crimes occurred on November 23, 2014. On February 16, 2016, a\\n\\nFulton County grand jury indicted Pugh and co-indictee Adrian Earl Harley\\nfor malice murder (Count 1), felony murder (Count 2), aggravated assault\\n(Count 3), conspiracy to commit murder (Count 4), and possession of a firearm\\nduring the commission of a felony (Count 5). Pugh was tried alone before a jury\\nfrom September 24 to October 5, 2018, and was found guilty of all counts. The\\ntrial court sentenced Pugh to serve life in prison without the possibility of\\nparole on Count 1 and five years on Count 5, to run consecutively to Count 1.\\nThe remaining counts were vacated or merged. On October 23, 2018, Pugh,\\nthrough new counsel, filed a timely motion for new trial, which he amended on\\nDecember 18, 2020. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion, as\\namended, on April 18, 2023. Pugh thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal.\\nThe case was docketed to this Court’s August 2023 term and submitted for a\\ndecision on the briefs.\\n                                                      1\\n counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a particularity challenge\\n\\nto the same search warrant, and that motion-for-new-trial counsel\\n\\nwas ineffective in various respects. Concluding that these claims are\\n\\nmeritless, we affirm.\\n\\n     1. The evidence presented at Pugh’s trial showed the following.\\n\\nAround 6:00 a.m. on November 23, 2014, Tiffany was shot and killed\\n\\nwhile asleep in her bed at the Pughs’ East Point residence. At 6:05\\n\\na.m., Pugh called his boss to report that someone had broken into\\n\\nhis home. Pugh’s boss drove to Pugh’s home, and when he arrived,\\n\\nPugh indicated that he had not been inside the residence but had\\n\\nnoticed a suspected intrusion upon his return from overnight\\n\\nemployment. At approximately 6:15 a.m., Pugh called 911 and\\n\\ninformed the operator that he was at the residence, the garage door\\n\\nwas open, and a downstairs window was broken. He told the\\n\\noperator that Tiffany had been murdered but again claimed that he\\n\\nhad not been inside the home.\\n\\n     When responding officers arrived, Pugh was outside the home,\\n\\nwaving his arms, and exclaiming, “My kids are in there. She’s not\\n\\n                                  2\\n picking up the phone.” Pugh stated that he received a call from ADT,\\n\\nhis alarm-service provider, alerting of a break-in at the residence.\\n\\nPugh further noted that the garage door and a rear window were\\n\\nopen. Pugh also called a neighbor early that morning while “it was\\n\\nstill dark” to report that someone broke into the house, that “they\\n\\nhurt Tiffany,” and that Pugh thought Tiffany was dead.2\\n\\n      Upon entering the house, officers found Tiffany in bed in the\\n\\nmain-level bedroom; she was bleeding from a gunshot wound to her\\n\\nleft eye, which was “obviously swollen and oozing,” and had no\\n\\npulse. 3 Her crying toddler was sitting on her chest; two older\\n\\nchildren were asleep in an upstairs bedroom. Officers found the\\n\\nbasement door and storm door unlocked, a basement window open\\n\\nwith its screen cut, and the gate to the backyard open; during a\\n\\nsweep of the house, they found nothing else of interest.\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 A precise timeline for this conversation was not clearly established at\\n\\ntrial. But, immediately following the call, the neighbor dressed and walked\\nfrom two doors down to the Pugh residence where he found police already on\\nthe scene.\\n       3 A subsequent autopsy revealed that Tiffany was shot twice, once in the\\n\\nleft eye and once near the left breast; the gunshot wound to the head was\\ndetermined to be the cause of her death.\\n                                      3\\n      That morning, Pugh, whom law enforcement did not yet\\n\\nconsider a suspect in Tiffany’s murder, provided a statement to\\n\\npolice, a video-recording of which was played at trial. According to\\n\\nPugh, he left work around 5:15 a.m., and, sometime between 5:30\\n\\na.m. and 5:50 a.m. while driving home, he missed a call from ADT.\\n\\nPugh returned the call and requested that ADT turn off the alarm\\n\\nso as not to disturb his children. Pugh stated that, upon arriving at\\n\\nhome, he went inside to find the alarm still armed. When he turned\\n\\non a light in Tiffany’s bedroom, he “just saw a body,” but he claimed\\n\\nthat he did not notice any blood and that she appeared to be\\n\\nsleeping. He also claimed that he did not try to wake Tiffany because\\n\\nhe was “scared.” Pugh then went downstairs and found broken glass.\\n\\nPugh stated that he told responding officers that he could not find\\n\\nhis son and that his wife was not moving. When asked why he left\\n\\nhis children inside the home despite signs of an apparent break-in,\\n\\nPugh responded that he did not want to wake the older children and\\n\\nthat he was unable to find his son.\\n\\n     During the interview, Pugh expressly stated that he had only\\n\\n                                 4\\n one cell phone; the next day, however, investigators learned that\\n\\nPugh in fact had a second cell phone. Thereafter, officers secured\\n\\nsearch warrants to obtain the records for both phone numbers from\\n\\nSprint, the cell-service provider, as well as for a tower dump of phone\\n\\nnumbers used on the Sprint cell phone tower near Pugh’s residence\\n\\naround the time of the crime. By cross-referencing phone numbers\\n\\nappearing in the tower dump with those in Pugh’s contact list,\\n\\ninvestigators identified co-indictee Adrian Harley as a person of\\n\\ninterest.4 Data from Pugh’s and Harley’s cell phones showed that\\n\\nboth phones were near the residence just before the murder and that\\n\\nseveral calls were exchanged between the phones.\\n\\n     Investigators also obtained security footage from Pugh’s and a\\n\\nneighbor’s5 residences around the time of the murder, which\\n\\ninvestigators determined occurred at approximately 5:58 a.m. The\\n\\nfootage showed two vehicles on the street and in the cul-de-sac near\\n\\n\\n     4 At the time of the crimes, Pugh worked as a disc jockey at Club Onyx,\\n\\nan adult entertainment club. Harley, Pugh’s long-time friend, was employed\\nas his assistant.\\n      5 The neighbor testified that he lived two houses down from the Pugh\\n\\nresidence.\\n                                    5\\n Pugh’s residence shortly before the murder. One vehicle, which had\\n\\na non-operative driver-side parking light, first passed the neighbor’s\\n\\nresidence at 4:50 a.m., corresponding to Harley’s phone records\\n\\nplacing him in Pugh’s neighborhood at 4:49 a.m. That same vehicle\\n\\npulled into the cul-de-sac about ten minutes before the murder,\\n\\nwhere it remained parked for several minutes. At 5:57 a.m., the\\n\\nvehicle’s headlights flashed, and a second vehicle pulled alongside\\n\\nit. At 5:58 a.m., the vehicle with the non-operative parking light\\n\\nmoved forward and stopped in front of Pugh’s house for two or three\\n\\nminutes; the other vehicle drove away. Security footage showed that,\\n\\nsoon thereafter, a light came on in the rear of the residence. Also at\\n\\n5:58 a.m., Pugh received a phone call from ADT. Investigators later\\n\\ndetermined that the vehicle with the non-operative parking light\\n\\nmatched the appearance of Harley’s vehicle, which also had a non-\\n\\noperative driver-side parking light.\\n\\n     At trial, the State presented evidence undermining Pugh’s\\n\\nvarious stories about his actions on the morning of Tiffany’s murder.\\n\\nRecords from ADT showed that ADT called Pugh at 5:58 a.m. and\\n\\n                                  6\\n that Pugh returned the call at 6:03 a.m., contradicting Pugh’s claim\\n\\nthat the call regarding the triggered alarm came between 5:30 a.m.\\n\\nand 5:50 a.m. Surveillance footage showed that, upon parking and\\n\\nexiting his vehicle in front of the home, Pugh in fact did not enter\\n\\nthe home in the manner he described and instead waited for the\\n\\npolice outside, despite his fairly detailed statement to the contrary.\\n\\n     The State also presented significant evidence of Pugh and\\n\\nTiffany’s marital difficulties and impending divorce. In September\\n\\n2014, Tiffany consulted a divorce attorney, made plans to move out\\n\\nof the marital residence on December 1, and intended to file for\\n\\ndivorce. According to Pugh’s boss, Pugh was angry with Tiffany for\\n\\nwanting a divorce. Text messages between Pugh and Tiffany\\n\\nreflected discord in the relationship. Five days before the crimes,\\n\\nPugh texted Tiffany, “I won’t let you leave me now or never.” Tiffany\\n\\nresponded that she took the statement “as a threat.” In other text\\n\\nmessages found on Pugh’s phone, Pugh engaged in sexually explicit\\n\\nconversations with multiple women, exchanged sexually explicit\\n\\nphotographs with other women, and stated that he cheated on\\n\\n                                  7\\n Tiffany every time she was out of town. In addition, a co-worker of\\n\\nTiffany’s with whom she had a romantic relationship in the weeks\\n\\nbefore her death testified regarding Pugh’s suspicions about that\\n\\nrelationship. Pugh’s boss testified that Pugh placed a second phone\\n\\nin Tiffany’s vehicle to use as a GPS tracker because Pugh had been\\n\\n“speculating” that Tiffany “was possibly cheating” and that Pugh\\n\\nhad previously sent Harley to the marital residence to lock Tiffany\\n\\nout of the home.\\n\\n     Evidence of Pugh’s financial motive for the murder was also a\\n\\nprominent focus of the State’s case, with text messages showing that\\n\\nPugh would be unable to maintain the marital home following the\\n\\ndivorce. Within 36 hours after Tiffany’s murder, Pugh reported to\\n\\nhis boss that he went to the social security office to “find out how\\n\\nmuch — what he can get for the passing of his wife” and that, “based\\n\\nupon what social security told him, he was going to be able to\\n\\nmaintain paying his mortgage.” And a family friend testified that,\\n\\nbefore Tiffany’s funeral, Pugh sought her help in contacting\\n\\nTiffany’s employer’s benefits provider. Finally, the State presented\\n\\n                                 8\\n testimony regarding Pugh’s unusual conduct and demeanor in the\\n\\nwake of Tiffany’s murder, particularly his general lack of emotion\\n\\nand apparently contrived expressions of grief.\\n\\n     2. On appeal, Pugh challenges the trial court’s denial of his\\n\\nmotion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant\\n\\nfor his cell phone records. As he did below, Pugh argues that the\\n\\nwarrant application failed to establish probable cause to believe that\\n\\nhe had committed a crime or that evidence of such crime would be\\n\\nfound in the phone records. He also asserts for the first time on\\n\\nappeal that the warrant authorized the seizure of items for which\\n\\nthere was no probable cause and, thus, was overbroad. And in a\\n\\nrelated claim, Pugh contends that trial counsel was ineffective for\\n\\nfailing to challenge the warrant on particularity grounds.\\n\\n     (a) The search warrant at issue was obtained by Sergeant Allyn\\n\\nGlover on November 24, 2014, the day after the crimes. The affidavit\\n\\nsubmitted in support of the search warrant application identified\\n\\nthe place to be searched as “Records of Sprint Phone Number\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  9\\n [Ending] -7281,”6 indicated that the search warrant was sought in\\n\\nconnection with the offense of murder, and recited the following\\n\\nfactual basis:\\n\\n     On November 23rd 2014 at approximately 0616 hours,\\n     East Point Police was dispatched to 3782 Lake Haven\\n     Way, East Point, Fulton County, GA in reference to a\\n     trouble unknown call. Prior to their arrival, East Point\\n     Police Communications advised that they had previously\\n     received an alarm call from that location at 0558 hours,\\n     but the alarm was cancelled shortly thereafter.\\n     Communications advised that the resident, Mr. Andre\\n     Pugh would be standing by in front of the residence and\\n     that he noted damage to a rear window. Upon officers\\n     arrival, they were met by Mr. Pugh, who was waving his\\n     arms in the middle of the street continually stating “my\\n     kids are in there! She’s not picking up the phone”.\\n\\n     Officers entered the residence and located a female victim\\n     laying on the bed, on her back, partially covered up by a\\n     blanket with an apparent gunshot wound to the left eye.\\n     A small child was seen straddling the deceased victim.\\n\\n     Mr. Pugh stated that he was not at the residence during\\n     the incident and came home as a result of being notified\\n     by ADT of his house alarm going off. Mr. Pugh later stated\\n     that he missed a phone call from ADT and then returned\\n     their call. Upon arrival to the residence, Mr. Pugh advised\\n     that he looked in on his wife and saw her in the bedroom,\\n     though he didn’t see any blood (though the victim had\\n\\n     6 Though Pugh complains that the affidavit mentions neither the -7281\\n\\nphone number nor Sprint, he overlooks the enlarged, bold heading which reads\\n“Records of Sprint Phone Number [Ending] -7281.”\\n                                    10\\n      visible blood coming from her head). He then looked in on\\n     his kids and then went downstairs to see the broken glass\\n     and then went outside the residence to make phone calls;\\n     thus, leaving his wife and two children inside the\\n     residence.

Under these circumstances, Pugh has abandoned any claim\\nconcerning the validity of the search warrant for the -2985 phone number. See\\nformer Supreme Court Rule 22 (“Any enumerated error not supported by\\nargument or citation of authority in the brief shall be deemed abandoned.”\\n(applicable to Pugh’s brief based on its filing date)). See also Moon v. State, \\n312\\nGa. 31\\n, 57 (4) n.12 (\\n860 SE2d 519\\n) (2021) (deeming abandoned under former\\nRule 22 unsupported argument that search warrant was invalid). We note that\\nPugh concedes that “nothing of evidentiary value was discovered” in the\\nrecords for the -2985 phone number.\\n                                        13\\n dead. She was shot; that’s it. Pugh was outside. They didn’t like the\\n\\nway he was reacting, but that’s it. They had nothing else.” The trial\\n\\ncourt denied the motion, and later entered a written order finding\\n\\nthat the issuing magistrate “had a substantial . . . basis” for finding\\n\\nthat “probable cause existed for each search warrant.” Against this\\n\\nprocedural backdrop, we turn to Pugh’s claims on appeal.8\\n\\n      (b) Pugh first contends that the affidavit for the search warrant\\n\\nfailed to establish probable cause to support the issuance of the\\n\\nwarrant and that the trial court therefore erred by denying his\\n\\nmotion to suppress. We disagree.\\n\\n\\n\\n      8 We note that, in the trial court, the State argued that a good-faith\\n\\nexception to the exclusionary rule should apply to preclude suppression of the\\nevidence seized pursuant to the warrant, though the State also acknowledged\\nthat “Georgia has historically not recognized the good-faith exception.” See\\nGary v. State, \\n262 Ga. 573\\n (\\n422 SE2d 426\\n) (1992) (construing OCGA § 17-5-30\\nto hold that Georgia does not recognize the good-faith exception to the\\nexclusionary rule established in United States v. Leon, \\n468 U. S. 897\\n (104 SCt\\n3405, 82 LE2d 677) (1984)). The State has not reasserted this argument on\\nappeal, nor has it asked this Court to overrule Gary. Cf. State v. Ledbetter, ___\\nGa. ___ (___ SE2d ____) (\\n2024 Ga. LEXIS 58\\n, \\n2024 WL 923930\\n) (Case Nos.\\nS23A0900, S23X0901, decided Mar. 5, 2024) (Peterson, P.

Britton, \\n316\\n\\nGa. 283\\n, 286 (\\n888 SE2d 157\\n) (2023) (citations and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). Whether there is probable cause to issue a search warrant\\n\\nis a question directed in the first instance to the magistrate. And in\\n\\nassessing whether probable cause exists, the magistrate simply\\n\\nmust make “a practical, common-sense decision,” based on “all the\\n\\ncircumstances set forth in the affidavit before him,” whether there\\n\\nis “a fair probability” that the particular place to be searched\\n\\ncontains the items to be seized — that is, evidence of a crime.\\n\\nCopeland v. State, \\n314 Ga. 44\\n, 49 (3) (\\n875 SE2d 636\\n) (2022) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Probable cause is “not a high bar,” District of Columbia v.\\n\\nWesby, \\n583 U. S. 48\\n, 57 (III) (A) (138 SCt 577, 199 LE2d 453) (2018)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted); it requires merely a fair\\n\\n                                 15\\n probability — “less than a certainty but more than a mere suspicion\\n\\nof possibility — which by no means is to be equated with proof by\\n\\neven so much as a preponderance of the evidence,” Copeland, 314\\n\\nGa. at 49 (3) (citation and punctuation omitted). Thus, our duty as a\\n\\nreviewing court is to determine “whether the magistrate had a\\n\\nsubstantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed to issue\\n\\nthe search warrant.” Glenn v. State, \\n302 Ga. 276\\n, 281 (III) (\\n806 SE2d\\n\\n564\\n) (2017). And we bear in mind that a magistrate’s decision to\\n\\nissue a search warrant upon a finding of probable cause is afforded\\n\\n“substantial deference,” and “[e]ven doubtful cases should be\\n\\nresolved in favor of upholding a magistrate’s determination that a\\n\\nwarrant is proper.” \\nId.\\n (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Pugh says the facts in the affidavit are lacking and fail to show\\n\\nthat evidence of a crime would be found in his phone records. In\\n\\nPugh’s view, the facts in the affidavit do not tie the phone records to\\n\\nthe investigation of Tiffany’s murder and do not connect the -7281\\n\\nphone number to Pugh or to the phone he possessed at the time of\\n\\nthe murder. Pugh is correct that the affidavit does not expressly tie\\n\\n                                  16\\n the phone records to the murder investigation or connect the target\\n\\nphone number to Pugh, but that does not necessarily defeat a finding\\n\\nof probable cause. We judge the affidavit supporting a search\\n\\nwarrant “on the adequacy of what it does contain, not on what it\\n\\nlacks, or on what a critic might say should have been added.” United\\n\\nStates v. Allen, 211 F3d 970, 975 (III) (6th Cir. 2000). Thus, in\\n\\nassessing probable cause, we take reasonable inferences into\\n\\naccount. See Britton, 316 Ga. at 286 (1). Considering the totality of\\n\\nthe circumstances outlined in the affidavit, the magistrate was\\n\\nauthorized to make “certain common-sense conclusions about\\n\\nhuman behavior,” Illinois v. Gates, \\n462 U. S. 213\\n, 231 (III) (103 SCt\\n\\n2317, 76 LE2d 527) (1982), and infer that Pugh was somehow\\n\\ninvolved in Tiffany’s murder, that evidence of his location and\\n\\ncommunications in the time surrounding the murder might be found\\n\\nin his cell phone records, and that the target phone number belonged\\n\\nto Pugh. See State v. Ledbetter, ___ Ga. ___ (2) (___ SE2d ____) (\\n2024\\n\\nWL 923930\\n, \\n2024 Ga. LEXIS 58\\n) (Case Nos. S23A0900, S23X0901,\\n\\ndecided Mar. 5, 2024); Taylor v. State, \\n303 Ga. 57\\n, 61 (2) (\\n810 SE2d\\n\\n17\\n\\n 113) (2018).\\n\\n     Here, the affidavit provided facts about Tiffany and her\\n\\nconnection to Pugh, including that she and Pugh were married, that\\n\\nthey had children, and that the family resided together. The\\n\\naffidavit also described Pugh’s conduct and his interactions with\\n\\npolice, including what could be viewed as the very unusual decision,\\n\\nmade under the purported belief that an intruder had broken into\\n\\nhis home, to leave his sleeping wife and children in the home while\\n\\nhe waited outside. As detailed in the affidavit, Pugh’s behavior was\\n\\nflatly inconsistent with his frantic cries to the first responding\\n\\nofficers about his kids being in the home and Tiffany not answering\\n\\nher phone. Further, Pugh’s own account of returning home and his\\n\\nclaim that he did not notice Tiffany bleeding was contradicted by\\n\\nphysical evidence at the scene. And while a window of the residence\\n\\nwas damaged, the fact that the sounding alarm was quickly\\n\\ndeactivated indicated that whoever entered the residence, and\\n\\npresumably killed Tiffany, had knowledge of the alarm code. Taken\\n\\ntogether, Pugh’s implausible behavior, his relationship with the\\n\\n                                18\\n victim and connection to the residence where the crime occurred, the\\n\\ninconsistency between his statement and the evidence at the scene,\\n\\nand evidence suggesting that the crime was committed by someone\\n\\nfamiliar with the residence’s alarm code showed a fair probability\\n\\nthat Pugh was involved in Tiffany’s murder. See Wesby, 583 U. S. at\\n\\n59 (III) (A) (“Based on the vagueness and implausibility of the\\n\\n[suspects’] stories, the officers could have reasonably inferred that\\n\\nthey were lying and that their lies suggested a guilty mind.”); United\\n\\nStates v. Ameling, 328 F3d 443, 449 (8th Cir. 2003) (A suspect’s\\n\\n“apparently false statements and inconsistent stories,” in the\\n\\ntotality of the circumstances, can provide probable cause that he was\\n\\n“involved in criminal conduct.”).\\n\\n     Not only did the affidavit support the inference that Pugh had\\n\\nsome involvement in Tiffany’s murder, it also offered a substantial\\n\\nbasis for the magistrate to conclude that a fair probability existed\\n\\nthat Pugh’s cell phone records would contain evidence of the crime.\\n\\nThe facts in the affidavit indicated that Pugh was using his cell\\n\\nphone around the time of the murder—he reported missing the\\n\\n                                    19\\n initial call from ADT, he indicated to police that he had attempted\\n\\nto call Tiffany but that she failed to answer, and he said he made\\n\\nphone calls while waiting on police to respond to the residence. From\\n\\nthese facts, the magistrate could reasonably infer that Pugh’s cell\\n\\nphone records would contain information about his communications\\n\\nand whereabouts around the time of the crime, which, logically,\\n\\ncould provide evidence of his involvement in Tiffany’s murder.\\n\\nIndeed, Sergeant Glover averred as much; after detailing his\\n\\nexperience and training and Pugh’s conduct at the scene, including\\n\\nmaking several phone calls, he indicated his belief that “this phone”\\n\\nwould contain evidence related to the crime,9 including “but not\\n\\n\\n\\n      9 Pugh takes issue with this statement, arguing that “[m]ere belief or\\n\\nsuspicion is never enough to support a search warrant.” But the affidavit at\\nissue here is not remotely comparable to the bare-bones affidavits entirely\\ndevoid of facts that were found insufficient in the cases upon which Pugh relies.\\nSpecifically, Pugh points to Nathanson v. United States, \\n290 U. S. 41\\n, 44, 47\\n(54 SCt 11, 78 LE 159) (1933) (holding insufficient affidavit which stated only\\nthat the affiant “has cause to suspect and does believe” that “[c]ertain liquors\\nof foreign origin” illegally brought into the United States were located at a\\nparticular premises); Smoot v. State, \\n160 Ga. 744\\n, 746-747 (\\n128 SE 909\\n) (1925)\\n(“The affidavit is based only upon the statements of the affiant that ‘he has\\nreason to believe that a quantity of intoxicating liquor is in the dwelling-house\\nof [appellant], and verily believes upon probable cause that the intoxicating\\nliquor is kept in violation of the laws of the State of Georgia.’ . . . [I]t\\n\\n                                       20\\n limited to GPS data, call logs, texts, etc.” See United States v. Floyd,\\n\\n740 F3d 22, 35 (II) (B) (3) (1st Cir. 2014) (“[A] law enforcement\\n\\nofficer’s training and experience may yield insights that support a\\n\\nprobable cause determination.”).\\n\\n      Though Pugh complains that the -7281 phone number was not\\n\\nexplicitly connected to him or to the phone he possessed at the time\\n\\nof the murder, this argument fails. As we recently explained in\\n\\nrejecting a similar claim in Ledbetter, at *27 (2) (a) (i), the absence\\n\\nof an express connection, “by itself, is not a fatal flaw” and, as with\\n\\nother questions of probable cause, requires the reviewing court to\\n\\nconsider “all the circumstances” presented in the affidavit to\\n\\ndetermine whether the magistrate could have inferred the necessary\\n\\n\\n\\nis apparent from the affidavit that no fact which would have afforded the basis\\nfor a legal conclusion of probable cause was before the court[.]” (punctuation\\nomitted)); and Johnson v. State, \\n111 Ga. App. 298\\n, 305 (1) (c) (1965) (“Certainly,\\nsince no facts of any kind were stated in the affidavit, it was deficient in this\\nrespect. . . . Does the recital in the warrant, ‘evidence having been submitted\\nto me to show probable cause,’ meet the requirement? . . . Obviously not.”).\\nPugh’s complaint that Sergeant Glover believed evidence would be found on\\n“this phone,” rather than phone records, is also unavailing, as such\\n“hypertechnical” assessments have no place in the test for probable cause. See\\nGates, \\n462 U. S. at 236\\n (III) (“[C]ourts should not invalidate warrants by\\ninterpreting affidavits in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense,\\nmanner.” (citations and punctuation omitted)).\\n                                       21\\n link. Here, as in Ledbetter, the affidavit indicated that law\\n\\nenforcement had an opportunity to learn Pugh’s phone number by\\n\\nnoting that Pugh made multiple statements to police regarding his\\n\\nphone use around the time of the crime. See Ledbetter, at *36-37 (b)\\n\\n(i). Pugh’s was the only name mentioned in the affidavit, he was the\\n\\nfocus of the affidavit’s narrative, and only one phone number was\\n\\nreferenced in the affidavit. See Taylor, 303 Ga. at 61 (2) (rejecting\\n\\nargument that warrant was not supported by probable cause for\\n\\nfailure to expressly state that address to be searched was appellant’s\\n\\naddress because, in light of other information in the affidavit, “the\\n\\nmagistrate, making a practical and common-sense decision, was\\n\\nentitled to infer that there was a ‘fair probability’ that [appellant]\\n\\nlived at” the target address); United States v. Hunter, 863 F3d 679,\\n\\n682 (I) (7th Cir. 1996) (although affidavit did not explicitly state that\\n\\naddress to be searched was appellant’s residence, “that is the only\\n\\nlogical conclusion supported by a common-sense reading of the\\n\\naffidavit,” which “referred four times to [appellant’s] residence” and\\n\\n“made no reference to any other place connected to [appellant]”).\\n\\n                                   22\\n Moreover, “[t]here was nothing in the affidavit . . . to lead the\\n\\nmagistrate to believe that the . . . phone number[ ] [was] associated\\n\\nwith” anyone other than Pugh. Ledbetter, at *29 (2) (a). While it\\n\\nwould have been helpful to include the fact that Pugh used the -7281\\n\\nphone number, see Ledbetter, at *31 and n.24 (2) (a) (i) (noting that\\n\\n“argument on this point would have been more easily resolved if the\\n\\ndrafter of the warrant had taken the small, but important, extra\\n\\nstep of expressly linking” the target phone number to the user and\\n\\n“encourag[ing] law enforcement to provide such information on the\\n\\nface of the warrant application or affidavit”), we conclude, in light of\\n\\nall the circumstances, that the affidavit nevertheless provided the\\n\\nissuing magistrate with sufficient information from which the\\n\\nmagistrate could reasonably infer that the -7281 phone number\\n\\nbelonged to Pugh. For all these reasons, we conclude that the\\n\\nmagistrate had a substantial basis for finding that probable cause\\n\\nexisted to issue the search warrant, and this claim fails.\\n\\n     (c) Pugh next asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the\\n\\naffidavit failed to establish probable cause to search for and seize\\n\\n                                  23\\n certain categories of evidence specified in the search warrant.\\n\\nBecause Pugh did not challenge the warrant on this basis in the trial\\n\\ncourt, we review only for plain error. See Williams v. State, \\n315 Ga.\\n\\n490\\n, 494-495 (2) (\\n883 SE2d 733\\n) (2023) (applying plain-error review\\n\\nto particularity challenge to search warrant where appellant did not\\n\\nmove to suppress evidence procured by the warrant on that basis in\\n\\nthe trial court). To establish plain error, Pugh must demonstrate\\n\\nthat the alleged error was not “affirmatively waived”; was “clear or\\n\\nobvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute”; “affected his\\n\\nsubstantial rights,” meaning that “it affected the outcome of the trial\\n\\ncourt proceedings”; and “seriously affects the fairness, integrity[,] or\\n\\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.” Hampton v. State, \\n302 Ga.\\n\\n166\\n, 167 (2) (\\n805 SE2d 902\\n) (2017) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). “Satisfying all four prongs of this standard is difficult, as\\n\\nit should be.” \\nId. at 168\\n (2) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Pugh contends that the scope of the items to be seized under\\n\\nthe warrant “exceed[ed] the facts justifying” the warrant’s issuance.\\n\\nThe thrust of Pugh’s argument, as we understand it, is not that the\\n\\n                                  24\\n warrant was an unconstitutional general warrant but that it\\n\\ncontained some overly broad provisions that authorized the seizure\\n\\nof items for which there was no probable cause.\\n\\n     The Fourth Amendment, besides requiring probable cause to\\n\\nissue a search warrant, requires “probable cause to seize the\\n\\nparticular things named in the warrant.” United States v. Sanjar,\\n\\n876 F3d 725, 735 (II) (5th Cir. 2017); see Reaves v. State, \\n284 Ga.\\n\\n236\\n, 237 (1) (b) (\\n664 SE2d 207\\n) (2008) (“[W]hether probable cause\\n\\nhas been shown for the search for and seizure of the specific items”\\n\\ndescribed in the warrant is “separate from the question” of whether\\n\\nthere is probable cause “to believe that a certain crime has been\\n\\ncommitted and that there is a fair probability that ‘evidence’ of that\\n\\ncrime will be located at the place specified[.]”). If those requirements\\n\\nare not met, an issue of overbreadth may arise. See Ninety-Two\\n\\nThousand Four-Hundred Twenty-Two Dollars & Fifty-Seven Cents,\\n\\n307 F3d at 148-149 (IV) (A). A warrant suffering from overbreadth\\n\\n“describes in both specific and inclusive generic terms what is to be\\n\\nseized, but it authorizes the seizure of items as to which there is no\\n\\n                                  25\\n probable cause.” Id. at 149 (IV) (A) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted); see also United States v. Wilson, 897 F2d 1034, 1039 (10th\\n\\nCir. 1990) (The “breadth of a warrant must be justified by the\\n\\nbreadth of the probable cause[.]” (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)).\\n\\n     Critically, the inclusion of overly broad provisions does not\\n\\nnecessarily doom the warrant in its entirety. See United States v.\\n\\nCotto, 995 F3d 786, 798 (II) (B) (2) (10th Cir. 2021) (“[E]ven if the\\n\\nwarrant at issue here is overbroad, suppression of evidence should\\n\\nbe a last resort, not a first impulse.” (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)). In such cases, the warrant “can be cured by redaction, that\\n\\nis, by striking from the warrant those severable phrases and clauses\\n\\nthat are invalid for lack of probable cause or generality and\\n\\npreserving those severable phrases and clauses that satisfy the\\n\\nFourth Amendment.” Ninety-Two Thousand Four-Hundred Twenty-\\n\\nTwo Dollars & Fifty-Seven Cents, 307 F3d at 149 (IV) (A).\\n\\n     With these principles in mind, we return our focus to Pugh’s\\n\\narguments on appeal. As an initial matter, Pugh does not argue that\\n\\n                                 26\\n a warrant containing some overly broad provisions is necessarily\\n\\nwholly invalid. Nor does it appear that Pugh’s overbreadth challenge\\n\\nconcerns records of his communications and location, and, in fact, he\\n\\nappears to concede that there was probable cause to seize such\\n\\nrecords. Instead, without identifying the specific provisions of the\\n\\nwarrant with which he takes issue,10 he complains that the items to\\n\\nbe seized included “internet browser history, photographs and\\n\\nvideos, documents and text-based files, unread emails, and much,\\n\\nmuch more,” for which he says probable cause was lacking.\\n\\nAssuming without deciding that Pugh is correct that the warrant\\n\\nwas overbroad in the respects he contends, his claim nonetheless\\n\\nfails on the third prong of plain error review because he has not\\n\\n\\n\\n      10 Pugh also notes that the affidavit referenced only “GPS data, call logs,\\n\\nand texts, etc.,” while the warrant authorized the search for and seizure of a\\nwider array of items. To the extent Pugh asserts that probable cause to search\\nfor and seize an item is established only if that item is specifically identified in\\nthe supporting affidavit, he is incorrect. See Groh v. Ramirez, \\n540 U.

Indeed, as far as we can tell—and Pugh does not argue\\n\\notherwise—the only evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant that\\n\\nwas later admitted at trial were records of Pugh’s phone calls and\\n\\ntext messages, as well as cell-site location information. 11 See Cotto,\\n\\n995 F3d at 800 (II) (B) (2) (where warrant contained both valid\\n\\nprovisions and overly broad provision but no evidence was seized\\n\\n\\n\\n     11 Pugh does not argue that the seizure of this evidence led to the\\ndiscovery of other evidence that was admitted against him at trial.\\n                                  28\\n pursuant to overly broad provision, none of the evidence obtained\\n\\nduring the search should have been suppressed); United States v.\\n\\nTimley, 443 F3d 615, 623 (I) (8th Cir. 2006) (although warrant may\\n\\nhave been overbroad in certain respects, any failure to suppress\\n\\nseized evidence was harmless because warrant was sufficient “as to\\n\\nitems seized that formed the basis for the criminal charges”); United\\n\\nStates v.

Further, although Pugh\\n\\nbears the burden of showing harm in the context of plain error\\n\\nreview, see Hampton, \\n302 Ga. at 168\\n (2), it is not readily apparent\\n\\nto us, based on a comprehensive review of the record, what harm\\n\\nPugh suffered as a result of this assumed error. For all these\\n\\nreasons, we conclude that this claim fails.\\n\\n     (d) In his final enumeration of error concerning the search\\n\\nwarrant, Pugh contends that the warrant was insufficiently\\n\\nparticularized such that it constituted a general warrant and that\\n\\n                                 29\\n trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this claim below. For\\n\\nthe reasons explained below, we cannot agree.\\n\\n     The Fourth Amendment requires a warrant to “particularly”\\n\\ndescribe “the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\\n\\nseized.” The particularity requirement guards against the “specific\\n\\nevil” of the “general warrant,” which was “abhorred by the colonists”\\n\\nand permitted “a general, exploratory rummaging in a person’s\\n\\nbelongings.” Coolidge v. New Hampshire, \\n403 U. S. 443\\n, 467 (II) (C)\\n\\n(91 SCt 2022, 29 LE2d 564) (1971) (punctuation omitted). Pugh\\n\\nraises his particularity challenge through the lens of ineffective\\n\\nassistance of counsel. To succeed on this claim, Pugh bears the\\n\\nburden of showing both that trial counsel’s performance was\\n\\ndeficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result. See Strickland\\n\\nv. Washington, \\n466 U. S. 668\\n, 687 (III) (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674)\\n\\n(1984). To establish deficient performance, Pugh must show that his\\n\\ntrial counsel performed his duties in an objectively unreasonable\\n\\nway. See \\nid. at 687-690\\n (III) (B). To “eliminate the distorting effects\\n\\nof hindsight,” we must consider Pugh’s claim in light of “counsel’s\\n\\n                                  30\\n perspective at the time” and “indulge a strong presumption” that\\n\\ncounsel’s performance was reasonable. \\nId. at 689\\n (III) (B). Pugh\\n\\n“bears the burden of overcoming this presumption” by “show[ing]\\n\\nthat no reasonable lawyer would have done what his lawyer did, or\\n\\nwould have failed to do what his lawyer did not.” Hurston v. State,\\n\\n310 Ga. 818\\n, 825 (3) (\\n854 SE2d 745\\n) (2021) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). To establish prejudice, Pugh must show a reasonable\\n\\nprobability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance, the result\\n\\nat trial would have been different. See id. at 694 (III) (B).\\n\\n     In addition, “[w]here, as here, an appellant claims that trial\\n\\ncounsel was deficient for failing to file a motion to suppress, the\\n\\nappellant must make a strong showing that the damaging evidence\\n\\nwould have been suppressed had counsel made the motion.” Tabor\\n\\nv. State, \\n315 Ga. 240\\n, 249 (3) (b) (\\n882 SE2d 329\\n) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). See also Evans v. State, \\n306 Ga. 403\\n, 509 (2)\\n\\n(a) (\\n831 SE2d 818\\n) (2019) (“[T]rial counsel cannot be deficient for\\n\\nfailing to file a meritless motion[.]”). In determining whether an\\n\\nappellant has carried his burden of making this showing, we ask\\n\\n                                  31\\n whether a motion to suppress on the specific basis proposed by the\\n\\nappellant would “clearly have succeeded” had his trial counsel raised\\n\\nit. Ward v. State, \\n313 Ga. 265\\n, 275 (4) (b) (\\n869 SE2d 470\\n) (2022); see\\n\\nalso Reese v. State, \\n317 Ga. 189\\n, 201-202 (4) (\\n891 SE2d 835\\n) (2023).\\n\\nAlso relevant to our analysis is whether appellant’s argument was\\n\\nsupported by binding appellate precedent at the time of trial. See\\n\\nHurston, 310 Ga. at 829 (3) (b); Esprit v. State, \\n305 Ga. 429\\n, 438 (\\n826\\n\\nSE2d 7\\n) (2019) (“A criminal defense attorney does not perform\\n\\ndeficiently when he fails to advance a legal theory that would\\n\\nrequire an extension of existing precedents and the adoption of an\\n\\nunproven theory of law.” (citation and punctuation omitted)). We\\n\\nconclude that Pugh has failed to make the required strong showing.\\n\\n     The substantive predicate of Pugh’s claim appears to be that\\n\\nthe warrant at issue here is analogous to the warrant we recently\\n\\nconcluded was an invalid general warrant in State v. Wilson, \\n315\\n\\nGa. 613\\n (\\n884 SE2d 298\\n) (2023) (decided Feb. 21, 2023). In that case,\\n\\nwe addressed a particularity challenge to a warrant that authorized\\n\\na “forensic examination” of a cell phone for “any and all stored\\n\\n                                  32\\n electronic information, including but not limited to” various\\n\\ncategories of electronic data. Id. at 613-614. Noting the warrant’s\\n\\n“complete absence of limiting language,” we agreed with the trial\\n\\ncourt that the warrant “authorized an impermissible general search\\n\\nof [the appellant’s] cell phones” and, thus, affirmed the trial court’s\\n\\nruling suppressing evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. Id.\\n\\nat 615-616. Pugh sees similarities between the warrant we held\\n\\ninvalid in Wilson and the warrant at issue in this case, which he\\n\\ncharacterizes as “an illegal general warrant.” Pugh says that, like in\\n\\nWilson, the warrant in this case “essentially” permitted “an\\n\\nunlimited general search of information and records relating to the\\n\\n[target] phone number” and “authorize[d] the broadest possible\\n\\nsearch of the phone records for the most general categories of data\\n\\nimaginable.”12 Pugh’s claim thus turns on our decision in Wilson and\\n\\nhis assertion that the warrant in this case is as obviously general in\\n\\nnature as the warrant in Wilson.\\n\\n\\n\\n     12 Pugh does not argue that officers in fact conducted an unconstitutional\\n\\ngeneral search.\\n                                     33\\n      As an initial matter, however, Wilson was decided more than\\n\\nfour years after Pugh’s 2018 trial, so his trial counsel would not have\\n\\nbeen able to rely on Wilson in challenging the warrant’s compliance\\n\\nwith the particularity requirement. See Hurston, 310 Ga. at 829 (3)\\n\\n(b). Although Wilson does not represent a change in the law on\\n\\nparticularity, see Wilson, 315 Ga. at 616 (noting that “well-\\n\\nestablished legal precedent supports our conclusion that the trial\\n\\ncourt properly suppressed the cell phone evidence”), it is the first\\n\\ndecision in which this Court applied the particularity requirement\\n\\nto invalidate a warrant that authorized a search of the entirety of\\n\\nelectronic data contained on a cell phone and, thus, reflects an\\n\\nextension of existing precedent. And as we have explained before,\\n\\n     when addressing a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel, the\\n     reasonableness of counsel’s conduct is examined from\\n     counsel’s perspective at the time of trial. Thus, a new\\n     decision does not apply in a manner that would require\\n     counsel to argue beyond existing precedent and anticipate\\n     the substance of the opinion before it was issued.\\n\\nWalker v. State, \\n306 Ga. 579\\n, 583 (2) (b) (\\n832 SE2d 420\\n) (2019)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted). Trial counsel therefore cannot\\n\\n\\n                                  34\\n “be deemed ineffective for failing to argue precedent that was not in\\n\\nexistence at the time of [the] trial.” \\nId.\\n\\n\\n      Moreover, Pugh has not clearly shown, through his nearly\\n\\nsingular reliance on Wilson,13 that a motion to suppress on the basis\\n\\nargued would have succeeded and, thus, has failed to make the\\n\\nrequired “strong showing that the damaging evidence would have\\n\\nbeen suppressed.” Reese, 317 Ga. at 201 (4) (a). Whereas the warrant\\n\\nwe considered in Wilson was, on its face, a general warrant—it\\n\\nexpressly authorized the seizure, without limitation, of “any and all\\n\\nstored electronic information,” Wilson, 315 Ga. at 613—the warrant\\n\\nhere appears to be of a different character. Indeed, this warrant “did\\n\\nnot simply provide an unbounded description authorizing the search\\n\\nand seizure of any and all data on the cell phone,” Perez v. State, \\n316\\n\\nGa. 433\\n, 447 (3) (\\n888 SE2d 526\\n) (2023), but, rather, identified 18\\n\\nseparate categories of items, many of which appear to be sufficiently\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      13 In support of his claim of ineffective assistance, Pugh cites only Wilson\\n\\nand one other decision of this Court, both of which were issued after his trial.\\nHe also cites a decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which also\\nwas issued after his trial and, of course, is not binding on this Court.\\n                                       35\\n particularized, while others appear significantly broader in scope.\\n\\nFurther, unlike the warrant in Wilson and its “complete absence of\\n\\nlimiting language,” Wilson, 315 Ga. at 615, certain categories of the\\n\\nwarrant in this case are limited by time or by reference to the\\n\\nspecific crime under investigation, and additional categories appear\\n\\nto be directed not toward facilitating a limitless search of Pugh’s cell\\n\\nphone but to obtaining business-type records from Sprint. In sum,\\n\\ntaken as a whole, the warrant in this case is not as easily read as\\n\\nthe warrant in Wilson as authorizing the seizure of all data without\\n\\nlimitation on the target cell phone.\\n\\n     To be sure, certain portions of this warrant paint a broad stroke\\n\\nand raise questions about the sort of particularity required in\\n\\nwarrants for the seizure of data contained on cell phones and of\\n\\nrecords held by cell-service providers. But it does not appear to us\\n\\nthat Wilson alone can resolve these questions, and Pugh otherwise\\n\\nmakes no effort to grapple with them. Nor does Pugh cite, and we\\n\\nhave not found, any United States Supreme Court or Georgia\\n\\nappellate precedent that clearly held, at the time of Pugh’s trial, that\\n\\n                                  36\\n a search warrant authorizing the seizure of a wide range of data\\n\\nfrom a defendant’s cell phone and cell-service provider amounts to a\\n\\ngeneral warrant under these circumstances. See Hourin v. State,\\n\\n301 Ga. 835\\n, 844 (3) (b) (\\n804 SE2d 388\\n) (2017) (“In evaluating the\\n\\nparticularity of a warrant’s description, we must determine whether\\n\\nthe description is sufficient to enable a prudent officer executing the\\n\\nwarrant to locate it definitely and with reasonable certainty. The\\n\\ndegree of the description’s specificity is flexible and will vary with\\n\\nthe circumstances involved.” (emphasis supplied; citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)). In short, whether this warrant constitutes a\\n\\ngeneral warrant presents a difficult question, and it is not apparent\\n\\nto us that there is an obvious answer. We thus conclude that a\\n\\nmotion to suppress “on the ground now proposed” by Pugh “would\\n\\nnot clearly have succeeded,” and his trial counsel was not deficient\\n\\n“in failing to make such a motion.” Ward, 313 Ga. at 275 (4) (b); see\\n\\nalso Reese, 317 Ga. at 201-202 (4) (a) (in the context of a different\\n\\nlegal question that presented a similarly difficult legal analysis on\\n\\nthe merits, identifying no deficient performance where appellant\\n\\n                                  37\\n failed to “clearly show” that a motion to suppress based on his\\n\\nproposed argument would have been successful). Compare Bryant v.\\n\\nState, \\n301 Ga. 617\\n, 620 (2) (\\n800 SE2d 537\\n) (2017) (concluding that\\n\\ntrial counsel was deficient for failing to raise particularity challenge\\n\\nto search warrant that “did not describe the items to be seized at all”\\n\\n(emphasis in original; citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n      3. Finally, Pugh asserts that motion-for-new-trial counsel was\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective by failing to raise four claims of trial\\n\\ncounsel’s ineffectiveness. But these claims, which “simply recast his\\n\\ntrial-counsel    ineffectiveness      claims     as    motion-for-new-trial\\n\\nineffectiveness claims,” are procedurally barred.14 See Robinson v.\\n\\nState, \\n306 Ga. 614\\n, 616 (2) (b) (\\n832 SE2d 411\\n) (2019). This Court has\\n\\n      consistently held that a defendant cannot resuscitate a\\n      specific claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel that\\n      was not raised at the motion for new trial stage by\\n      recasting the claim on appeal as one of ineffective\\n\\n      14 In one claim, Pugh ostensibly challenges the manner in which motion-\\n\\nfor-new-trial counsel pursued a “properly raised” claim of trial counsel\\nineffectiveness concerning the motion to suppress cell phone records, but the\\ncrux of Pugh’s argument on appeal is that motion-for-new-trial counsel should\\nhave raised an additional or alternative claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness\\nwith respect to the motion to suppress. Accordingly, this, like Pugh’s other\\nclaims of motion-for-new-trial ineffectiveness, is simply another attempt at\\nimproper bootstrapping.\\n                                      38\\n       assistance of motion-for-new-trial counsel for failing to\\n      raise the specific claim of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness.\\n\\nId. at 617 (2) (b) (citation and punctuation omitted). See also Elkins\\n\\nv. State, \\n306 Ga. 351\\n, 362 (4) (b) (\\n830 SE2d 217\\n) (2019); King v. State,\\n\\n304 Ga. 349\\n, 351 (\\n818 SE2d 612\\n) (2018). Accordingly, these claims,\\n\\nlike the others, fail. 15\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      15 If Pugh “wishes to pursue a claim that his post-conviction counsel was\\n\\nineffective[,] he must do so through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.”\\nRobinson, \\n306 Ga. at 617\\n (2) (b) n.5 (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n                                      39\\n      PINSON, J., concurring.\\n\\n     I concur fully in the Court’s opinion. Relevant to Division 2 (d)\\n\\nof that opinion, I want to flag one important point about the Fourth\\n\\nAmendment’s particularity requirement as applied to search\\n\\nwarrants for cell phones, because it’s going to come up again and\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n     In State v. Wilson, \\n315 Ga. 613\\n (\\n884 SE2d 298\\n) (2023), we held\\n\\nthat the search warrant for cell phones in that case violated the\\n\\nFourth Amendment’s requirement that a warrant “particularly”\\n\\ndescribe “the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\\n\\nseized.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. The problem with that warrant was\\n\\nnot merely that it allowed police to search the entire contents of the\\n\\ncell phones. The problem was that the warrant allowed police to\\n\\nsearch the phones, seize every bit of data on them, and use anything\\n\\nthey found against the defendant without regard for whether any of\\n\\nthat data was evidence of the crime the defendant was accused of\\n\\ncommitting. See Wilson, 315 Ga. at 615-616; id. at 624 (Pinson, J.,\\n\\nconcurring). In other words, the warrant on its face authorized the\\n\\n                                 40\\n long forbidden “general search[ ]”: the “exploratory rummaging in a\\n\\nperson’s belongings” for unspecified evidence of unspecified crimes.\\n\\nCoolidge v. New Hampshire, \\n403 U.S. 443\\n, 467 (II) (C) (91 SCt 2022,\\n\\n29 LE2d 564) (1971), holding modified by Horton v. California, \\n496\\n\\nU.S. 128\\n (110 SCt 2301, 110 LE2d 112) (1990); Marron v. United\\n\\nStates, \\n275 U.S. 192\\n, 195 (1) (48 SCt 74, 72 LEd 231) (1927).\\n\\n     So Wilson’s takeaway was not that a search warrant for a cell\\n\\nphone necessarily must list each specific kind or category of data the\\n\\npolice may look through when they search the phone’s contents. Just\\n\\nas specifying the address of a home can be particular enough to allow\\n\\npolice to search rooms, closets, and cabinets throughout the home,\\n\\nidentifying a specific cell phone as the “place to be searched” may\\n\\nwell be particular enough to authorize police to look through the\\n\\ncontents of the phone. See United States v. Ross, \\n456 U.S. 798\\n, 820-\\n\\n821 (IV) (102 SCt 2157, 72 LE2d 572) (1982) (“A lawful search of\\n\\nfixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the\\n\\nobject of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility\\n\\nthat separate acts of entry or opening may be required to complete\\n\\n                                  41\\n the search.”); Peacock v. State, \\n314 Ga. 709\\n, 717 (3) (b) (\\n878 SE2d\\n\\n247\\n) (2022) (noting “it is well settled that a search warrant for a\\n\\nhome authorizes searching . . . containers” like “desks, cabinets,\\n\\nclosets, or ‘any other item of personal property’ in which the items\\n\\ndescribed in the search warrant might be stored” “without\\n\\nseparately identifying them with particularity” (cleaned up)).\\n\\nInstead, the point to take from Wilson is that a search warrant for a\\n\\ncell phone also needs to tell the police, with sufficient particularity,\\n\\nwhat they can look for in their search of the phone. As we indicated\\n\\nin Wilson, the warrant must limit the object of the search to evidence\\n\\nof the crimes that the police have probable cause to believe the\\n\\nsuspect committed. Wilson, \\n315 Ga. 615\\n-616; see id. at 617\\n\\n(Peterson,   P.J.,   concurring)    (explaining    the    particularity\\n\\nrequirement, when met, “means that the warrant allows the officer\\n\\nto identify the object of the search or seizure ‘definitely and with\\n\\nreasonable certainty’”); Westbrook v. State, \\n308 Ga. 92\\n, 97-98 (3) (a)\\n\\n& n.5 (\\n839 SE2d 620\\n) (2020) (holding ineffective claim based on\\n\\nfailure to object to particularity of warrant was meritless because\\n\\n                                   42\\n search warrant “enable[d] a prudent officer to know to look for\\n\\nphotographs and videos” relating to the murder on the cell phone).\\n\\nAnd “evidence of murder” generally is not particular enough,\\n\\nalthough what further specificity is required will depend on the\\n\\nnature of the crimes in question and the circumstances of a\\n\\nparticular case. See, e.g., Groh v. Ramirez, \\n540 U.S. 551\\n, 554-555 (I),\\n\\n557-559 (II) (124 SCt, 157 LE2d 1068) (2004) (warrant was not\\n\\nsufficiently particular when it authorized a search of defendant’s\\n\\nhouse, and was based on probable cause to believe house contained\\n\\nillegal explosive weapons, but did not identify any items to be\\n\\nseized); Bryant v. State, \\n301 Ga. 617\\n, 619-620 (2) & n.3 (\\n800 SE2d\\n\\n537\\n) (2017) (warrant was not sufficiently particular when it\\n\\nauthorized a search of defendant’s house and cars, and stated there\\n\\nwas probable cause to believe he had committed murder, but did not\\n\\nspecifically identify any property, items, articles, or instruments to\\n\\nbe searched for and seized); Dobbins v. State, \\n262 Ga. 161\\n, 163-164\\n\\n(3) (\\n415 SE2d 168\\n) (1992) (warrant was not sufficiently particular\\n\\nwhen it authorized seizure of “certain property and/or materials of\\n\\n                                  43\\n a pornographic nature, to-wit, movies, pictures and magazines\\n\\nwhich are contrary to the laws of the State of Georgia,” because it\\n\\ndid not specify how or why the items were believed to be obscene but\\n\\ninstead left that determination “entirely to the discretion of the\\n\\nofficers executing the warrant”). 16\\n\\n      In short, under Wilson, a search warrant for a cell phone must\\n\\nidentify with sufficient particularity both the cell phone that may be\\n\\nsearched and the object of that search. Anything less will not hold\\n\\nup against a Fourth Amendment challenge.\\n\\n      With this understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.\\n\\n      I am authorized to state that Justice Warren, Justice Bethel,\\n\\nand Justice McMillian join in this concurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      16 Of course, another question lurking here is what police can do with\\n\\nsomething they find on a cell phone while searching for whatever the warrant\\nauthorizes them to search for—that is, whether police can seize and use\\nnonresponsive data. As I noted in Wilson, we have not answered that question\\nyet. Wilson, 315 Ga. at 628-629 & n.12 (Pinson, J., concurring) (citing Orin S.\\nKerr, Executing Warrants for Digital Evidence: The Case for Use Restrictions\\non Nonresponsive Data, \\n48 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 1\\n (2015)).\\n                                      44\\n      PETERSON, Presiding Justice, concurring specially.\\n\\n     The majority’s analysis in Division 2 (b) regarding probable\\n\\ncause supporting the warrant at issue in this appeal represents a\\n\\nfaithful application of Divisions 2 (a) (i) and 2 (b) (i) of our recent\\n\\ndecision in Ledbetter. I did not join that division of Ledbetter,\\n\\narguing that we should instead overrule our all-but-already-\\n\\noverruled precedent of Gary v. State and resolve the issue by\\n\\napplying the Leon good faith exception. See Ledbetter, __ Ga. at __\\n\\n(Peterson, P.J., concurring specially). That remains my view, and so\\n\\nI similarly concur specially in Division 2 (b) today.\\n\\n     But I write separately today to express an additional concern.\\n\\nI am unconvinced by the Ledbetter majority’s probable cause\\n\\nanalysis. The probable cause required to support a valid warrant is\\n\\nprobable cause to believe that evidence will be found at the place to\\n\\nbe searched. The “place” to be searched in the warrants at issue in\\n\\nLedbetter were phone numbers. There was nothing at all in the\\n\\nwarrant affidavits about whose phones the numbers represented.\\n\\n                                  45\\n For the reasons the majority pointed out in Ledbetter, I’m not certain\\n\\nthat defeats probable cause. But I’m not certain it doesn’t, either. It\\n\\nseems to me the only reasonable inference supported by the\\n\\nLedbetter majority’s reasoning is that the officers writing the\\n\\naffidavits subjectively believed the numbers to belong to people\\n\\nnamed in the affidavits; without some detail in the affidavits\\n\\nexplaining why they held that belief, I question whether it is\\n\\nreasonable to take the next step the majority essentially took, that\\n\\nof presuming from the fact of the officers’ belief that such belief was\\n\\nitself supported by probable cause. We generally require warrant\\n\\naffidavits to provide detail from which a neutral magistrate can\\n\\ndetermine for themselves whether probable cause exists, rather\\n\\nthan merely defer to the unexplained implicit belief of law\\n\\nenforcement. Because my concern about the majority’s probable-\\n\\ncause analysis in Ledbetter applies equally to this case, I do not join\\n\\nthe majority’s application of that analysis here.\\n\\n     Making matters more difficult, little helpful federal precedent\\n\\n                                  46\\n exists on this question, because under federal law federal courts\\n\\nrarely need to decide it because the Leon good faith exception\\n\\nvirtually always applies. And until we finally erase the last traces of\\n\\nGary, we’ll have to keep deciding these difficult, fact-bound\\n\\nquestions that federal law has rendered largely irrelevant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  47\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9484196/andre-pugh-v-state/'}),\n",

McCULLUM v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       PINSON, Justice.\\n\\n       In November 2019, Appellant Samuel Earl McCullum was con-\\n\\nvicted of the 1998 rape and malice murder of Monica Blackwell and\\n\\nthe 1999 rape of C.C. 1 McCullum contends on appeal that his con-\\n\\nvictions for the malice murder and rape of Blackwell, who died of\\n\\n\\n       1 Blackwell died on August 6, 1998, and C.C. was raped on May 9, 1999.\\n\\nOn February 28, 2017, a DeKalb County grand jury indicted McCullum for\\nmalice murder (Count 1), felony murder predicated on rape (Count 2), felony\\nmurder predicated on aggravated assault with intent to rape (Count 3), and\\nrape (Count 4), all in connection with Blackwell, and for another count of rape\\n(Count 5), in connection with C.C. (Count 5 superseded a 2007 indictment that\\nhad also charged him with raping C.C.). At a trial from November 4 through\\n14, 2019, a jury found McCullum guilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced\\nMcCullum to life in prison for malice murder, plus two consecutive life sen-\\ntences for the rape convictions; the felony murder counts were vacated by op-\\neration of law.\\n       McCullum filed a timely motion for new trial on December 10, 2019,\\nwhich was amended by new counsel on October 28, 2022, and again on Decem-\\nber 14, 2022. Following a hearing on December 15, 2022, the trial court denied\\nMcCullum’s motion for new trial, as amended, on January 3, 2023. McCullum\\nfiled a timely notice of appeal on January 25, 2023, and the case was docketed\\n cocaine intoxication and blunt-force trauma, were not supported by\\n\\nsufficient evidence.2 As to malice murder, McCullum argues that the\\n\\nevidence was not sufficient because no evidence showed that he in-\\n\\ntoxicated Blackwell or otherwise connected him to the drugs she\\n\\ntook. As to Blackwell’s rape, he argues the evidence was not suffi-\\n\\ncient because the evidence did not exclude his hypothesis that he\\n\\nand Blackwell had a consensual sexual relationship. But the evi-\\n\\ndence, which we recount in detail below, was sufficient to authorize\\n\\nthe jury to find that McCullum’s actions caused Blackwell’s death\\n\\nand to convict him of malice murder. The evidence was also consti-\\n\\ntutionally sufficient to convict McCullum of Blackwell’s rape: evi-\\n\\ndence that Blackwell was found partially clothed and beaten by the\\n\\nside of the road with McCullum’s sperm in her vagina authorized\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto the August 2023 term of this Court and submitted for a decision on the\\nbriefs.\\n       2 To the extent McCullum challenges the sufficiency of the evidence sup-\\n\\nporting the counts for which he was found guilty but not convicted—the two\\ncounts of felony murder of Blackwell—those challenges are moot because the\\ncounts either merged or were vacated by operation of law. See, e.g., Beamon v.\\nState, \\n314 Ga. 798\\n, 800 (2) n.2 (\\n879 SE2d 457\\n) (2022).\\n\\n                                      2\\n the jury to reject his hypothesis that they had consensual sex. Fi-\\n\\nnally, with respect to the conviction for the rape of C.C., McCullum\\n\\ncontends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his mo-\\n\\ntion to dismiss that count on constitutional speedy trial grounds and\\n\\nin denying his motion to sever that count from the counts related to\\n\\nBlackwell’s murder and rape, but we conclude that the trial court\\n\\napplied the correct standards and did not abuse its discretion by\\n\\ndenying the speedy trial motion or the motion to sever.3\\n\\n      1. The Evidence at Trial\\n\\n      The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the\\n\\nverdicts, showed the following.\\n\\n      (a) Evidence of Blackwell’s Rape and Murder\\n\\n      Bonita Cox, Blackwell’s cousin, last saw Blackwell in early Au-\\n\\ngust 1998. Blackwell was a recovering drug addict, had been in re-\\n\\nhab, and, according to Cox, was “being a mother” to her son. On the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 McCullum does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence for his con-\\n\\nviction for the rape of C.C. See Davenport v. State, \\n309 Ga. 385\\n, 392 (4) (\\n846\\nSE2d 83\\n) (2020) (holding that we no longer routinely review sua sponte the\\nsufficiency of the evidence in non-death penalty cases).\\n                                       3\\n last day Cox saw her, Blackwell was with a man whom Cox had\\n\\nnever seen before. At trial, Cox identified McCullum in the court-\\n\\nroom as the man she saw Blackwell with that day. Blackwell intro-\\n\\nduced Cox to McCullum, said she would be back later, and left with\\n\\nhim. After that, Cox never saw Blackwell alive again.\\n\\n     On August 6, 1998, a group of friends saw a body on the road-\\n\\nside and reported it to the police. This turned out to be Blackwell,\\n\\nwho was partially clothed and “barely alive.” Blackwell was trans-\\n\\nported to the hospital, where she died.\\n\\n     Dr. Gerald Gowitt, the medical examiner who performed\\n\\nBlackwell’s autopsy, listed her cause of death as “acute cocaine in-\\n\\ntoxication.” Dr. Gowitt testified that Blackwell had several abra-\\n\\nsions on her face; a tooth knocked out, which was located in her\\n\\nesophagus; hemorrhages and bruises on the back of her head; and\\n\\nother similar blunt-force impacts to both sides of her head—all of\\n\\nwhich were consistent with someone hitting or beating her. Black-\\n\\nwell also had a “large amount” of benzoylecgonine, “a cocaine break-\\n\\ndown product,” in her blood.\\n\\n                                 4\\n      Dr. Gowitt explained that cocaine is a stimulant that raises the\\n\\nuser’s pulse and blood pressure, and “something you really don’t\\n\\nwant to have happen to you” while under the influence of cocaine is\\n\\nanother event, such as a beating or rape, that raises the pulse and\\n\\nblood pressure even more. Dr. Gowitt believed Blackwell died be-\\n\\ncause, while she was under the influence of cocaine, she experienced\\n\\n“a lot of trauma to the head,” which would have raised her pulse and\\n\\nblood pressure. Dr. Gowitt was unable to determine from the au-\\n\\ntopsy if Blackwell had been raped but opined that, if she had been,\\n\\nthat too would have contributed to her death in combination with\\n\\nthe beating and cocaine. He concluded that Blackwell died because\\n\\nof “[t]he combination of acute cocaine intoxication superimposed on\\n\\nall of these head injuries.”\\n\\n     During the autopsy, Dr. Gowitt also did a sexual assault work-\\n\\nup on Blackwell, consistent with the standard office policy at the\\n\\ntime for “any female that is murdered.” A GBI forensic scientist\\n\\nidentified the presence of sperm on the vaginal smear collected dur-\\n\\ning Blackwell’s autopsy, developed a DNA profile from the sperm,\\n\\n                                 5\\n and added that DNA profile to the Combined DNA Index System\\n\\n(CODIS).\\n\\n     A GBI forensic serologist tested Blackwell’s shorts but found\\n\\nno seminal fluid. In response to a hypothetical scenario posed by the\\n\\nState, the serologist agreed that the absence of seminal fluid on\\n\\nBlackwell’s shorts was more consistent with her being raped and\\n\\nthen dropped on the side of the road than it was with having consen-\\n\\nsual sex. If Blackwell had consensual sex, dressed, and walked\\n\\naround afterwards, gravity would have caused the seminal fluid to\\n\\nleave her body, and the fluid likely would have been found on her\\n\\nshorts.\\n\\n     In 2002, the DNA evidence collected during the investigation\\n\\nof Blackwell’s rape and murder was matched to McCullum via\\n\\nCODIS.\\n\\n     (b) Evidence of C.C.’s Rape\\n\\n     On the evening of May 9, 1999, C.C. was walking along Law-\\n\\nrenceville Highway when a car approached her and the man driving\\n\\noffered her a ride, which she accepted. The man told C.C. he needed\\n\\n                                   6\\n to stop by his work, pulled into an auto repair shop, locked the gate,\\n\\nand then pulled his car into one of the bays and closed the bay door.\\n\\nC.C. was worried at this point but was unable to flee because there\\n\\nwas a guard dog on the property that “seemed to be very vicious.”\\n\\nThe man raped C.C. in the back of the car. C.C. testified that the\\n\\nman was “very aggressive. So the more I fought him, the more ag-\\n\\ngressive he would become with me.” The man then made C.C. exit\\n\\nthe car and go into the bathroom, where he raped her again and tried\\n\\nto force her to give him oral sex; when she refused, he “hit” her and\\n\\n“knocked [her] to the ground,” and then raped her again. Eventually,\\n\\nthe man drove C.C. back to her apartment, letting her go after she\\n\\npromised she would not “tell on him” because she was “on the run”\\n\\n(she had come to Georgia because she was trying to avoid arrest for\\n\\ndrug charges in Ohio).\\n\\n     C.C.’s friends convinced her to report the rape, and she did. But\\n\\nshe gave the police a fake name because she did not want to be ar-\\n\\nrested for the pending charges in Ohio. C.C. submitted to a sexual\\n\\nassault examination, and her sexual assault kit was sent to the GBI,\\n\\n                                  7\\n where an analyst generated a DNA profile from sperm that was pre-\\n\\nsent on a vaginal swab collected during C.C.’s examination. That\\n\\nDNA was entered into CODIS. In 2002, the DNA evidence collected\\n\\nduring C.C.’s sexual assault examination was matched to McCullum\\n\\nvia CODIS.\\n\\n     At trial, C.C. identified McCullum in the courtroom as the man\\n\\nwho gave her a ride and raped her in May 1999. Sherri Meeks, the\\n\\nowner and operator of the auto repair shop that employed McCullum\\n\\nat the time of C.C.’s assault, testified that McCullum sometimes did\\n\\nrepairs overnight, alone, and that McCullum therefore had keys to\\n\\nthe property, which was fenced. Meeks also confirmed that a Ger-\\n\\nman Shepherd guard dog who was not “friendly to strangers” stayed\\n\\non the property at night to guard it.\\n\\n     (c) Evidence of the CODIS Match and Other Assaults\\n\\n     In 2007, investigators from Georgia traveled to North Carolina,\\n\\nwhere McCullum was incarcerated, to obtain a buccal swab from\\n\\nhim to confirm the CODIS matches to the DNA collected from Black-\\n\\nwell’s autopsy and C.C.’s sexual assault examination. The buccal\\n\\n                                  8\\n swab was tested and confirmed the match to the DNA collected in\\n\\nC.C.’s case in 2007;4 the match to the DNA from Blackwell’s case\\n\\nwas confirmed in 2017.5 McCullum’s DNA was also matched to evi-\\n\\ndence collected during the investigation of the 1995 rape and murder\\n\\nof Theresa Blackwell (no relation to Monica Blackwell) in North Car-\\n\\nolina, the 1998 rape and murder of Tamika Withers in Fulton\\n\\nCounty, Georgia, and the 2002 rape of a young woman, A.J., in Ken-\\n\\ntucky. At trial, the State introduced evidence of each of these as-\\n\\nsaults under OCGA § 24-4-413,6 which showed the following.\\n\\n      As to the rape of A.J. in Kentucky, officers responded to a 911\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 McCullum was indicted for C.C.’s rape in 2007, but that indictment was\\n\\nlater superseded by the 2017 indictment that charged him with crimes against\\nboth Blackwell and C.C.\\n       5 Investigator Bill Presnell explained that when he submitted McCul-\\n\\nlum’s buccal swab to the GBI in 2007, he thought the GBI would test the DNA\\nagainst both cases. But when Blackwell’s case was put on a trial calendar in\\n2017, he realized that the DNA had been confirmed against only C.C.’s case,\\nnot Blackwell’s case. He then submitted a new request to the GBI, and McCul-\\nlum’s buccal swab DNA was then confirmed against the DNA collected in\\nBlackwell’s case.\\n       6 That code section provides that “[i]n a criminal proceeding in which the\\n\\naccused is accused of an offense of sexual assault, evidence of the accused’s\\ncommission of another offense of sexual assault shall be admissible and may\\nbe considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.” OCGA §\\n24-4-413 (a). On appeal, McCullum does not challenge the admissibility of the\\nevidence of his assaults against A.J., Theresea Blackwell, or Withers.\\n                                       9\\n call from an auto repair shop reporting a rape in progress. When\\n\\nofficers arrived at the shop, they first encountered McCullum and\\n\\nthen heard a woman, A.J., screaming. Officers detained McCullum\\n\\nand then found A.J. chained to a pipe and bound with duct tape with\\n\\nher pants around her ankles. McCullum worked at the shop.\\n\\n     During the investigation of A.J.’s rape, officers in Kentucky\\n\\nlearned that McCullum had lived in Fayetteville, North Carolina in\\n\\n1995, contacted police in North Carolina, and suggested “it might be\\n\\na good idea” for them to check for any unsolved homicides during\\n\\nthat time. North Carolina police located a sexual assault kit with\\n\\nDNA evidence from the unsolved 1995 rape and murder of Theresa\\n\\nBlackwell, who had been found dead on the side of the road with her\\n\\nblouse pulled up, dried blood on her face and in her hair, and liga-\\n\\nture marks on her neck, hands, and ankles; a fan belt and bungee\\n\\ncord were also found near her body. The DNA evidence from Theresa\\n\\nBlackwell’s case produced a match in CODIS to McCullum. North\\n\\nCarolina police were able to confirm that in 1995, McCullum worked\\n\\nat an auto repair shop located less than a mile from where Theresa’s\\n\\n                                10\\n body was found.\\n\\n     Withers’s body was found in Fulton County, Georgia on March\\n\\n15, 1998. The dress she had been wearing was knotted around her\\n\\narm, she had blunt-force trauma and lacerations about her head and\\n\\nface, and her cause of death was blunt-force trauma. Forensic test-\\n\\ning revealed the presence of saliva on Withers’s breast, a DNA pro-\\n\\nfile was obtained from the saliva and added to CODIS, and that DNA\\n\\nwas later matched to McCullum.\\n\\n     2. The Sufficiency of the Evidence of Malice Murder\\n\\n     McCullum contends that the evidence was insufficient as a\\n\\nmatter of constitutional due process to support his conviction for the\\n\\nmalice murder of Blackwell. He argues that the State failed to prove\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he caused Blackwell’s death because\\n\\nthere was no evidence that he gave Blackwell the cocaine that killed\\n\\nher or that otherwise connected him to the cocaine she took.\\n\\n     (a) In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process, “the relevant question is whether, after\\n\\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\\n\\n                                 11\\n any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\\n\\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Cooper v. State, \\n317 Ga. 676\\n,\\n\\n682 (1) (\\n895 SE2d 285\\n) (2023) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S.\\n\\n307\\n, 319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979)).\\n\\n     “A person commits the offense of murder when he unlawfully\\n\\nand with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the\\n\\ndeath of another human being.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (a). In other words,\\n\\nthe essential elements that must be proven to convict someone of\\n\\nmalice murder are (1) malice, (2) causation, and (3) the death of an-\\n\\nother person. See Taylor v. State, \\n303 Ga. 624\\n, 626 (1) (\\n814 SE2d\\n\\n353\\n) (2018). “Whether a killing is intentional and malicious is for the\\n\\njury to determine from all the facts and circumstances.” \\nId.\\n (punctu-\\n\\nation and citation omitted). A malicious intent to kill can be shown\\n\\nby conduct the defendant knows “is substantially certain to cause\\n\\nthe result, whether or not he desires the result to occur.” \\nId.\\n (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). “Cause,” for purposes of malice murder,\\n\\nis “proximate cause.” Id. at 627 (1). An injury proximately causes the\\n\\nvictim’s death when the injury (1) is “the sole proximate cause of the\\n\\n                                   12\\n death,” (2) “directly and materially” contributes to the “happening of\\n\\na subsequent accruing immediate cause of the death,” or (3) “mate-\\n\\nrially accelerated the death, although proximately occasioned by a\\n\\npre-existing cause.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     The evidence at McCullum’s trial, viewed in the light most fa-\\n\\nvorable to the verdicts, authorized the jury to conclude that McCul-\\n\\nlum’s conduct caused Blackwell’s death because, at a minimum, he\\n\\n“materially accelerated” her death by beating and raping her, even\\n\\nif the death was “proximately occasioned by a pre-existing cause,”\\n\\nthat is, cocaine intoxication. See id. The evidence showed that\\n\\nMcCullum and Blackwell were together before her death, he was the\\n\\nlast person she was seen with when she was alive, semen found in\\n\\nBlackwell’s vagina produced a DNA profile that matched McCul-\\n\\nlum’s DNA, the absence of seminal fluid on Blackwell’s shorts was\\n\\nmore consistent with rape than consensual sex, and she had blunt-\\n\\nforce injuries to her head that were consistent with hitting or beat-\\n\\ning. Although the medical examiner listed Blackwell’s cause of death\\n\\nas “acute cocaine intoxication,” he testified that the “combination” of\\n\\n                                  13\\n Blackwell’s head injuries and her cocaine intoxication together\\n\\ncaused her death; he also agreed that a rape would have further\\n\\nraised Blackwell’s blood pressure and pulse, and so would have also\\n\\ncontributed to her death. Based on this evidence, the jury was au-\\n\\nthorized to conclude that McCullum beat and raped Blackwell and\\n\\nleft her on the side of the road while she was under the influence of\\n\\ncocaine. The jury was also authorized, based on the medical evi-\\n\\ndence, to conclude that the beating and rape caused her death be-\\n\\ncause, according to the medical examiner’s testimony, those events,\\n\\nin combination with the cocaine, caused her death.\\n\\n     As for malice, the evidence authorized the jury to infer malice\\n\\nfrom the condition Blackwell was found in—nearly dead by the side\\n\\nof the road, only partially dressed, with significant head injuries.\\n\\nThis condition was also nearly identical to the conditions in which\\n\\nMcCullum’s other rape and murder victims were found. Like Black-\\n\\nwell, the murder and rape victims from North Carolina and Fulton\\n\\nCounty, Georgia were also found by the side of the road, partially\\n\\nclothed, with head injuries and bodily fluids containing McCullum’s\\n\\n                                 14\\n DNA on them.\\n\\n     In sum, the evidence was constitutionally sufficient to support\\n\\nMcCullum’s conviction for the malice murder of Blackwell. See, e.g.,\\n\\nTaylor, 303 Ga. at 626-628 (1) (affirming conviction for malice mur-\\n\\nder where the evidence authorized the jury to conclude that the de-\\n\\nfendant intended to hit the victim with his car, which was the prox-\\n\\nimate cause of the victim’s death from an embolism).\\n\\n     (b) McCullum points out that the indictment charged that he\\n\\n“did with malice aforethought cause the death of Monica Blackwell,\\n\\na human being, by cocaine intoxication in a manner unknown to the\\n\\nGrand Jury and dumping her without medical assistance on the side\\n\\nof the road.” Relying on the indictment’s language, he argues that\\n\\nthe evidence therefore was not constitutionally sufficient because no\\n\\nevidence connected him to the cocaine Blackwell took, so the State\\n\\ndid not prove that he caused her death “by cocaine intoxication” as\\n\\nthe indictment specified. But in support of this argument, McCullum\\n\\ncites only the United States Supreme Court’s pathmarking decision\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 15\\n on the due process standard for assessing the sufficiency of the evi-\\n\\ndence, Jackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n (III) (B), and one of our\\n\\ndecisions applying Jackson’s standard. And that standard asks\\n\\n“whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\\n\\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essen-\\n\\ntial elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” \\nId.\\n (second\\n\\nemphasis added). In other words, the Supreme Court’s standard ex-\\n\\npressly says that evidence is measured against the essential ele-\\n\\nments of the crime, with no mention of other factual allegations set\\n\\nout in the indictment that are not elements of the crime. That is how\\n\\nwe have consistently applied Jackson’s venerable standard since it\\n\\nwas announced more than four decades ago. When our sufficiency\\n\\ndecisions have looked to the indictment, they have done so only to\\n\\ndetermine which crime was charged, and whether the evidence was\\n\\nsufficient to authorize a jury to find the defendant guilty of that\\n\\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Harrington v.

McCullum has not cited\\n\\nany decision (from Georgia or otherwise) that supports this indict-\\n\\nment-allegation-focused approach, which his argument at best im-\\n\\nplicitly suggests. Nor has he offered any argument in support of de-\\n\\nparting from our longstanding approach to applying Jackson to the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                17\\n essential elements of the crime.7 Absent any such showing, we de-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 In Musacchio v. United States, \\n577 U.S. 237\\n (136 SCt 70, 193 LE2d 639)\\n\\n(2016), the United States Supreme Court reiterated that, under Jackson v. Vir-\\nginia, a challenge to the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence looks to\\n“whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prose-\\ncution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.” 577 U.S. at 243 (II) (citation and punctua-\\ntion omitted) (second emphasis added). The question in Musacchio was\\nwhether, in assessing the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence, a jury in-\\nstruction that “incorrectly adds one more element” to the charged crime re-\\nquires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of that extra element; the Court con-\\ncluded that such proof of an extra element was not required. Id. at 243-244 (II).\\n       In a footnote, the Court noted that it left “open several matters,” and\\n“express[ed] no view on the question whether sufficiency of the evidence at trial\\nmust be judged by reference to the elements charged in the indictment, even if\\nthe indictment charges one or more elements not required by statute,” among\\nother questions. Id. at 244 (II) n.2. We must take the Court’s explanation at\\nface value: the Court simply took “no view” on the question whether the suffi-\\nciency analysis should measure evidence against not just the elements of the\\ncrime, but also extra “elements” added in the indictment that are not part of\\nthe crime. The Court offered nothing to suggest that this novel theory of suffi-\\nciency finds support in Jackson or any of its past decisions. Nor does the bal-\\nance of Musacchio hint at such a theory. The dissent suggests that Musacchio\\nis both “consistent with” and may go “further” than Jackson in this way when\\nit explains sufficiency review as ensuring “that a defendant receives . . . a\\nmeaningful opportunity to defend against the charges against him,” but that\\nunderstanding of sufficiency review comes directly from—and indeed, is a\\nquote from—Jackson itself. See Musacchio, 577 U.S. at 243 (II) (quoting Jack-\\nson, \\n443 U.S. at 314-315\\n). We decline to read reasoning derived from Jackson\\nitself as an expansion of that decision’s standard for sufficiency review. Nor do\\nwe read Jackson itself to require more than what it says, which is to look at\\nwhether “any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt” when assessing the constitutional suffi-\\nciency of the evidence. Jackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n (III) (B) (second emphasis\\nadded).\\n                                       18\\n cline to expand that settled approach in the way McCullum’s suffi-\\n\\nciency argument would require.8 And as we just explained above,\\n\\nthe evidence here was sufficient to authorize the jury to find beyond\\n\\na reasonable doubt that each essential element of malice murder\\n\\n\\n      8 We do not decide a “difficult open question of federal constitutional law”\\n\\nhere, as the dissent suggests. As we noted above, we do not read the Supreme\\nCourt’s decision in Musacchio to have “opened” any such question anew about\\nJackson’s well-settled standard for assessing the constitutional sufficiency of\\nthe evidence, and McCullum has raised no argument that we should address\\nand decide any such “open question.” Given this posture, we merely apply Jack-\\nson’s established standard and measure the evidence against the essential el-\\nements of the charged offense, just like thousands of our decisions assessing\\nthe constitutional sufficiency of evidence in the nearly 45 years since Jackson\\nwas issued.\\n       By contrast, the dissent would expand sufficiency review in a novel way\\nwithout citing a single decision across the country that has actually adopted\\nthat expanded approach. Although the dissent proposes an alternative path to\\nreversal by construing McCullum’s sufficiency argument as a fatal variance\\nclaim, the dissent resolves this claim by applying its expanded view of the\\nstandard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to reverse the trial\\ncourt’s denial of McCullum’s motion for a directed verdict on malice murder.\\nSo under either the dissent’s novel indictment-based sufficiency review or the\\nconstrued fatal-variance theory, the dissent necessarily rejects the longstand-\\ning approach to sufficiency review that we apply here, under which McCul-\\nlum’s conviction is affirmed.\\n       The dissent expresses concern about the “due process implications” of\\napplying Jackson’s established approach, relying on a hypothetical prosecution\\nfor malice murder by shooting that the State proves at trial by evidence of poi-\\nsoning or stabbing. We agree that scenario sounds unfair, but the defendant’s\\nrecourse there is clear: he could raise a fatal variance claim and secure a new\\ntrial if the difference between the indictment and the evidence introduced at\\ntrial prevented him from preparing his defense, took him by surprise, or failed\\nto adequately protect against another prosecution for the same offense. See,\\ne.g., Roscoe v. State, \\n288 Ga. 775\\n, 776 (3) (\\n707 SE2d 90\\n) (2011). See also Berger\\nv. United States, \\n295 U.S. 78\\n, 82 (1) (55 SCt 629, 79 LE2d 1314) (1935).\\n                                       19\\n was met. His claim therefore fails. 9\\n\\n      3. The Sufficiency of the Evidence of the Rape of Blackwell\\n\\n      McCullum contends that the evidence at trial was not suffi-\\n\\ncient to convict him of Blackwell’s rape as either a matter of consti-\\n\\ntutional due process or under OCGA § 24-14-6 (“To warrant a con-\\n\\nviction on circumstantial evidence, the proved facts shall not only be\\n\\nconsistent with the hypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude every other\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      9 McCullum’s only enumeration and argument challenging his malice\\n\\nmurder conviction is that the evidence was insufficient to support that convic-\\ntion as a matter of constitutional due process. A sufficiency claim is different\\nin kind from a fatal-variance claim, which “merely is concerned with proof in-\\ntroduced in support of allegations and is not concerned with the findings the\\njury may make after having heard the evidence.” See Oglesby v. State, \\n243 Ga.\\n690\\n, 692 (3) (\\n256 SE2d 371\\n) (1979) (emphasis added). See also McCrary v.\\nState, \\n252 Ga. 521\\n, 522, 524 (\\n314 SE2d 662\\n) (1984) (concluding that the evi-\\ndence was constitutionally sufficient to support the conviction for felony mur-\\nder predicated on robbery but reversing that conviction because of a fatal var-\\niance where the indictment for malice murder did not “fairly put[] the defend-\\nant on notice” that he would have to defend against a charge of robbery or a\\nfelony murder predicated thereon). Even to the extent that McCullum’s suffi-\\nciency argument notes a difference between an allegation in the indictment\\nand the proof at trial, he has offered no argument that this difference was a\\nfatal variance—that is, that it prevented him from preparing his defense to the\\ncharges against him, took him by surprise, or failed to adequately protect him\\nagainst another prosecution for the same offense. See, e.g., Roscoe, \\n288 Ga. at\\n776\\n (3). So we cannot reasonably construe McCullum’s sufficiency arguments\\nas a fatal-variance claim, and we express no opinion as to whether such a claim\\ncould have been successful were it properly before us.\\n\\n                                      20\\n reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.”).\\n\\n     These claims fail. Viewed in the light most favorable to the ver-\\n\\ndict, the evidence showed that McCullum was the last person seen\\n\\nwith Blackwell before she was found beaten and left on the side of\\n\\nthe road, half naked, and with his sperm in her vagina, and the ab-\\n\\nsence of seminal fluid in Blackwell’s shorts was more consistent with\\n\\nrape than consensual sex. That evidence authorized a jury to find\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that McCullum raped Blackwell, and to\\n\\nreject as unreasonable the hypothesis that Blackwell consented to\\n\\nhaving sex with McCullum. See OCGA § 16-6-1 (a) (1) (“A person\\n\\ncommits the offense of rape when he has carnal knowledge of: . . . [a]\\n\\nfemale forcibly and against her will.”). See also Lewis v. State, \\n306\\n\\nGa. 455\\n, 457, 459 (1) (a) (\\n831 SE2d 771\\n) (2019) (evidence which in-\\n\\ncluded that the victim’s body was discovered partially undressed,\\n\\nhad defensive wounds, and had defendant’s sperm in her vagina was\\n\\nsufficient to sustain his convictions for murder and rape, and au-\\n\\nthorized the jury to reject his alternate hypothesis, that he and the\\n\\nvictim had consensual sex, as unreasonable); Daniels v. State, 298\\n\\n                                 21\\nGa. 120\\n, 123 (1) (\\n779 SE2d 640\\n) (2015) (evidence, including the state\\n\\nin which the victim’s body was found, DNA evidence linking the de-\\n\\nfendant to the victim, and evidence of prior similarly violent sexual\\n\\nconduct by the defendant, was “sufficient to support the jury’s con-\\n\\nclusion that [the defendant] assaulted, raped, and murdered [the\\n\\nvictim] as opposed to having engaged in consensual sex with her\\n\\nprior to her death at the hands of another”); Walker v. State, \\n282 Ga.\\n\\n406\\n, 408 (1) (\\n651 SE2d 12\\n) (2007) (evidence, which included the state\\n\\nin which the victim’s body was discovered and DNA evidence linking\\n\\nthe defendant to the victim, was sufficient to support the jury’s con-\\n\\nclusion that the defendant raped and murdered the victim, and au-\\n\\nthorized the jury to reject the defendant’s alternate hypotheses, in-\\n\\ncluding that he and the victim had consensual sex).\\n\\n     4. The Speedy Trial Motion\\n\\n     McCullum contends that the trial court abused its discretion in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  22\\n denying his motion to dismiss Count 5 (rape of C.C.) on constitu-\\n\\ntional speedy trial grounds. 10\\n\\n      McCullum was initially indicted for C.C.’s rape in 2007. In\\n\\n2011, he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for violations of his\\n\\nright to a speedy trial under the federal and state constitutions. A\\n\\nmonth later, the case was dead-docketed because McCullum was\\n\\ntransferred to Kentucky to stand trial for the rape of A.J. In 2017,\\n\\nhe was reindicted for C.C.’s rape in a superseding indictment that\\n\\nalso included charges for the rape and murder of Blackwell. On June\\n\\n22, 2017, McCullum filed a “Motion to Adopt and Conform Applica-\\n\\nble Motions Filed under [the] Previous Indictment,” which encom-\\n\\npassed the 2011 motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. The trial\\n\\ncourt held a hearing on the speedy trial motion, orally denied the\\n\\nmotion, and then entered a written order of denial on July 13, 2017.\\n\\n      On June 24, 2019, McCullum renewed his speedy trial motion.\\n\\n\\n      10 McCullum does not contend that the speedy trial provision found in\\n\\nArticle I, Section I, Paragraph XI (a) of the Georgia Constitution offers greater\\nprotection than the analogous provision found in the Sixth Amendment to the\\nUnited States Constitution, so we assess his claim under only the United\\nStates Constitution.\\n                                       23\\n The trial court held another evidentiary hearing and again denied\\n\\nthe motion. The court’s July 25, 2019, order incorporated the factual\\n\\nfindings and rulings from the July 2017 order and included addi-\\n\\ntional findings with respect to the evidence that McCullum pre-\\n\\nsented at the 2019 hearing.\\n\\n     Constitutional speedy trial claims are analyzed under the two-\\n\\npart framework set out in Barker v. Wingo, \\n407 U.S. 514\\n, 530-533\\n\\n(IV) (92 SCt 2182, 33 LE2d 101) (1972), and Doggett v. United States,\\n\\n505 U.S. 647\\n, 651 (II) (112 SCt 2686, 120 LE2d 520) (1992). Courts\\n\\nmust first consider whether the length of time between the defend-\\n\\nant’s arrest and trial is “presumptively prejudicial,” and a delay\\n\\ngreater than one year is “typically presumed to be prejudicial.” Go-\\n\\nins v. State, \\n306 Ga. 55\\n, 57 (2) (b) (\\n829 SE2d 89\\n) (2019) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). The State concedes that the decade-plus delay\\n\\nbetween McCullum’s indictment and trial for C.C.’s rape was pre-\\n\\nsumptively prejudicial, and we agree. See \\nid.\\n\\n\\n     If a court concludes the delay is presumptively prejudicial, as\\n\\nthe trial court correctly did here, it must then apply a balancing test\\n\\n                                  24\\n that considers the length and reasons for the delay, the defendant’s\\n\\nassertion of his speedy-trial right, and the prejudice to the defend-\\n\\nant. See Johnson v. State, \\n300 Ga. 252\\n, 257 (3) (\\n794 SE2d 60\\n) (2016).\\n\\nThese factors are to be considered collectively along with the rele-\\n\\nvant circumstances, see Leonard v. State, \\n316 Ga. 827\\n, 839 (6) (\\n889\\n\\nSE2d 837\\n) (2023), and no one element is determinative of whether\\n\\nthe right to a speedy trial has been violated, see Sweatman v. State,\\n\\n287 Ga. 872\\n, 873 (2) (\\n700 SE2d 579\\n) (2010). Because trial courts are\\n\\ngenerally better situated to apply this “ad hoc” approach, we “accept\\n\\nthe factual findings of the trial court unless they are clearly errone-\\n\\nous” and we accept the trial court’s conclusion “unless it amounts to\\n\\nan abuse of discretion.” See Henderson v. State, \\n310 Ga. 231\\n, 235 (2)\\n\\n(\\n850 SE2d 152\\n) (2020) (citation omitted). We next address each of\\n\\nthe Barker-Doggett factors in turn.\\n\\n     (a) The Length of the Delay\\n\\n     As stated above, we agree with the trial court that the 10-plus-\\n\\nyear delay between McCullum’s indictment and trial for C.C.’s rape\\n\\nwas presumptively prejudicial. See Goins, 305 Ga. at 57 (2) (b). The\\n\\n                                   25\\n trial court found that McCullum had been incarcerated out of state\\n\\nfor eight of the ten-plus years that comprised the delay, thus miti-\\n\\ngating the weight the delay’s length had against the State, and ruled\\n\\nthat “[w]eighing the length of the delay under the unique facts and\\n\\ncircumstances of this case, the delay should be weighed against the\\n\\nState but not heavily.” We agree that the delay was uncommonly\\n\\nlong, yet under the circumstances of this case, we see no abuse of the\\n\\ntrial court’s discretion in weighing that factor against the State but\\n\\nnot heavily given that a presumptively prejudicial length of delay\\n\\ndoes not “automatically trump the other Barker factors” and must\\n\\ninstead be considered as part of the “case-by-case balancing required\\n\\nby Barker and this Court’s precedent.” See State v. Pickett, \\n288 Ga.\\n\\n674\\n, 678 (2) (d) n.1 (\\n706 SE2d 561\\n) (2011) (“[A] bright-line rule al-\\n\\nlowing the presumption of prejudice after any period of delay to au-\\n\\ntomatically trump the other Barker factors would be contrary to the\\n\\ncase-by-case balancing required by Barker and this Court’s prece-\\n\\ndent.”).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 26\\n      (b) The Reasons for the Delay\\n\\n     The trial court found that from 2007 to 2009, McCullum was\\n\\nincarcerated in North Carolina and Kentucky, so his incarceration\\n\\nduring that period was not attributable to the pending rape charge\\n\\nin Georgia. From 2009 to 2011, the trial court found, McCullum was\\n\\nincarcerated in Georgia while awaiting trial for C.C.’s rape but, at\\n\\nthe same time, was also serving his sentence for his North Carolina\\n\\nconviction. The trial court also found that from September 2011 to\\n\\nFebruary 2017, the case was dead docketed at the State’s request to\\n\\npermit Kentucky’s prosecution of McCullum for the rape of A.J.\\n\\nMcCullum was extradited back to Georgia in February 2017, and\\n\\nsince February 2017, McCullum had been arraigned and motions\\n\\nhad been heard. The trial court also considered the complexity of the\\n\\ncase and the State’s difficulty in locating an out-of-state witness,\\n\\nnoted that the case appeared on “several trial calendars” during this\\n\\nperiod but did not go forward, and concluded that this factor “should\\n\\nweigh against the State, but not heavily,” in part because McCullum\\n\\nbore “some moderate responsibility for the delay,” as he represented\\n\\n                                 27\\n at one point that he was not ready to proceed.\\n\\n     The record supports the trial court’s findings regarding the rea-\\n\\nsons for the delay, and under the circumstances of this case, we see\\n\\nno abuse in the trial court’s discretion in ruling that those reasons\\n\\nshould be weighed against the State, but not heavily so. See Barker,\\n\\n407 U.S. at 531\\n (IV) (“A deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order\\n\\nto hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the gov-\\n\\nernment,” while an unintentional delay, such as that caused by the\\n\\nmere negligence of the prosecuting attorneys or the overcrowded\\n\\ndocket of the trial court, “should be weighted less heavily.”). Accord\\n\\nWilkie v. State, \\n290 Ga. 450\\n, 452 (\\n721 SE2d 830\\n) (2012); Sweatman,\\n\\n287 Ga. at 875\\n (4); Hassel v. State, \\n284 Ga. 861\\n, 862 (b) (\\n672 SE2d\\n\\n627\\n) (2009).\\n\\n     (c) The Assertion of the Right to a Speedy Trial\\n\\n     The trial court found that McCullum failed to raise the speedy\\n\\ntrial issue until more than two years after his indictment and\\n\\nweighed this factor “against Defendant, but not heavily.” Neither\\n\\nparty asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in so ruling,\\n\\n                                  28\\n and we see no abuse of discretion either. See Pickett, \\n288 Ga. at 676\\n\\n\\n(2) (c) (3) (“[A] defendant may assert his constitutional right to a\\n\\nspeedy trial at any time after he is arrested. . . . However, once his\\n\\nconstitutional right accrues, the defendant has the responsibility to\\n\\nassert it, and delay in doing so normally will be weighed against\\n\\nhim.”) (citations omitted).\\n\\n     (d) Prejudice\\n\\n     In assessing the prejudice of the delay to McCullum, the trial\\n\\ncourt considered the “oppressive pretrial incarceration, anxiety and\\n\\nconcern of the accused, and the possibility that the accused’s defense\\n\\nwill be impaired by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evi-\\n\\ndence.” See Doggett, \\n505 U.S. at 654\\n (III) (A) (quoting Barker, \\n407\\n\\nU.S. at 532\\n (IV)) (punctuation omitted)). The trial court noted that\\n\\nthis Court has recognized a “minimal possibility of oppressive pre-\\n\\ntrial incarceration” when a defendant was incarcerated for a sepa-\\n\\nrate offense, see Williams v. State, \\n279 Ga. 106\\n, 109 (1) (d) (\\n610 SE2d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n 32) (2005) (punctuation omitted);11 that McCullum had presented no\\n\\nevidence that he experienced oppressive pretrial incarceration or\\n\\nundue stress or anxiety due to the pending Georgia rape charge; and\\n\\nthat “[m]ost critically . . . the record contains no evidence nor any\\n\\narticulated prejudice to Defendant’s prospective defense likely to oc-\\n\\ncur at trial.” 12 Therefore, the court ruled that “[u]nder the unique\\n\\n\\n      11 On this point, McCullum relies on Redding v. State, \\n313 Ga. 730\\n (\\n873\\n\\nSE2d 158\\n) (2022) (“Redding II”) to argue that the trial court abused its discre-\\ntion in relying on McCullum’s incarceration on the North Carolina charges in\\nfinding no prejudice. But in Redding II, we held that the trial court erred in\\nruling that the defendant’s probation hold on other charges, which prevented\\nhim from making bond, precluded the need to assess prejudice associated with\\npretrial incarceration. See Redding II, 313 Ga. at 735-736 (2). Redding II did\\nnot overrule Williams or its recognition that the possibility of oppressive pre-\\ntrial incarceration is generally minimal when a defendant is already incarcer-\\nated for unrelated offenses, so we see no abuse of the trial court’s discretion\\nhere, where the trial court plainly assessed this factor and whether McCullum\\nprovided any evidence thereon as part of its prejudice analysis.\\n       12 In its 2019 order, which incorporated the factual findings and rulings\\n\\nof the 2017 order, the trial court noted that at the more recent hearing McCul-\\nlum was permitted to provide additional evidence on prejudice. McCullum\\ncalled an investigator from the public defender’s office who testified that he\\nwas able to locate a witness who was familiar with McCullum and C.C. but\\nthat the witness was hostile and did not wish to speak with him further. Our\\nreview shows that the witness whom the investigator referred to was Meeks,\\nthe owner and operator of the mechanic shop where McCullum worked and\\nwhere he raped C.C. The investigator testified that “to my knowledge she was\\nsupposed to be able to testify or give me a statement about her seeing [McCul-\\nlum] with the alleged victim two or three days after the alleged incident was\\nsupposed to have happened,” but that when he spoke with her in 2019, “she\\ncouldn’t recall specifically seeing him with her after the incident because she\\n\\n                                      30\\n circumstances of this case . . . this final factor is weighed heavily\\n\\nagainst Defendant.”\\n\\n      The record supports the trial court’s findings that McCullum\\n\\nfailed to present sufficient evidence—and that the record otherwise\\n\\nlacked sufficient evidence—of prejudice under the fourth Barker-\\n\\nDoggett factor. Although we recognize that extraordinarily long pre-\\n\\ntrial delays “simultaneously increase the degree of prejudice pre-\\n\\nsumed and decrease the expectation that the defendant can demon-\\n\\nstrate tangible prejudice,” it remains true that “the passage of time\\n\\nis not alone sufficient to sustain a speedy trial claim.” Williams v.\\n\\nState, \\n277 Ga. 598\\n, 601 (1) (d) (\\n592 SE2d 848\\n) (2004). Under the cir-\\n\\ncumstances of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\\n\\nin weighing this factor against McCullum. See Williams v. State, \\n314\\n\\nGa. 671\\n, 680 (4) (d) (\\n878 SE2d 553\\n) (2022) (“[W]hile a presumption\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncouldn’t recall the incident time with any specificity.” He added, “she seemed\\nhostile. She didn’t want to be involved in any form or fashion, and so she was\\nreally short with me.” We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s conclu-\\nsion that even in light of this evidence, “there is still no showing of specific\\nprejudice by the defense.”\\n                                       31\\n of prejudice always exists once the threshold of presumptive preju-\\n\\ndice is satisfied, the prejudice prong may be weighed against the de-\\n\\nfendant even in cases of excessive delay.” (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)). See also Burney v. State, \\n309 Ga. 273\\n, 286 (4) (a), 290-291\\n\\n(4) (d) (\\n845 SE2d 625\\n) (2020) (holding that the defendant failed to\\n\\nmake the requisite showing of prejudice under the fourth Barker-\\n\\nDoggett factor despite presumptively prejudicial six-and-a-half-year\\n\\ndelay). Cf. Williams, \\n279 Ga. at 109-110\\n (1) (d) (“We agree with the\\n\\ntrial court that while the prejudice factor must not be weighed heav-\\n\\nily against Williams, he has been unable to show any specific im-\\n\\npairment to his defense attributable to the delay.”).\\n\\n     (e) Balancing the Factors\\n\\n     After making the above findings and conclusions, the trial\\n\\ncourt balanced the factors and denied the motion, noting that the\\n\\nlength and reason for the delay weighed against the State, but not\\n\\nheavily; McCullum’s two-year delay in asserting his speedy-trial\\n\\nright weighed “slightly” against him; and the absence of prejudice\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 32\\n weighed “heavily” against McCullum, so on balance and in the ab-\\n\\nsence of any evidence “that the State delayed the case to hamper the\\n\\ndefense or gain a tactical advantage,” the lengthy delay was “rea-\\n\\nsonable under the circumstances and in light of the complexity of\\n\\nthe case.” The trial court’s detailed and reasoned denial orders show\\n\\nthat it fulfilled its duty to weigh all four Barker-Doggett factors in\\n\\nthe context of the particular circumstances of this case. See Jenkins\\n\\nv. State, \\n294 Ga. 506\\n, 513 (2) (c) (\\n755 SE2d 138\\n) (2014). And under\\n\\nthe circumstances of this case, we see no abuse in the trial court’s\\n\\ndiscretion in applying the Barker-Doggett framework and denying\\n\\nMcCullum’s motions to dismiss Count 5 of the indictment for the\\n\\nviolation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. See id.\\n\\n     5. The Motion to Sever\\n\\n     McCullum finally contends that the trial court abused its dis-\\n\\ncretion by not severing Count 5 (rape of C.C.) from Counts 1-4 (rape\\n\\nand murder of Blackwell) because he had an “absolute right to sever”\\n\\nand the crimes against each woman were so dissimilar.\\n\\n     McCullum filed a pretrial motion to sever, which the trial court\\n\\n                                   33\\n denied after a hearing. As relevant here, the trial court ruled that\\n\\n“under OCGA § 24-4-413, the sexual assault of [C.C.] would clearly\\n\\nbe admissible during the trial of the sexual assault and murder of\\n\\nMonica Blackwell.”\\n\\n     A defendant has an “absolute right” to severance when charges\\n\\nare joined together “solely because they are of the same or similar\\n\\ncharacter,” while severance lies within the trial court’s discretion\\n\\nwhen joinder is based on “the same conduct or on a series of acts\\n\\nconnected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.”\\n\\nSee Harris v. State, \\n314 Ga. 238\\n, 281 (4) (\\n875 SE2d 659\\n) (2022) (ci-\\n\\ntations and punctuation omitted). But multiple offenses are not\\n\\njoined together “solely because they are the same or similar charac-\\n\\nter” if evidence of one offense would be admissible at a separate trial\\n\\nfor the other. See Carson v. State, \\n308 Ga. 761\\n, 765 (2) (a) (\\n843 SE2d\\n\\n421\\n) (2020) (quoting Green v. State, \\n291 Ga. 287\\n, 289 (2) (\\n728 SE2d\\n\\n668\\n) (2012)). Typically, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in\\n\\ndenying a motion to sever where evidence of one charge would be\\n\\nadmissible in the trial of the other and there is no evidence that the\\n\\n                                  34\\n joinder confused or misled the jury. See Carson, 308 Ga. at 765-766\\n\\n(2) (a); Heard v. State, \\n287 Ga. 554\\n, 558-559 (4) (\\n697 SE2d 811\\n)\\n\\n(2010). Cf. Harris, 314 Ga. at 282 (4) (concluding the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion in denying defendant’s motion to sever the\\n\\ncounts charging the defendant with a sex crime against a minor from\\n\\ncharges related to the death of the defendant’s son where the of-\\n\\nfenses were “of an entirely different character”).\\n\\n     McCullum concedes that, under OCGA § 24-4-413, the evidence\\n\\nof C.C.’s rape “might be admissible” during the trial of Blackwell’s\\n\\nrape and murder, and we agree with the trial court that the evidence\\n\\nof C.C.’s rape would have been admissible under Rule 413 at a trial\\n\\nfor Blackwell’s rape and murder. See OCGA § 24-4-413 (a) (in any\\n\\ncriminal proceeding where the defendant is accused of sexual as-\\n\\nsault, evidence that the defendant committed other sexual assaults\\n\\nis admissible for any relevant purpose). He also has not offered any\\n\\nevidence that the failure to sever his trial for C.C.’s rape from his\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  35\\n trial for Blackwell’s rape and murder confused or misled the jury.13\\n\\nSee, e.g., Simmons v. State, \\n282 Ga. 183\\n, 185-186 (4) (\\n646 SE2d 55\\n)\\n\\n(2007). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse\\n\\nits discretion in refusing to sever Count 5 (rape of C.C.) from Counts\\n\\n1-4 (rape and murder of Blackwell). See Carson, 308 Ga. at 765-766\\n\\n(2) (a); Heard, \\n287 Ga. at 558-559\\n (4).\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur, except Peterson,\\nP.J., Bethel, and McMillian, JJ., who dissent in part.\\n\\n      13 McCullum concedes that the evidence of C.C.’s rape “might be admis-\\n\\nsible” under Rule 413 but contends that it should have been excluded under\\nOCGA § 24-4-403 (Rule 403) because the probative value of the evidence of the\\nsexual assault of C.C. did not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect of\\nMcCullum “having to defend multiple trials within a trial.” But he has not\\npointed on appeal to any unfair prejudice that resulted from the introduction\\nof this evidence. At most, he argues that evidence of C.C.’s rape should have\\nbeen excluded because it tended to support the State’s theory that the presence\\nof his semen in Blackwell’s vagina resulted from rape rather than his conten-\\ntion that he and Balckwell had consensual sex. But although “inculpatory evi-\\ndence is inherently prejudicial in a criminal case,” the risk of some prejudice\\ndoes not require exclusion. “[I]t is only when unfair prejudice substantially\\noutweighs probative value that the rule permits exclusion.” See Harris v. State,\\n313 Ga. 225\\n, 232 (3) (\\n869 SE2d 461\\n) (2022). Because McCullum has not made\\nthis showing, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\\nfailing to rule that evidence of C.C.’s rape should be excluded under Rule 403\\nand granting the motion to sever on that basis. See McWilliams v. State, \\n304\\nGa. 502\\n, 509-511 (3) (2018) (reviewing for an abuse of discretion the defend-\\nant’s claim that the admission of extrinsic evidence under OCGA §§ 24-4-404\\n(b) and 24-4-413 violated Rule 403 and concluding the probative value of the\\nprior sexual assaults, which tended to disprove the defendant’s claim that the\\nmurder victim’s injuries were accidental, was not outweighed by the risk of\\nunfair prejudice). See also Carson, 308 Ga. at 765-766 (2) (a); Heard, \\n287 Ga.\\nat 558-559\\n (4).\\n                                      36\\n      MCMILLIAN, Justice, dissenting in part.\\n\\n     Under the well-established standard of Jackson v. Virginia,\\n\\n443 U.S. 307\\n (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979), this Court deter-\\n\\nmines whether evidence is sufficient as a matter of constitutional\\n\\ndue process by examining whether “any rational trier of fact could\\n\\nhave found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt.” \\nId. at 319\\n (III) (A) (emphasis in original). The United States\\n\\nSupreme Court has also recently indicated that, consistent with\\n\\nJackson, sufficiency review under this legal standard may include\\n\\nsomething more than only looking at the elements of the crime:\\n\\n     Sufficiency review essentially addresses whether the gov-\\n     ernment’s case was so lacking that it should not have even\\n     been submitted to the jury. On sufficiency review, a re-\\n     viewing court makes a limited inquiry tailored to ensure\\n     that a defendant receives the minimum that due process\\n     requires: a “meaningful opportunity to defend against the\\n     charge against him and a jury finding of guilt beyond a\\n     reasonable doubt.”\\n\\nMusacchio v. United States, \\n577 U.S. 237\\n, 243 (II) (136 SCt 709, 193\\n\\nLE2d 639) (2016) (quoting Jackson, \\n443 U.S. at 314-15\\n; other cita-\\n\\ntion and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n                                 37\\n      Here, the State elected to allege in Count 1 of the indictment\\n\\nthat in violation of OCGA § 16-5-1 (a), McCullum “did with malice\\n\\naforethought cause the death of Monica Blackwell, a human being,\\n\\nby cocaine intoxication in a manner unknown to the Grand Jury and\\n\\ndumping her without medical assistance on the side of the road.”\\n\\nMcCullum defended against this charge at trial by moving for a di-\\n\\nrected verdict of acquittal on the grounds that the State had failed\\n\\nto present any evidence to support the causation element alleged in\\n\\nthe indictment—that McCullum had anything to do with drugging\\n\\nBlackwell. It is now clear from the record that the motion should\\n\\nhave been granted. However, despite the lack of evidence supporting\\n\\nthis causation allegation, the Court has now affirmed the malice\\n\\nmurder conviction on sufficiency grounds on a different theory—that\\n\\nMcCullum beat and raped Blackwell and left her by the side of the\\n\\nroad to die—and has concluded that these facts sufficiently sup-\\n\\nported the statutory elements of the crime of malice murder.\\n\\n     I have serious concerns about the due process implications of\\n\\n\\n\\n                                38\\n such an approach. 14 Moreover, in addressing a different question re-\\n\\nlated to sufficiency analysis, the Musacchio Court left open several\\n\\nmatters, including whether sufficiency should be evaluated based on\\n\\nwhat has been alleged in the indictment: “we express no view on the\\n\\nquestion whether sufficiency of the evidence at trial must be judged\\n\\nby reference to the elements charged in the indictment, even if the\\n\\nindictment charges one or more elements not required by statute.”\\n\\nId. at 244, n.2. The Court has now decided to answer this difficult\\n\\nopen question without analysis, relying on the “elements” language\\n\\nin the Jackson test. However, I would follow two lines of authority\\n\\nfrom our Court that have addressed similar sufficiency arguments\\n\\nbut without deciding which line controls. Under either, I would re-\\n\\nverse the malice murder conviction and remand the case to the trial\\n\\ncourt to resentence on one of the felony murder convictions, which\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      14 Under the Court’s reasoning, the State could prosecute someone for\\n\\nmalice murder by shooting and prove the case by any other means such as\\npoisoning or stabbing, and the evidence would be sufficient as a matter of con-\\nstitutional due process because the statutory elements of malice murder would\\nbe satisfied, notwithstanding that the defendant may have a separate claim\\nbased on a fatal variance theory.\\n                                      39\\n had previously been vacated as a matter of law, and potentially on\\n\\nthe rape conviction pertaining to Blackwell. For these reasons, I re-\\n\\nspectfully dissent in part to the Court’s opinion. 15\\n\\n      1.    Count 1: Malice Murder\\n\\n      Relying on how the State alleged malice murder in the indict-\\n\\nment, McCullum contends that the evidence was insufficient be-\\n\\ncause the State failed to produce any evidence that McCullum sup-\\n\\nplied or was in any way involved in Blackwell’s ingestion of the co-\\n\\ncaine.16 The State argues that the other-acts evidence of McCullum’s\\n\\nattacks of women showed that McCullum would beat, restrain, or\\n\\nincapacitate his victims, 17 and since McCullum was seen with Black-\\n\\nwell two days before she was found, the jury could have inferred that\\n\\nhe used cocaine to incapacitate Blackwell. My review of the record\\n\\nshows that the only evidence presented at trial on this issue was Dr.\\n\\n\\n\\n      15 I fully concur in the remainder of the Court’s opinion.\\n      16 The Court has rejected this argument, describing it as a “novel theory\\n\\nof sufficiency.” (Maj. Op. at 19 n.7.) However, as explained below, this type of\\nsufficiency argument relying on the allegations of the indictment has been con-\\nsidered by our Court and federal appellate courts in multiple cases.\\n       17 It does not appear from our record that McCullum drugged any of the\\n\\nother women he attacked.\\n                                       40\\n Gowitt’s testimony that he did not have “any idea how the cocaine\\n\\ngot in [Blackwell’s] system,” speculating that it could have been ei-\\n\\nther voluntary or involuntary and that there was simply no way for\\n\\nhim to know.18 And I would reject the State’s argument that a jury\\n\\nis authorized to infer from the other-acts evidence that McCullum\\n\\nused cocaine to incapacitate Blackwell, because that evidence,\\n\\nthough bearing many similarities to Blackwell’s attack, did not in-\\n\\nvolve drugging the victims. Thus, McCullum is correct that the evi-\\n\\ndence at trial did not show that he caused Blackwell’s cocaine intox-\\n\\nication.\\n\\n      Although the Court asserts that such an approach to McCul-\\n\\nlum’s sufficiency claim is “novel” and an extension of Jackson, we\\n\\nhave held in cases before and after Mussachio was issued that when\\n\\nthe State elects to charge a crime under a particular theory of pros-\\n\\necution, “we cannot affirm a conviction based upon a legal theory of\\n\\n\\n      18 I note that even if there was evidence that Blackwell’s cocaine intoxi-\\n\\ncation was involuntary, which would permit the jury to infer that she was mur-\\ndered by involuntary or forced intoxication, that still would not authorize the\\njury to infer that McCullum was the person who intoxicated her, absent some\\nevidence showing that it was him.\\n                                      41\\n the crime with which the defendant was never charged.” Walker v.\\n\\nState, \\n296 Ga. 161\\n, 167 n.12 (1) (c) (\\n766 SE2d 28\\n) (2014) (evidence\\n\\nnot sufficient to support felony murder of child predicated on murder\\n\\nof mother when the State theorized that the murder of the mother\\n\\ncaused the death of the child by being unable to come to the aid of\\n\\nthe child when the defendant asphyxiated the child with his hand);\\n\\nsee Harrington v. State, \\n300 Ga. 574\\n, 577-78 (2) (a) (\\n797 SE2d 107\\n)\\n\\n(2017) (where indictment alleged that defendant committed armed\\n\\nrobbery by “unlawfully taking a cell phone from the immediate pres-\\n\\nence of [the victim], by use of a handgun,” the State was required to\\n\\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant used the handgun\\n\\nto take the cell phone prior to or contemporaneously with the taking\\n\\n(punctuation omitted)).19 Because the State presented no evidence\\n\\n\\n      19 The Court distinguishes Harrington and Walker as sufficiency deci-\\n\\nsions that have looked to the indictment, “only to determine which crime was\\ncharged.” (Maj. Op. at 17.) While it is true that these cases looked at the in-\\ndictment to determine which crime was charged, the analysis did not end there.\\nBoth cases looked at the specific allegations of the indictment and the manner\\nin which essential elements of the crime were charged in order to evaluate suf-\\nficiency of the evidence. See Harrington, \\n300 Ga. at 577\\n (concluding that State\\nfailed to support that cell phone was taken from the \"immediate presence\" of\\nthe victim \"by the use of a handgun\" as alleged in the indictment); Walker, 296\\n\\n                                      42\\n linking McCullum to cocaine whatsoever, much less to the cocaine\\n\\nin Blackwell’s system, under this line of cases, the evidence is legally\\n\\ninsufficient as a matter of constitutional due process to sustain\\n\\nMcCullum’s conviction on Count 1, the malice murder of Blackwell,\\n\\nas charged in the indictment.\\n\\n      However, in other cases, this Court has reviewed similar chal-\\n\\nlenges, including a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, as in\\n\\nactuality a claim that the evidence at trial fatally varied from the\\n\\nallegations of the indictment. For example, in Lebis v. State, \\n302 Ga.\\n\\n750\\n, 759-60 (II) (B) (\\n808 SE2d 724\\n) (2017), we noted that “Lebis\\n\\nraised sufficiency of the evidence rather than a ‘fatal variance’ be-\\n\\ntween the language of the indictment, which charged joint posses-\\n\\nsion, and the proof at trial,” yet the Court went on to analyze the\\n\\nclaim as a fatal variance issue. Also, in Mathews v. State, \\n314 Ga.\\n\\n360\\n, 365 (2) (\\n877 SE2d 188\\n) (2022), we summarized the appellant’s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGa. at 166 (holding that State failed to prove felony murder predicated on the\\nfelony alleged in the indictment even though the evidence supported a feloni-\\nous assault on the victim that caused his death).\\n\\n                                     43\\n arguments “that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to\\n\\ndeviate from the allegation in the indictment and offer proof that he\\n\\ncommitted the crimes in an uncharged manner” and “that the evi-\\n\\ndence at trial and the court’s instructions to the jury on party to a\\n\\ncrime allowed him to be convicted for merely helping co-defendant\\n\\nJackson, while the indictment specifically charged him with directly\\n\\ncommitting the crimes,” and then stated “[w]e interpret [his] argu-\\n\\nment as raising [a] fatal variance [claim].” Id; see Brown v. State,\\n\\n307 Ga. 24\\n, 27-28 (1) (\\n834 SE2d 40\\n) (2019) (summarizing test for\\n\\nfatal variance claim).\\n\\n     One difference between a fatal variance claim and a claim for\\n\\ninsufficiency of the evidence is that a fatal variance claim is an error\\n\\nthat must be asserted at trial and ruled upon to be preserved for\\n\\nappellate review. See Hughes v. State, \\n310 Ga. 453\\n, 456 (2) n.5 (\\n851\\n\\nSE2d 580\\n) (2020); Eberhart v. State, \\n307 Ga. 254\\n, 262 n.7 (2) (a) (\\n835\\n\\nSE2d 192\\n) (2019); Davis v. State, \\n301 Ga. 397\\n, 402 (4) (\\n801 SE2d 897\\n)\\n\\n(2017). Compare Jeffries v. State, \\n272 Ga. 510\\n, 512 (5) (\\n530 SE2d\\n\\n714\\n) (2000) (citing OCGA § 5-6-36 (a) to support that the defendant\\n\\n                                  44\\n “is simply incorrect that the failure to move for a directed verdict at\\n\\nthe close of the evidence precludes [the defendant] from contending\\n\\non appellate review that the evidence is insufficient to support the\\n\\nverdict”). Here, after the State rested, McCullum “move[d] for a di-\\n\\nrected verdict of acquittal as to Counts 1 through 4. That is the Mal-\\n\\nice Murder, Count 1, of Monica Blackwell did cause the death by\\n\\nmalice aforethought by cocaine intoxication and by dumping her\\n\\nwithout medical assistance. . . .” In making that argument, he never\\n\\nexplicitly raised or argued the term “fatal variance,” but his argu-\\n\\nment included, inter alia, that “[w]e have no evidence or testimony\\n\\nthat Mr. McCullum in any way caused [Blackwell] or forced her, di-\\n\\nrected her to ingest cocaine. That was the cause of death.”20 The trial\\n\\ncourt ruled “I believe there is sufficient evidence to go to the jury. I\\n\\nwould deny the motion to dismiss at this time, or a motion for direct\\n\\nverdict.”\\n\\n     Thus, if I were to analyze this claim as one asserting a fatal\\n\\n\\n     20 McCullum’s primary argument for a directed verdict was that “there\\n\\nis essentially no evidence that he caused the death and raped her in Count 1\\nthrough 4.”\\n                                    45\\n variance, the procedural posture of this claim would require consid-\\n\\neration of whether the trial court erred in denying the motion for a\\n\\ndirected verdict of acquittal on the malice murder count, even\\n\\nthough McCullum did not enumerate as error the denial of his mo-\\n\\ntion for a directed verdict. See Adams v. State, \\n288 Ga. 695\\n, 699 (2)\\n\\n(\\n707 SE2d 359\\n) (2011) (rejecting claim that trial court erred in deny-\\n\\ning motion for directed verdict asserting that the State failed to\\n\\nprove that the offenses occurred within the dates alleged in the in-\\n\\ndictment); Felder v. State, \\n270 Ga. 641\\n, 643 (2) (\\n514 SE2d 416\\n) (1999)\\n\\n(holding that trial court correctly denied motion for a directed ver-\\n\\ndict of acquittal when “the evidence is sufficient to show that the\\n\\ncigarettes were taken from the person of the victim as alleged in the\\n\\nindictment”). As explained above, the State failed to produce any ev-\\n\\nidence supporting that McCullum supplied or otherwise caused\\n\\nBlackwell’s cocaine intoxication. Accordingly, I would conclude that\\n\\nthe trial court erred in denying the motion for a directed verdict. See\\n\\nEllington v. State, \\n314 Ga. 335\\n, 339 (2) (\\n877 SE2d 221\\n) (2022) (“The\\n\\nstandard of review for the denial of a motion for a directed verdict of\\n\\n                                  46\\n acquittal is the same as for determining the sufficiency of the evi-\\n\\ndence to support the conviction.”) (citation omitted); Fitts v. State,\\n\\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 141 (3) (\\n859 SE2d 79\\n) (2021) (explaining that “‘[t]he\\n\\nstandard of review for the denial of a motion for a directed verdict of\\n\\nacquittal is the same as for determining the sufficiency of the evi-\\n\\ndence to support a conviction’”) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     Because McCullum moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on\\n\\nthe malice murder charge on the same grounds that he now asserts\\n\\non appeal and, as a result, under either line of cases, the malice mur-\\n\\nder conviction must be reversed, I would conclude that it is unnec-\\n\\nessary for this Court to determine whether his claim should be ana-\\n\\nlyzed as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process or whether his claim is in actuality that\\n\\nthe evidence at trial fatally varied from the allegation that McCul-\\n\\nlum caused Blackwell’s death by cocaine intoxication.\\n\\n     This approach is preferable for several reasons. First, it recog-\\n\\nnizes that although Mussachio referenced the familiar Jackson test\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  47\\n relying on the elements of the crime, it also went further and ex-\\n\\nplained what minimum due process requires in this context—“that\\n\\na defendant receives . . . a meaningful opportunity to defend against\\n\\nthe charge against him.” Musacchio, 577 U.S. at 243 (II). It is un-\\n\\nclear how this language is applied because Mussachio explicitly left\\n\\nopen the question of whether the allegations of the indictment factor\\n\\ninto the analysis, but it is difficult to discern how to evaluate “a\\n\\nmeaningful opportunity to defend against the charge” without some\\n\\nreference to the allegations of the indictment.\\n\\n      Second, although this issue remains an open question that the\\n\\nUnited States Supreme Court has recognized but not decided, this\\n\\nCourt has gone ahead and decided it. Yet, federal appellate courts\\n\\nwho have considered the issue have declined to decide it, indicating\\n\\nthat the answer is not as straightforward as the Court thinks it is.21\\n\\nInstead, in almost every one of those cases, the federal court has\\n\\n\\n      21 Although not binding on us, the decisions of federal appellate courts\\n\\nare persuasive, particularly on matters of federal constitutional law. See El-\\nliott v. State, \\n305 Ga. 179\\n, 187 (II) (B) (\\n824 SE2d 265\\n) (2019) (“The construction\\nof similar federal constitutional provisions, though persuasive authority, is not\\nbinding on this state’s construction of its own Constitution.”) (cleaned up).\\n                                       48\\n assumed without deciding that the allegations of the indictment\\n\\nwere essential in evaluating sufficiency.22 See United States v.

Here, all Justices\\nagree that causation is an essential element of malice murder although there\\nis disagreement on whether the manner in which causation is alleged is part\\nof the essential elements of the crime.\\n                                       50\\n       For these reasons, I conclude that it is unnecessary to decide\\n\\nthis difficult open question of federal constitutional law. Instead, I\\n\\nwould rely on the ample authority from our Court in evaluating\\n\\nMcCullum’s sufficiency argument while finding it unnecessary to de-\\n\\ncide which line of authority controls and reverse McCullum’s convic-\\n\\ntion for malice murder.\\n\\n      2.    Counts 2 and 3: Felony Murder\\n\\n      Because I would reverse the malice murder conviction, McCul-\\n\\nlum’s felony murder convictions would no longer stand vacated as a\\n\\nmatter of law. See Clough v. State, \\n298 Ga. 594\\n, 597-98 (2) (\\n783 SE2d\\n\\n637\\n) (2016); Wallace v. State, \\n275 Ga. 879\\n, 881 (2) (\\n572 SE2d 579\\n)\\n\\n(2002), disapproved on other grounds by Willis v. State, \\n304 Ga. 686\\n,\\n\\n706 (11) (a) n.3 (\\n820 SE2d 640\\n) (2018). Thus, I will also address his\\n\\nchallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to support those convic-\\n\\ntions as well. 24\\n\\n\\n      24 In so doing, I note that in addition to arguing that the evidence to\\n\\nsupport these convictions was constitutionally insufficient, McCullum also\\ncites OCGA § 24-14-6 and argues that the evidence was wholly circumstantial\\nand does not exclude what he characterizes as the reasonable hypothesis that\\n\\n                                     51\\n         Count 2 of the indictment alleges that McCullum caused the\\n\\ndeath of Blackwell “in the commission of the offense of rape, a fel-\\n\\nony,” and Count 3 of the indictment alleges that he caused her death\\n\\n“in the commission of the offense of Aggravated Assault with the\\n\\nintent to Rape, a felony.” “A person commits the offense of murder,\\n\\nwhen, in the commission of a felony, he or she causes the death of\\n\\nanother human being irrespective of malice.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (c). “A\\n\\nperson commits the offense of rape when he has carnal knowledge\\n\\nof: . . . [a] female forcibly and against her will.” OCGA § 16-6-1 (a).\\n\\nAnd “[a] person commits the offense of aggravated assault when he\\n\\n.   .     .   assaults: 25     [w]ith        intent   .   .    .    to    rape.”\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-21 (a) (1).\\n\\n        Here, for felony murder predicated on rape, the State was re-\\n\\nquired to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that McCullum caused\\n\\n\\nMcCullum had consensual sex with Blackwell. See OCGA § 24-14-6 (“To war-\\nrant a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the proved facts shall not only be\\nconsistent with the hypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude every other reasona-\\nble hypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.”).\\n      25 An assault consists of the “[a]ttempt[] to commit a violent injury to the\\n\\nperson of another” or the commission of “an act which places another in rea-\\nsonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury.” OCGA § 16-\\n5-20 (a).\\n                                        52\\n Blackwell’s death in the commission of raping her and that the rape\\n\\nproximately caused Blackwell’s death. See Eubanks v. State, \\n317 Ga.\\n\\n563\\n, 567-78 (2) (\\n894 SE2d 27\\n) (2023); State v. Jackson, \\n287 Ga. 646\\n,\\n\\n660 (6) (\\n697 SE2d 757\\n) (2010). The State was likewise required to\\n\\nprove the same elements with respect to the felony murder predi-\\n\\ncated on aggravated assault with the intent to rape. \\nId.\\n Proximate\\n\\ncause requires “that the death actually happened in a way that was\\n\\na reasonably foreseeable result of the criminal conduct—that is, the\\n\\ndeath must also have been a probable or natural consequence of the\\n\\ncriminal conduct.” Eubanks, 317 Ga. at 569 (2) (a) (ii) (cleaned up;\\n\\nemphasis in original). See also Jackson, \\n287 Ga. at 652\\n (2), 654 (3)\\n\\n(“Proximate causation imposes liability for the reasonably foreseea-\\n\\nble results of criminal . . . conduct if there is no sufficient, independ-\\n\\nent, and unforeseen intervening cause,” and proximate cause exists\\n\\nif the predicate felonious conduct “directly and materially contrib-\\n\\nuted to the happening of a subsequent accruing immediate cause of\\n\\nthe death,” or if “the homicide was committed within the res gestae\\n\\nof the felony and is one of the incidental, probable consequences of\\n\\n                                   53\\n the execution of the design to commit” the predicate felony (citations\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, the ev-\\n\\nidence presented at trial was constitutionally sufficient to authorize\\n\\na jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that McCullum assaulted\\n\\nand raped Blackwell and sufficient under Georgia statutory law to\\n\\nreject as unreasonable the hypothesis that Blackwell consented to\\n\\nhaving sex with McCullum. That evidence included that McCullum\\n\\nwas the last person seen with Blackwell before she was found beaten\\n\\nup and dumped on the side of the road, half naked, and with his\\n\\nsperm in her vagina. See Johnson v. State, \\n307 Ga. 44\\n, 48 (2) (a) (\\n834\\n\\nSE2d 83\\n) (2019) (circumstantial evidence, including that defendant\\n\\nwas the last person seen with the victim before his death, was suffi-\\n\\ncient to support murder conviction); Lewis v. State, \\n306 Ga. 455\\n, 457,\\n\\n459 (1) (a) (\\n831 SE2d 771\\n) (2019) (evidence which included that vic-\\n\\ntim’s body was discovered partially undressed, had defensive\\n\\nwounds, and had defendant’s sperm in her vagina was sufficient to\\n\\nsustain his convictions for murder and rape, and authorized jury to\\n\\n                                 54\\n reject his alternate hypothesis as unreasonable); Daniels v. State,\\n\\n298 Ga. 120\\n, 123 (1) (\\n779 SE2d 640\\n) (2015) (evidence including the\\n\\nstate in which victim’s body was discovered, DNA evidence linking\\n\\ndefendant to victim, and evidence of prior similarly violent sexual\\n\\nconduct by defendant “were sufficient to support the jury’s conclu-\\n\\nsion that [defendant] assaulted, raped, and murdered [victim]”);\\n\\nWalker v. State, \\n282 Ga. 406\\n, 408 (1) (\\n651 SE2d 12\\n) (2007) (evidence,\\n\\nwhich included the state in which victim’s body was discovered and\\n\\nDNA evidence linking defendant to victim, was sufficient to support\\n\\njury’s conclusion that defendant raped and murdered victim, and\\n\\nauthorized jury to reject defendant’s alternate hypotheses).\\n\\n     Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to authorize the jury to\\n\\nfind beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravated assault and/or\\n\\nrape proximately caused Blackwell’s death. Because there is nothing\\n\\nimprobable or unnatural about a death occurring as the result of a\\n\\nviolent beating and sexual assault that ended with the victim being\\n\\nleft for dead, Blackwell’s death was a reasonably foreseeable result\\n\\nof the aggravated assault and rape. To that end, Dr. Gowitt testified\\n\\n                                 55\\n that any beating and rape sustained by Blackwell “absolutely” con-\\n\\ntributed to her death. That Dr. Gowitt listed Blackwell’s ultimate\\n\\ncause of death as acute cocaine intoxication does not change the con-\\n\\nclusion that McCullum’s assault and rape of Blackwell proximately\\n\\ncaused her death because evidence was presented that showed that\\n\\nthe beating and rape by McCullum, along with his dumping of her\\n\\non the roadside without medical assistance, materially contributed\\n\\nto and accelerated her death, which is sufficient to show that McCul-\\n\\nlum’s felonious conduct caused her death. See Stribling v. State, \\n304\\n\\nGa. 250\\n, 253-54 (1) (\\n818 SE2d 563\\n) (2018); see also Virger v. State,\\n\\n305 Ga. 281\\n, 289 (3) (\\n824 SE2d 346\\n) (2019) (evidence sufficient for\\n\\njury to find that by allowing victim to suffer rather than promptly\\n\\nseeking medical aid, defendant proximately caused victim’s death).\\n\\n     In sum, I would conclude that the evidence presented at trial\\n\\nwas constitutionally sufficient to authorize the jury to find beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt that McCullum caused Blackwell’s death in the\\n\\ncommission of his assault and rape of her and was therefore guilty\\n\\nof Count 2, felony murder predicated on rape, and Count 3, felony\\n\\n                                 56\\n murder predicated on aggravated assault with intent to rape. Be-\\n\\ncause, as discussed above, Counts 2 and 3 would no longer be va-\\n\\ncated by operation of law and the evidence would be constitutionally\\n\\nsufficient to support those charges, I would vacate that portion of\\n\\nthe trial court’s final disposition that had vacated Counts 2 and 3 as\\n\\na matter of law and remand this case for sentencing in accordance\\n\\nwith the law. In so doing, I would remind the trial court that alt-\\n\\nhough McCullum was found guilty on both counts of felony murder,\\n\\none predicated on his rape of Blackwell and the other on his aggra-\\n\\nvated assault of her, he cannot be sentenced on both those counts\\n\\nbecause there was only one victim. See Noel v. State, \\n297 Ga. 698\\n,\\n\\n700 (2) (\\n777 SE2d 449\\n) (2015) (“[A] defendant found guilty of the\\n\\nfelony murder of the same victim through the commission of more\\n\\nthan one felony may only be sentenced on one felony murder charge\\n\\nand the remaining felony murder charges stand vacated by opera-\\n\\ntion of law.”); Warren v. State, \\n283 Ga. 42\\n, 44 (4) n.2 (\\n656 SE2d 803\\n)\\n\\n(2008) (same). Moreover, “[i]n cases like this one, where a defendant\\n\\nis found guilty on multiple counts of felony murder against the same\\n\\n                                 57\\n victim, the decision as to which of the felony murder verdicts should\\n\\nbe deemed vacated—a decision that may affect which other verdicts\\n\\nmerge and thus what other sentences may be imposed–is left to the\\n\\ndiscretion of the trial court.” Hinton v. State, \\n304 Ga. 605\\n, 608 (3)\\n\\n(\\n820 SE2d 712\\n) (2018) (citation and punctuation omitted); see also\\n\\nCowart v. State, \\n294 Ga. 333\\n, 336 (2) (\\n751 SE2d 399\\n) (2013).\\n\\n     3.   Count 4: Rape of Blackwell.\\n\\n     As the above discussion makes clear, the evidence presented at\\n\\ntrial authorized the jury to find McCullum guilty beyond a reasona-\\n\\nble doubt of raping Blackwell. Nonetheless, the trial court would\\n\\nhave the discretion to decide which felony murder verdict it would\\n\\nenter a conviction and sentence upon and which one would be va-\\n\\ncated by operation of law, and that decision “may affect which other\\n\\nverdicts merge and thus what other sentences may be imposed.”\\n\\nHinton, 304 Ga. at 608 (3) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     [I]f, in exercising that discretion, the trial court elects to\\n     sentence the defendant on a felony murder count predi-\\n     cated on one crime, then it must also sentence him on any\\n     remaining crime that served as a predicate to a vacated\\n     felony murder count when the other crime does not merge\\n\\n                                  58\\n      with the felony murder conviction on which a sentence\\n     was entered.\\n\\nId. at 608-09 (3); see also Davis v. State, \\n301 Ga. 397\\n, 404 (5) n.7 (\\n801\\n\\nSE2d 897\\n) (2017); Stewart v. State, \\n299 Ga. 622\\n, 627-28 (3) (\\n791\\n\\nSE2d 61\\n) (2016); Leeks v. State, \\n296 Ga. 515\\n, 523-24 (7) (\\n769 SE2d\\n\\n296\\n) (2015). Cf. Steele v. State, \\n317 Ga. 411\\n, 414 (2) (\\n893 SE2d 721\\n)\\n\\n(2023) (“When the only murder conviction is for felony murder and\\n\\na defendant is convicted of both felony murder and the predicate fel-\\n\\nony of the felony murder charge, the conviction for the predicate fel-\\n\\nony merges into the felony murder conviction.” (citation and punc-\\n\\ntuation omitted)). See also OCGA § 16-1-7 (a) (1) (“When the same\\n\\nconduct of an accused may establish the commission of more than\\n\\none crime,” the accused may not “be convicted of more than one\\n\\ncrime if . . . [o]ne crime is included in the other[.]”).\\n\\n     Because the trial court would have the discretion to decide\\n\\nwhether to enter a conviction and sentence on Count 2 (felony mur-\\n\\nder predicated on rape) or on Count 3 (felony murder predicated on\\n\\naggravated assault with intent to rape), and because that decision\\n\\n\\n                                    59\\n will impact the merger analysis on Count 4 (rape), I would also va-\\n\\ncate the conviction and sentence on Count 4 for the trial court to\\n\\nconsider on remand the proper final disposition of Count 4 in light\\n\\nof its sentencing decision on the felony murder counts. 26 See Parrott\\n\\nv. State, \\n312 Ga. 580\\n, 583 n.4 (3) (\\n864 SE2d 80\\n) (2021) (explaining\\n\\nthat in similar cases, we have declined to establish “a policy of ap-\\n\\npellate sentencing” and that we instead remand them for trial courts\\n\\n“to exercise [their] discretion in resentencing” (citation and punctu-\\n\\nation omitted)); Noel, \\n297 Ga. at 700\\n (2) (remanding for resentenc-\\n\\ning, and reminding the trial court that “on resentencing, a legal con-\\n\\nviction may be entered on only one felony murder verdict, [that] the\\n\\nunderlying felony charged in that count will merge into the felony\\n\\nmurder conviction as a matter of law” depending on which felony\\n\\nmurder conviction was entered, that “the remaining felony murder\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      26 The law is clear that if the trial court were to elect to enter a conviction\\n\\nand sentence on felony murder predicated on rape, the rape conviction would\\nmerge.

HENDERSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        ELLINGTON, Justice.\\n\\n        A DeKalb County jury found Gavin Henderson (“Henderson”)\\n\\nguilty of malice murder, cruelty to children in the first degree, and\\n\\npossession of a knife during the commission of a felony in connection\\n\\nwith the fatal stabbing of his sister, Kiara Henderson. 1 Henderson\\n\\ncontends the trial court erred in admitting prior-acts evidence,\\n\\n\\n        1On September 11, 2018, a DeKalb County grand jury indicted\\nHenderson for malice murder (Count 1); felony murder (Counts 2-3);\\naggravated assault (Count 4); cruelty to children in the first degree (Counts 5\\nand 7); and possession of a knife during the commission of a felony (Count 6).\\nFollowing a jury trial that ended on July 9, 2021, the jury found Henderson\\nguilty on all counts. On that same date, the court sentenced Henderson to life\\nin prison without the possibility of parole for malice murder; 20 years in prison\\nfor cruelty to children in the first degree (consecutive to Count 1); five years in\\nprison for possession of a knife during the commission of a felony (consecutive\\nto Count 5); and 20 years in prison for cruelty to children in the first degree\\n(consecutive to Count 6). The felony murder counts were vacated by operation\\nof law, and the aggravated assault count merged with the malice murder count.\\nHenderson filed a motion for a new trial on August 3, 2021, and new counsel\\namended it on June 1, 2023. Following a hearing held on June 21, 2023, the\\ntrial court denied the motion for a new trial on July 10, 2023. Henderson filed\\na notice of appeal on July 12, 2023. The case was docketed in this Court to the\\nterm beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n failing to charge the jury on the law of voluntary manslaughter, and\\n\\ncommitting cumulative errors that require reversal. Because\\n\\nHenderson’s claims of error are without merit, we affirm the trial\\n\\ncourt’s order denying Henderson’s motion for a new trial.\\n\\n     The evidence adduced at trial shows the following. In June\\n\\n2018, 27-year-old Henderson lived in the Lacota Apartments in\\n\\nDeKalb County with his mother, Trayshelle Henderson, and his\\n\\nthree siblings, 21-year-old Ceaira Henderson, 15-year-old Kiara,\\n\\nand 11-year-old Z. G. On June 18, Trayshelle and Ceaira left for\\n\\nwork, leaving Kiara and Z. G. at home with Henderson. That\\n\\nafternoon, Henderson went to use the only bathroom in the\\n\\napartment, but Kiara was in it. When Kiara did not leave the\\n\\nbathroom immediately, the siblings argued. Z. G., who was in a\\n\\nnearby bedroom, heard the argument.\\n\\n     As Henderson tried to force the bathroom door open, he wedged\\n\\na clipboard (to which his cell phone was attached) between the door\\n\\nand the door frame. Kiara pushed the door closed, which knocked\\n\\nHenderson’s cell phone to the floor, damaging it. When Kiara left\\n\\n                                 2\\n the bathroom, the argument with Henderson escalated. Henderson\\n\\ntold the police that, at some point during the argument, he went to\\n\\nhis bedroom to retrieve a knife. Z. G. heard the argument and heard\\n\\nKiara threaten to call their mother; Kiara called her sister, Ceaira,\\n\\ninstead and told her that Henderson had hit her. Z. G. then heard\\n\\nKiara scream, so she left her room to see what was happening. Z. G.\\n\\nfollowed the sound of screaming to the apartment’s front door.\\n\\n     When Z. G. peered outside to the apartment’s breezeway, she\\n\\nsaw Henderson striking Kiara in the abdomen with a “black metal\\n\\nthing.” Z. G. yelled for her brother to stop, then she called the police\\n\\nand her mother. Neighbors also called the police. The neighbors\\n\\nreported hearing screaming in the breezeway and Kiara knocking\\n\\non their doors for help. When officers responded to the apartment\\n\\ncomplex, they found Kiara lying on the breezeway floor. Her body\\n\\nwas covered in stab wounds, and she was surrounded by large pools\\n\\nof blood.\\n\\n     Officers also received a 911 call from the manager of a\\n\\nconvenience store located about a half mile from the apartment\\n\\n                                   3\\n complex. The store manager said that Henderson, who had walked\\n\\ninto his store covered in blood and holding a bloody knife, told the\\n\\nmanager to call the police because he had just “killed someone.”\\n\\nAfter the manager called the police, Henderson put the knife on the\\n\\nstore’s front counter and began wandering around inside the store.\\n\\nWhen Henderson heard the sirens of the approaching police cars, he\\n\\nwalked out of the store with his hands raised, surrendering.\\n\\n     As he was taken into custody, Henderson told the police to “just\\n\\ntake him straight to county” and that if anyone in jail tried to “mess[]\\n\\nwith him there, he would kill them, too.” Officers retrieved the\\n\\nbloody knife – an all-black Bowie hunting knife with a 10-inch-long\\n\\nblade – from the store. Officers took Henderson to the precinct,\\n\\nwhere he later waived his Miranda rights and agreed to be\\n\\ninterviewed. When the interviewing detective informed Henderson\\n\\nthat his sister did not survive, he responded: “Thank God.”\\n\\nHenderson went on to tell the detective that he had “blacked out”\\n\\nand was “in a trance” during the stabbing; however, he recounted in\\n\\ndetail events leading up to and following the stabbing. He said that\\n\\n                                   4\\n Kiara threw a glass bottle at him during their argument and that\\n\\nwhen Z. G. called his name, he came out of his trance. Photographs\\n\\nof the scene admitted at trial showed an unbroken bottle on the floor.\\n\\n     The medical examiner documented 47 major stab wounds\\n\\ncovering Kiara’s entire body, including two to her face and several\\n\\non her back. The medical examiner testified that the wound pattern\\n\\nindicated that Kiara was stabbed with rapid, repetitive motions. The\\n\\nshape of some of the wounds also indicated that the blade had been\\n\\ntwisted while inside Kiara’s body, either from her movements or her\\n\\nassailant’s. The medical examiner also observed extensive defensive\\n\\nwounds to Kiara’s hands and legs. The cause of death was\\n\\ndetermined to be multiple stab wounds to the face, torso, and\\n\\nextremities. The manner of death was homicide.\\n\\n     The State also presented evidence through the testimony of\\n\\nCeaira and her mother that Henderson had violently attacked\\n\\nCeaira a few months prior to the attack against Kiara. Ceaira\\n\\ntestified that, after she had apparently offended Henderson by\\n\\nignoring him, he argued with her, punched her, threw her to the\\n\\n                                  5\\n floor, and then left the room briefly. When he returned, he was\\n\\nholding a black hunting knife. Ceaira went to her bedroom and tried\\n\\nto call her mother, but Henderson followed her, took her phone, and\\n\\nput the knife to her face. Henderson then told Ceaira to “call the\\n\\npolice, he was ready to go.” When Ceaira started crying, Henderson\\n\\nleft the apartment.\\n\\n     Trayshelle returned to the apartment when Ceaira called her\\n\\nand told her that Henderson had attacked her. When Trayshelle\\n\\nlearned what had happened, she called Henderson back to the\\n\\napartment and told him that Ceaira could press charges against\\n\\nhim. Henderson, who was holding the knife he had used to threaten\\n\\nCeaira, started “raging.” Trayshelle took the knife from him and told\\n\\nhim he could not be in the house with a weapon. She hid his knife,\\n\\nas well as the kitchen knives, in her bedroom closet.\\n\\n     1. Henderson contends that the trial court erred by admitting\\n\\nevidence of the previous “unrelated altercation” between Henderson\\n\\nand his sister Ceaira pursuant to OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (“Rule 404\\n\\n(b)”). Because evidence that Henderson had assaulted Ceaira with a\\n\\n                                 6\\n knife following a petty argument two months prior to the charged\\n\\noffense was admissible for purposes of proving Henderson’s intent,\\n\\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it. 2\\n\\n      “We review the trial court’s decision to admit evidence\\n\\npursuant to Rule 404 (b) for a clear abuse of discretion.” Hood v.\\n\\nState, \\n309 Ga. 493\\n, 499 (2) (\\n847 SE2d 172\\n) (2020). “Rule 404 (b) is a\\n\\nrule of inclusion, but it does prohibit the introduction of other acts\\n\\nevidence when it is offered for the sole purpose of showing a\\n\\ndefendant’s bad character or propensity to commit a crime.” Booth\\n\\nv. State, \\n301 Ga. 678\\n, 682 (3) (\\n804 SE2d 104\\n) (2017). Therefore, “[i]t\\n\\nis well established that other acts evidence is not admissible ‘to\\n\\nprove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Henderson also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in\\n\\nallowing the prior act evidence to be admitted for the purposes of showing\\nabsence of mistake or accident. However, before Trayshelle and Ceaira\\ntestified, the trial court noted that it had not heard anything during the\\npretrial motion-in-limine hearing demonstrating how the proffered evidence\\nwas relevant for the purposes of showing absence of mistake or accident;\\nconsequently, it ruled that the evidence would be admitted only for the purpose\\nof showing Henderson’s intent. The court gave the jury limiting instructions\\nconsistent with this ruling prior to both Trayshelle’s and Ceaira’s testimony.\\nThus, Henderson’s arguments on this point are not supported by the record\\nand are without merit.\\n                                      7\\n therewith,’” but “such evidence is admissible for other purposes,\\n\\nincluding ‘proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\\n\\nknowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.’” Hood, 309\\n\\nGa. at 499 (2) (quoting Rule 404 (b)).\\n\\n      A party offering evidence pursuant to Rule 404 (b) must\\n      demonstrate three things: (1) that the evidence is\\n      relevant to an issue in the case other than the defendant’s\\n      character; (2) that the evidence’s probative value is not\\n      substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice; and (3)\\n      that sufficient proof exists for a jury to find by a\\n      preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\\n      committed the other act.\\n\\nId.\\n\\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\\n\\nevidence for the purpose of proving intent. “Because [Henderson]\\n\\nentered a plea of not guilty, [he] made ‘intent a material issue, and\\n\\nthe State may prove intent by qualifying Rule 404 (b) evidence\\n\\nabsent affirmative steps by the defendant to remove intent as an\\n\\nissue.” Hood, 309 Ga. at 499-500 (2). “The relevance of other acts\\n\\nevidence offered to show intent is established when the prior act was\\n\\ncommitted with the same state of mind as the charged crime.”\\n\\n\\n                                  8\\n (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Id. at 500 (2). “Where the intent\\n\\nrequired for the charged offenses and other acts is the same, and\\n\\nintent is at issue, the first prong of the Rule 404 (b) test is satisfied.”\\n\\nBooth, \\n301 Ga. at 683\\n (3).\\n\\n     In this case, in addition to malice murder, Henderson was\\n\\ncharged in the indictment with committing an aggravated assault\\n\\nagainst Kiara by assaulting her and stabbing her with a knife, “an\\n\\nobject which when used offensively against a person did result in\\n\\nserious bodily injury.” See OCGA § 16-5-21 (a) (2) (“A person\\n\\ncommits the offense of aggravated assault when he . . . assaults . . .\\n\\n[w]ith a deadly weapon or with any object . . . which, when used\\n\\noffensively against a person, is likely to or actually does result in\\n\\nserious bodily injury[.]”).3 Henderson’s prior incident with Ceaira\\n\\nalso involved acts which would constitute an aggravated assault\\n\\nwith a knife, an “object . . . which, when used offensively against a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) defines a simple assault as when a person either:\\n\\n“(1) Attempts to commit a violent injury to the person of another; or (2)\\nCommits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of\\nimmediately receiving a violent injury.”\\n                                    9\\n person, is likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury.”\\n\\nId. The acts as alleged in the aggravated assault count of the\\n\\nindictment and the acts as testified to by Ceaira concerning the prior\\n\\nassault against her have in common the same general intent.\\n\\nAlthough aggravated assault can be charged in other ways that\\n\\nmake the offense a specific intent crime, the way it was charged here\\n\\nis a general intent crime, requiring proof only that Henderson had\\n\\nthe intent to (1) assault Kiara (2) with a knife, an object which, when\\n\\nused offensively against a person, is likely to or does result in serious\\n\\nbodily injury. See Booth, \\n301 Ga. at 684\\n (3). That Henderson\\n\\nintentionally assaulted another sister with a knife, a weapon which\\n\\nis likely to cause serious bodily injury, was relevant to show that he\\n\\ncommitted a similar act with the same sort of intent as alleged in\\n\\nthe instant indictment. Because the intent required for the prior act\\n\\nand the charged offense of aggravated assault is the same, the first\\n\\nprong of the Rule 404 (b) test was satisfied. \\nId. at 686\\n (3).\\n\\n     Having concluded that the other-acts evidence satisfies the\\n\\nfirst prong of the Rule 404 (b) test, we turn to the test’s second prong,\\n\\n                                   10\\n which is controlled by OCGA § 24-4-403 (“Rule 403”).\\n\\n     Rule 403 provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence\\n     where “its probative value is substantially outweighed by\\n     the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\\n     misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay,\\n     waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative\\n     evidence.” In other words, other acts evidence should be\\n     excluded if it constitutes matter of scant or cumulative\\n     probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its\\n     prejudicial effect. Factors to be considered in determining\\n     the probative value of other act evidence offered to prove\\n     intent include its overall similarity to the charged crime,\\n     its temporal remoteness, and the prosecutorial need for it.\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Hood, 309 Ga. at 500-501 (2).\\n\\n     We recognize that the other-acts evidence was certainly\\n\\nprejudicial to Henderson, given that he was not charged with any\\n\\ncrimes arising from his assault on Ceaira, which can increase the\\n\\nprejudicial impact of this evidence. See Hood v. State, 299 Ga. at 105\\n\\n(noting that the admission of other-acts evidence poses greater\\n\\ndanger where “the extrinsic activity was not the subject of a prior\\n\\nconviction” because “the jury may feel that the defendant should be\\n\\npunished for that activity even if he is not guilty of the offense\\n\\ncharged”). “But in a criminal trial, inculpatory evidence is\\n\\n\\n                                 11\\n inherently prejudicial; ‘it is only when unfair prejudice substantially\\n\\noutweighs probative value that the rule permits exclusion.’”\\n\\n(Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) Anglin v. State, \\n302 Ga.\\n\\n333\\n, 337 (3) (\\n806 SE2d 573\\n) (2017). “Rule 403’s exclusionary force is\\n\\nmeant to be applied sparingly – primarily when the other-acts\\n\\nevidence has scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the\\n\\nheels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.” (Citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted.) Hounkpatin v. State, \\n313 Ga. 789\\n, 796 (2) (a)\\n\\n(2022).\\n\\n     In this case, the prior-acts evidence was not required to be\\n\\nexcluded under Rule 403 because it was not substantially\\n\\noutweighed by unfair prejudice. The prosecutorial need was\\n\\nsignificant because Henderson claimed to have “blacked out” during\\n\\nthe aggravated assault. He also argued that Kiara provoked him by\\n\\nattacking him with a bottle. Thus, the State needed evidence from\\n\\nwhich the jury could infer that his acts were intentional rather than\\n\\ndefensive or committed while “blacked out” or “in a trance.” See\\n\\nHarrison v. State, \\n310 Ga. 862\\n, 868 (3) (\\n855 SE2d 546\\n) (2021).\\n\\n                                  12\\n Further, the prior-acts evidence had significant probative value in\\n\\nshowing Henderson’s criminal intent to violently assault his sister\\n\\nwith a deadly weapon. The similarity of the acts against Ceaira to\\n\\nthe charged crimes was strong – Henderson overreacted to petty\\n\\narguments with his sisters by assaulting both with a large hunting\\n\\nknife. Finally, the prior act was not temporally remote. The incident\\n\\nwith Ceaira occurred less than two months prior to the charged\\n\\ncrimes. Given the strong probative value of the evidence in showing\\n\\nHenderson’s intent and in rebutting any claim of self-defense, we see\\n\\nno abuse of discretion in the trial court’s ruling that the probative\\n\\nvalue of the other-acts evidence was not substantially outweighed\\n\\nby any unfair prejudice. See Harrison, 310 Ga. at 868 (3). “This is\\n\\nparticularly true given that the trial court instructed the jury, both\\n\\nprior to [Trayshelle’s and Ceaira’s] testimony and at the close of the\\n\\nevidence, that this evidence was to be considered only for the limited\\n\\npurposes for which it was admitted.” Id.\\n\\n     As to the third and final prong of the Rule 404 (b) test, Ceaira’s\\n\\nand Trayshelle’s testimony was sufficient to establish by a\\n\\n                                  13\\n preponderance of the evidence that Henderson did in fact commit\\n\\nthe acts about which they testified. Thus, we see no clear abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion in the trial court’s admission of the other-acts evidence.\\n\\nSee Harrison, 310 Ga. at 869 (3). This claim of error therefore fails.\\n\\n     2. Henderson contends the trial court erred in refusing to\\n\\ncharge the jury on the offense of voluntary manslaughter. Voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter is the killing of another person under circumstances\\n\\nthat would otherwise be murder when the killer “acts solely as the\\n\\nresult of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from\\n\\nserious provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable\\n\\nperson[.]” OCGA § 16-5-2 (a). 4 At trial, Henderson submitted a\\n\\nwritten request for a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 OCGA §16-5-2 (a) provides in full:\\n\\n     A person commits the offense of voluntary manslaughter when he\\n     causes the death of another human being under circumstances\\n     which would otherwise be murder and if he acts solely as the result\\n     of a sudden violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious\\n     provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable\\n     person; however, if there should have been an interval between the\\n     provocation and the killing sufficient for the voice of reason and\\n     humanity to be heard, of which the jury in all cases shall be the\\n     judge, the killing shall be attributed to deliberate revenge and be\\n     punished as murder.\\n                                     14\\n Following arguments made by the defense and prosecution during\\n\\nthe charge conference, the trial court denied Henderson’s request.\\n\\nAfter the jury was charged, Henderson renewed his objection.\\n\\nBecause there was no evidence that would support giving an\\n\\ninstruction on voluntary manslaughter, the trial court did not err in\\n\\ndenying the request.\\n\\n     “A trial court is required to grant a defendant’s request for a\\n\\ncharge on voluntary manslaughter if there is any evidence, however\\n\\nslight, supporting the theory of the charge.” O'Neal v. State, \\n316 Ga.\\n\\n264\\n, 267 (1) (a) (\\n888 SE2d 42\\n) (2023). “It is a question of law for\\n\\ncourts to determine whether the defendant has presented sufficient\\n\\nevidence to warrant a requested charge.” Hudson v. State, \\n308 Ga.\\n\\n443\\n, 445 (2) (\\n841 SE2d 696\\n) (2020). Although slight evidence will\\n\\nsupport giving the requested charge, “neither fear that someone is\\n\\ngoing to pull a weapon nor fighting are the types of provocation that\\n\\ndemand    a   voluntary   manslaughter     charge.”   (Citation   and\\n\\npunctuation omitted.) \\nId.\\n Further, “words alone are generally not\\n\\nsufficient provocation to excite the passion necessary to give rise to\\n\\n                                 15\\n voluntary manslaughter.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) \\nId.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, this Court has held that “the voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nstatute establishes an objective standard; the provocation required\\n\\nto mitigate malice is that which would arouse a heat of passion in a\\n\\nreasonable person.” (Citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis in\\n\\noriginal.) Watkins v. State, \\n313 Ga. 573\\n, 577 (2) (\\n872 SE2d 293\\n)\\n\\n(2022).\\n\\n     Henderson contends that the following evidence is sufficient to\\n\\nwarrant a charge on voluntary manslaughter: 15-year-old Kiara\\n\\nargued with Henderson about his efforts to oust her from the\\n\\nbathroom; when Henderson tried to force open the door, Kiara\\n\\ncaused his cell phone case to break; during the argument, Kiara\\n\\nthrew a bottle at him; and, Henderson believed Kiara was going to\\n\\nthe kitchen to get a knife with which to attack him, which is why he\\n\\ngot his own knife. He also contends that the “extreme” and “frenzied”\\n\\nnature of his conduct in stabbing Kiara 47 times in a public area\\n\\nsuggests that he was “not acting out of conscious deliberation, but\\n\\nrather out of intense anger or rage, which also would support a\\n\\n                                 16\\n voluntary manslaughter conviction.”\\n\\n     Although this evidence may have supported Henderson’s\\n\\nmotive for attacking Kiara, it is not sufficient as a matter of law to\\n\\nestablish the slight evidence required to support giving a charge on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter. The evidence does not show a “sudden,\\n\\nviolent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation\\n\\nsufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person.” OCGA §16-\\n\\n5-2 (a). That Henderson and Kiara argued prior to the stabbing\\n\\nabout access to the bathroom is not the type of provocation used to\\n\\nsupport voluntary manslaughter under Georgia law. Therefore, this\\n\\nheated exchange of words, without more, is insufficient provocation\\n\\nto warrant a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter. See Johnson\\n\\nv. State, \\n297 Ga. 839\\n, 844 (2) (\\n778 SE2d 769\\n) (2015) (“As a matter of\\n\\nlaw, angry statements alone ordinarily do not amount to ‘serious\\n\\nprovocation’ within the meaning of OCGA §16-5-2 (a).” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)). Nor was Kiara’s act of knocking a clipboard\\n\\nand cell phone out of Henderson’s hand the kind of act that would\\n\\nexcite the level of irresistible passion required under the law. See id.\\n\\n                                  17\\n at 842-844 (2). Further, there is no evidence that Kiara possessed or\\n\\nused a weapon against Henderson. Even if Kiara threw a bottle at\\n\\nHenderson and he acted to defend himself, “acting out of fear of\\n\\nbodily harm is not the same as acting in the heat of passion, and\\n\\nonly evidence of the latter supports a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nconviction.” Burke v. State, \\n302 Ga. 786\\n, 790-791 (2) (\\n809 SE2d 765\\n)\\n\\n(2018).\\n\\n     Because Henderson has not pointed to any evidence that 15-\\n\\nyear-old Kiara provided any serious provocation that would have\\n\\nresulted in a reasonable person committing such a deadly act, we\\n\\nconclude that the trial court properly found that “[t]he argument\\n\\nbetween [Henderson] and his teenage sister over the use of the\\n\\nbathroom . . . was insufficient to generate in a reasonable person a\\n\\nsudden and irresistible passion to kill.”\\n\\n     3. Finally, Henderson contends that the trial court’s\\n\\ncumulative errors were not harmless and require reversal. To\\n\\ndemonstrate cumulative prejudice that warrants a new trial,\\n\\nHenderson must show that “at least two errors were committed in\\n\\n                                  18\\n the course of the trial; [and] considered together along with the\\n\\nentire record, the multiple errors so infected the jury’s deliberation\\n\\nthat they denied [Henderson] a fundamentally fair trial.” (Citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted.) State v. Lane, \\n308 Ga. 10\\n, 21 (4) (\\n838\\n\\nSE2d 808\\n) (2020). Because Henderson has not carried his burden of\\n\\nshowing that at least two errors were committed during the trial,\\n\\nthis claim must fail. See \\nid.\\n We note that, because Henderson has\\n\\nfailed to demonstrate any trial court error, we need not decide what\\n\\ntype of error has been alleged, whether prejudice or harm has been\\n\\nshown under the standard applicable to that type of error, or how\\n\\nthose standards may interact under a cumulative error review\\n\\ninvolving different types of errors.

GRIFFIN v. THE EMORY CLINIC INC. et al.\\n\\n      GOBEIL, Judge.\\n\\n      Joseph Griffin filed suit against The Emory Clinic, Inc. (“Emory”), David R.\\n\\nPropp, M.D., and his medical assistant, Anna Smith (collectively, the “Defendants”),\\n\\nalleging negligence based on injuries he suffered from a fall during a medical visit. The\\n\\ntrial court granted the Defendants’ motion to dismiss, on the basis that Griffin failed\\n\\nto file an expert affidavit in compliance with OCGA § 9-11-9.1 (a), even though his\\n\\ncomplaint alleged professional malpractice. Griffin now appeals, arguing in\\n\\ninterrelated enumerations of error that the trial court erred in granting the motion to\\n\\ndismiss because Smith is not a licensed medical professional for whom an expert\\n affidavit under OCGA § 9-11-9.1 (a) is required. For the reasons that follow, we affirm\\n\\nin part and reverse in part.\\n\\n             A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief\\n      may be granted should not be sustained unless (1) the allegations of the\\n      complaint disclose with certainty that the claimant would not be entitled\\n      to relief under any state of provable facts asserted in support thereof; and\\n      (2) the movant establishes that the claimant could not possibly introduce\\n      evidence within the framework of the complaint sufficient to warrant a\\n      grant of the relief sought. If, within the framework of the complaint,\\n      evidence may be introduced which will sustain a grant of the relief sought\\n      by the claimant, the complaint is sufficient and a motion to dismiss\\n      should be denied.

On\\n      appeal, a trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\\n      claim for which relief may be granted is reviewed de novo.\\n\\n\\nEastside Recovery, LLC v. Calhoun, \\n368 Ga. App. 385\\n, 386 (\\n890 SE2d 135\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      So viewed, the record shows that since 2005, Griffin has been wheelchair-bound\\n\\nand is non-weight-bearing at the baseline. On September 3, 2020, Griffin visited\\n\\nEmory for a regular medical examination with Dr. Propp, his long-term physician.\\n\\nBefore being seen by Dr. Propp, Griffin was taken by Smith, Dr. Propp’s medical\\n\\n                                           2\\n assistant, to get weighed. Griffin was instructed by Smith to get out of his wheelchair\\n\\nwithout assistance and to climb onto a weighing machine. While trying to get onto the\\n\\nmachine, Griffin fell and suffered injuries, including a femur fracture in his right leg.\\n\\n      On August 22, 2022, Griffin filed the instant complaint, alleging that the\\n\\nDefendants were negligent in causing his injuries because they “knew or ought to have\\n\\nknown that [Griffin,] based on his medical condition and age[,] should have been\\n\\nweighed with a machine that fits his condition and[/]or aided while climbing and\\n\\nstanding on a weighing machine for his weight to be taken.” Griffin did not attach an\\n\\nexpert affidavit, pursuant to OCGA § 9-11-9.1 (a), to his complaint. The Defendants\\n\\nfiled an answer, and also moved to dismiss the complaint due to Griffin’s failure to file\\n\\nan expert affidavit in support of his professional malpractice claim.\\n\\n      At oral argument, Griffin, through counsel, admitted that his fall was not the\\n\\nresult of tripping or slipping. Rather, he alleged that he fell “because based on [his]\\n\\ncondition, he shouldn’t have been told to rise from his wheelchair when [the\\n\\nDefendants knew] that he can’t do that.” The trial court granted the motion to\\n\\ndismiss, concluding that Griffin was required to file an expert affidavit as his claim\\n\\nsounded in professional negligence based on his contention that “because [the]\\n\\n\\n                                            3\\n Defendants knew of his medical condition and medical limitations, they should not\\n\\nhave instructed him to stand unassisted.” The instant appeal followed.\\n\\n      Griffin argues that the trial court erred in granting the Defendants’ motion to\\n\\ndismiss for failure to include an expert affidavit because Smith, the medical assistant\\n\\nwhose alleged negligence caused his injuries, is not a licensed professional for whom\\n\\nan expert affidavit under OCGA § 9-11-9.1 is required. In a related claim of error, he\\n\\nasserts that the trial court failed to consider Smith’s classification as a non-licensed\\n\\nmedical professional before dismissing the complaint. At this stage of the proceeding,\\n\\nwe agree.\\n\\n      As an initial matter, the Defendants highlight in their appellate brief that Griffin\\n\\nfailed to raise his argument about Smith’s status as a non-licensed medical\\n\\nprofessional in the trial court.\\n\\n      Nevertheless, OCGA § 9-11-9.1 imposes an initial pleading requirement\\n      on the plaintiff in a malpractice action, and in reviewing the grant of a\\n      motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, it is the duty of the\\n      appellate court to construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to\\n      the appellant with all doubts resolved in appellant’s favor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           4\\n Procter v.

Rather, he generally alleged that the “Defendants knew or ought to\\n\\nhave known that [Griffin,] based on his medical condition and age[,] should have been\\n\\nweighed with a machine that fits his condition and[/]or aided while climbing and\\n\\nstanding on a weighing machine for his weight to be taken.” The Defendants highlight\\n\\nthat Griffin’s complaint against the Defendants “in its entirety sounds in professional\\n\\nnegligence,” and therefore, he was required to file an expert affidavit.\\n\\n       However, in his complaint, Griffin asserted that Smith, a medical assistant,\\n\\nperformed negligent acts — namely, requiring Griffin to climb onto the weighing scale\\n\\nunassisted despite his known physical limitations — which resulted in his fall and\\n\\nsubsequent injuries. OCGA § 9-11-9.1 (a) requires the contemporaneous filing of an\\n\\nexpert affidavit only in professional malpractice claims asserted against certain\\n\\nprofessionals, and “medical assistant” does not fall into any of the categories of\\n\\nprofessionals enumerated within the Code section.1 See Pattman v. Mann, \\n307 Ga.\\n\\n1\\n\\n         See OCGA § 9-11-9.1 (g) (listing architects, attorneys at law, audiologists,\\ncertified public accountants, chiropractors, clinical social workers, dentists, dietitians,\\nland surveyors, marriage and family therapists, medical doctors, nurses, occupational\\ntherapists, optometrists, osteopathic physicians, pharmacists, physical therapists,\\nphysicians’ assistants, podiatrists, professional counselors, professional engineers,\\npsychologists, radiological technicians, respiratory therapists, speech-language\\n                                            6\\nApp. 413\\n, 417 n.13 (\\n701 SE2d 232\\n) (2010) (noting that the “affidavit requirement does\\n\\nnot apply to any acts committed by [the lab technologist], who is not recognized as a\\n\\n‘professional’ under Georgia law”); Sembler Atlanta Dev. I, LLC v. URS/Dames &\\n\\nMoore, Inc., \\n268 Ga. App. 7\\n, 9 (\\n601 SE2d 397\\n) (2004) (explaining that, by its specific\\n\\nterms, OCGA § 9-11-9.1 (a) limits the expert affidavit requirement to professional\\n\\nmalpractice suits against members of one of the enumerated professions or the\\n\\nemployer of same when the employer’s liability is predicated on the professional\\n\\nnegligence of such employee).\\n\\n      Thus, construing the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to\\n\\nGriffin, as we must on a motion to dismiss, his complaint could be read to state a claim\\n\\nfor ordinary negligence against Smith, a medical assistant. And medical assistant does\\n\\nnot fall within any of the categories of professionals enumerated in OCGA § 9-11-9.1\\n\\n(g). Consequently, he was not required to file an expert affidavit in order to state a\\n\\nclaim against Smith. See Procter, \\n312 Ga.

However, in his complaint, Griffin alleged\\n\\nthat Smith is Dr. Propp’s medical assistant and was acting under Dr. Propp’s\\n\\n“negligent instruction.”2 Importantly, “[a] complaint is not required to set forth a\\n\\ncause of action, but need only set forth a claim for relief.

JAMES LAMAR WRIGHT, JR. v. THE STATE.\\n\\n         In 2018, James Lamar Wright, Jr. pleaded guilty to armed robbery and other\\noffenses in three related cases, and the trial court imposed a total sentence of ten years\\nin prison, to be followed by ten years on probation. In 2024, Wright filed a motion\\ncorrect a void sentence and a “Motion to Vacate Mere Nullity Void Judgment and\\nSentence and to Expunge Such OCGA §§ 17-9-4 and 9-14-48 (d)” in these cases. The\\ntrial court entered an order denying and dismissing Wright’s motions on February 7,\\n2024. On March 13, 2024, Wright filed, in the Supreme Court of Georgia, a document\\nentitled “Mere Nullity Void Judgment and Sentence Accordingly to OCGA\\n§§ 9-14-48 (d) & 17-9-4.” The Supreme Court docketed the filing as an application\\nfor discretionary review of the February 7 order and transferred the case to us for want\\nof jurisdiction. For the reasons set forth below, we also lack jurisdiction.\\n         First, to the extent that Wright seeks appellate review of the February 7 order\\nvia an application for discretionary review, the application is untimely. An application\\nfor discretionary appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of the judgment or trial\\ncourt order sought to be appealed. OCGA § 5-6-35 (d). “The requirements of OCGA\\n§ 5-6-35 are jurisdictional and this [C]ourt cannot accept an appeal not made in\\ncompliance therewith.” Boyle v. State, \\n190 Ga. App. 734\\n, 734 (\\n380 SE2d 57\\n) (1989).\\nWright’s filing was submitted 35 days after the trial court order was entered, and is\\nuntimely as a result, regardless of whether an appeal otherwise would lie from that\\norder.\\n         Second, to the extent Wright is requesting us to act by invoking our original\\njurisdiction, see generally Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. VI, Sec. I, Par. IV, any such\\n request is not properly before this Court. “Generally, the superior courts of this state\\nhave the power, in proper cases, to issue process in the nature of mandamus,\\nprohibition, specific performance, quo warranto, and injunction, and hence the need\\nto resort to the appellate courts for such relief by petition filed in the appellate courts\\nwill be extremely rare.” Brown v. Johnson, \\n251 Ga. 436\\n, 436 (\\n306 SE2d 655\\n) (1983). As\\nsuch, the procedure to be followed before seeking to invoke this Court’s original\\njurisdiction is to file the petition in the appropriate lower court first. See Graham v.\\nCavender, \\n252 Ga. 123\\n, 123 (\\n311 SE2d 832\\n) (1984); Expedia, Inc. v. City of Columbus,\\n305 Ga. App. 450\\n, 455 (2) (b) (\\n699 SE2d 600\\n) (2010) (“Except in the rarest of cases,\\nlitigants seeking to invoke this Court’s original jurisdiction . . . must first petition the\\nsuperior court for such relief.”). Here, the limited application materials submitted by\\nWright — who remains incarcerated — contain no indication that he has sought and\\nobtained a ruling on a request for relief in the nature of mandamus, prohibition,\\nspecific performance, quo warranto, or injunction in the superior court. Regardless,\\nOCGA § 9-10-14 (b) prohibits any clerk of court from accepting for filing “any action\\nby an inmate of a state or local penal or correctional institution against the state[,] . .\\n. unless the complaint or other initial pleading is on a form or forms promulgated by\\nthe Administrative Office of the Courts.” Wright’s filing is not on a form promulgated\\nby the Administrative Office of the Courts, and we therefore lack the authority to\\naccept it as a petition seeking to invoke this Court’s original jurisdiction.\\n       For each of the foregoing reasons, we lack jurisdiction to consider this\\napplication, which is hereby DISMISSED.\\n\\n                                          Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\n                                            Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\\n                                                                        05/16/2024\\n                                                     I certify that the above is a true extract from\\n                                          the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\n                                                    Witness my signature and the seal of said court\\n                                          hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                            , Clerk.\\n ', metadata={'source': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/9502799/james-lamar-wright-jr-v-state/'}),\n",

JENNINGS v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n      LAGRUA, Justice.\\n\\n      Appellant Savanna Jennings was convicted of malice murder\\n\\nand related charges in connection with the shooting death of her\\n\\ngrandfather, Otha Perrin, Sr.1 On appeal, Jennings contends that:\\n\\n\\n      1 The crimes occurred on January      3, 2018. On January 22, 2018, an\\nElbert County grand jury indicted Jennings, William Peterson, and Dakota\\nStreet for malice murder (Count 1), possession of a firearm during the\\ncommission of a felony (Count 2), felony murder (Count 3), two counts of\\naggravated assault (Counts 4 and 5), possession of a firearm during the\\ncommission of a felony (Count 6), and concealing the death of another (Count\\n7). Peterson was also indicted for an additional count of felony murder (Count\\n8) and for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon (Count 9).\\n      Peterson and Street pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified as\\nwitnesses for the State. Jennings was tried in August 2019, and the jury found\\nher guilty of all counts. She was sentenced to serve life in prison without the\\npossibility of parole for malice murder (Count 1), five years in prison\\nconsecutive for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony\\n(Count 2), and ten years in prison consecutive for concealing the death of\\nanother (Count 7). Counts 3, 4, 5, and 6 were merged or vacated by operation\\nof law. In total, Jennings received a sentence of life in prison without the\\npossibility of parole plus 15 years in confinement. Jennings filed a timely\\n (1) the trial court abused its discretion by admitting other-acts\\n\\nevidence; (2) the trial court abused its discretion by admitting\\n\\ncertain business records; and (3) her trial counsel provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance. For the reasons that follow,\\n\\nthese claims fail, and we affirm Jennings’s convictions.\\n\\n      The evidence presented at trial showed that William Peterson\\n\\nshot Perrin, and Jennings was a party to the crime because she\\n\\nintentionally aided or abetted Peterson in the shooting or she\\n\\nintentionally advised, encouraged, hired, counseled, or procured\\n\\nPeterson to commit the crime. See OCGA § 16-2-20 (b) (3) and (4).\\n\\n      Jennings and her brother lived in Elberton intermittently with\\n\\ntheir grandparents since they were young children. In 2015, their\\n\\ngrandmother passed away, and Jennings and her newborn son\\n\\nmoved back in with Perrin the next year. During that same year,\\n\\nshe asked Justin Cain, the father of her son, “Would you tell me how\\n\\n\\n\\nmotion for new trial, which was amended through new counsel. After holding\\nan evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion for new trial on June\\n12, 2023. Jennings filed a timely notice of appeal, and her case was docketed\\nto this Court’s term beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision\\non the briefs.\\n\\n                                      2\\n to get away with killing someone?” and “Would you tell me how to\\n\\nget away with killing my granddad?” Cain laughed it off, and they\\n\\ndid not speak about it again.\\n\\n     Also in 2016, Jennings began dating William Peterson. In\\n\\nMarch 2017, Peterson was arrested for and eventually convicted of\\n\\nfalse imprisonment regarding an incident with Jennings. After this\\n\\nincident, Jennings and Peterson did not have any contact with each\\n\\nother for approximately six months. In September 2017, Jennings\\n\\nand Peterson reconnected, and Jennings told Peterson that\\n\\nJennings’s great-uncle had molested her as a child and Perrin “made\\n\\nJennings forgive” her granduncle. Peterson testified that he and\\n\\nJennings “talked about . . . killing [Perrin].” But Jennings testified\\n\\nthat she only “discussed wanting [Perrin] dead.” At some point after\\n\\nthis conversation, Jennings moved to East Point, Georgia, but in\\n\\nDecember 2017, she moved back in with Perrin. Dakota Street, a\\n\\nfriend of Jennings’s brother, also moved in with Perrin and Jennings\\n\\naround this time.\\n\\n     On December 25, 2017, Jennings and Peterson reconnected\\n\\n\\n                                  3\\n again at a Christmas gathering. Peterson testified that Jennings\\n\\ntold him something that “bothered [him]” and he “thought about it\\n\\nfor the next week or so.” Jennings testified that the “something” she\\n\\ntold Peterson was that Perrin “had pulled a gun out on me and my\\n\\nson while we was in the bed because he thought we was somebody\\n\\nelse in the house there to rob him, and -- Oh, and that he was\\n\\ntouching on me.” Jennings also testified that she told Peterson she\\n\\nwanted Perrin dead.\\n\\n     Nine days later, on January 3, 2018—the night of the murder—\\n\\nJennings picked up Peterson and drove him to Perrin’s house.\\n\\nSeveral witnesses gave differing accounts of what was discussed\\n\\nthat evening. Peterson testified that he told Jennings and Street\\n\\nthat he was going to kill Perrin, but “they thought he [said it in] a\\n\\njoking way.” In contrast, Street testified that Jennings told him that\\n\\nshe and Peterson “were [going to try] to strangle [Perrin] in his sleep\\n\\n. . . put a pillow case over him or a pillow over him to make it seem\\n\\nlike he died in his sleep.” During Jennings’s testimony, she said\\n\\nPeterson made a comment early in the evening that “if [he were] to\\n\\n\\n                                  4\\n kill someone, [a relative’s pond] is where [he] would put them,” but\\n\\nshe denied asking Peterson to kill Perrin or that they talked about\\n\\nkilling Perrin.\\n\\n     Still   another   account   came   from   Jennings’s   cellmate,\\n\\nSamantha White, who claimed Jennings told her “pretty much\\n\\neverything” about the murder. White testified that Jennings told her\\n\\nthat Jennings “hyped [Peterson] up about [Jennings] being molested\\n\\nas a child” and Peterson was “angry about somebody[] molesting\\n\\n[Jennings] when she was younger and touching her in inappropriate\\n\\nways.” Jennings also told White that “they had joked about it before,\\n\\nabout killing [Perrin], but up until that night . . . she didn’t think\\n\\nthat they meant it.”\\n\\n     Street testified that on the night of Perrin’s murder he “texted\\n\\n[Jennings] to see what was going on.” Specifically, Street sent\\n\\nJennings a message via Facebook that asked whether Peterson was\\n\\n“still doing it,” which Street explained meant whether “they were\\n\\ngoing to strangle or smother [Perrin] in his sleep.” Jennings\\n\\nresponded, “No texting.”\\n\\n\\n                                  5\\n      That evening, Peterson obtained Perrin’s gun from Perrin’s\\n\\nbedroom. Jennings said she was asleep when this happened but she\\n\\nremembered waking up at some point, seeing Peterson “playing with\\n\\n[Perrin’s] gun,” “cuss[ing] him out,” and falling back asleep. Street,\\n\\nhowever, testified that when Peterson was checking the gun to make\\n\\nsure it was loaded, they were in Jennings’s bedroom, and she was\\n\\npresent and “on her phone.”\\n\\n      Peterson went into Perrin’s bedroom and shot him “until the\\n\\ngun was empty.” Jennings testified that she was awoken by the\\n\\nsound of four or five gunshots, but she said that when Peterson came\\n\\ninto her room and told her that he shot Perrin, she thought he was\\n\\njoking and she went back to sleep. Peterson, likewise, testified that\\n\\nJennings had “no clue” he was going to shoot Perrin.\\n\\n     After the shooting, Peterson took the gun apart and burned the\\n\\nstock of the gun in a barrel in Perrin’s backyard before wrapping\\n\\nPerrin’s body in his mattress cover. Jennings testified that she woke\\n\\nup and saw Peterson wrapping Perrin’s body, at which point she\\n\\nrealized the murder had occurred. Jennings testified that she did\\n\\n\\n                                  6\\n not call 911 because Peterson threatened her. Instead, she drove\\n\\nPeterson to his relative’s property on Wahatchee Creek Road, where\\n\\nhe hid the rest of the gun underneath a house on the property.\\n\\nJennings then drove Peterson to work. A short time later, Peterson\\n\\ncalled Jennings and asked to be picked up. Jennings picked up\\n\\nPeterson from work and brought him back to Perrin’s house, where\\n\\nthey both spent the night.\\n\\n     The next day, Peterson dragged Perrin’s body outside and\\n\\nplaced it in the trunk of Perrin’s car. Peterson and Street drove to\\n\\nthe property on Wahatchee Creek Road, and Peterson dumped\\n\\nPerrin’s body into a pond on the property. Peterson then told\\n\\nJennings and Street “to come up with a plan.” Jennings decided to\\n\\nfabricate a story that Perrin left the house for a car transmission\\n\\nand did not come back. Peterson spent the night at Perrin’s house,\\n\\nand Jennings drove him home the next day. Several days later,\\n\\nPeterson told a cousin, “Me and [Jennings] killed her grandpa.”\\n\\n     Approximately four days after Perrin’s murder, on January 7,\\n\\nJennings and Street went to the Elbert County Sheriff’s Office (the\\n\\n\\n                                 7\\n “ECSO”) and reported Perrin missing, stating that he went “to get a\\n\\ntransmission, and he never came back.” A deputy told them to\\n\\nreturn the next morning if Perrin did not come home that night.\\n\\n     The next morning, Jennings and Street went to the ECSO and\\n\\ngave written statements, stating that Perrin left home on January\\n\\n4 to look for a transmission and had not come back. But later that\\n\\nsame day, both Jennings and Street admitted that Peterson shot\\n\\nPerrin on the evening of January 3.\\n\\n     Street offered to show police where Perrin’s body was located,\\n\\nand he directed police to the property on Wahatchee Creek Road,\\n\\nwhere Perrin’s body was retrieved from a pond. After Perrin’s body\\n\\nwas recovered, Lieutenant Adam Moss obtained a search warrant\\n\\nand searched Perrin’s house, where a .22-caliber projectile was\\n\\nrecovered from underneath Perrin’s bed.\\n\\n     Later that day, Peterson was arrested for Perrin’s murder.\\n\\nPeterson initially told police that Jennings or Street killed Perrin,\\n\\nbut he later admitted that he killed Perrin and said that Jennings\\n\\noffered him a red truck in exchange for killing Perrin.\\n\\n\\n                                  8\\n      The next day, Jennings was arrested. After she was advised of\\n\\nher Miranda2 rights, she directed police to the abandoned house on\\n\\nWahatchee Creek Road where Peterson hid Perrin’s gun. From\\n\\nunderneath the side of the house, police recovered a .22-caliber rifle,\\n\\nmissing its wooden stock. While on the property, Jennings stated\\n\\nthat Peterson hid the gun the night Perrin was killed, but Peterson\\n\\ndid not dispose of Perrin’s body on the property until the next day.\\n\\n     Lieutenant Moss recovered a cell phone belonging to Jennings\\n\\nfrom Perrin’s car. Jennings’s phone did not contain a contact for\\n\\nPeterson, and the phone’s messages and call log contained no\\n\\nmention of Peterson.\\n\\n     While Jennings was in jail awaiting trial, she befriended Carlie\\n\\nMinervino, another inmate. Minervino testified that Jennings said\\n\\nshe was in jail because “she had her granddaddy killed.” 3 Because\\n\\nMinervino was going to be released soon, Jennings asked Minervino\\n\\nto buy a phone once she was released, download an app, and create\\n\\n\\n\\n     2 Miranda v. Arizona, \\n384 U.S. 436\\n (86 SCt 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966).\\n     3 Jennings denied she told Minervino that she planned to kill Perrin.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     9\\n fake text messages between Jennings and Peterson. Jennings wrote\\n\\nthe messages to be created on a piece of paper and gave them to\\n\\nMinervino, who stored the paper in a Bible. Minervino, however, left\\n\\nthe Bible (and the fabricated messages) behind when she was\\n\\nreleased from jail. After Minervino was released, Jennings\\n\\nrepeatedly called her from jail to ask if she had created the\\n\\nfabricated messages. Jennings’s jail phone calls were monitored by\\n\\nLieutenant Moss, who got a search warrant for the Bible and found\\n\\nthe messages. The messages generally portrayed two conversations\\n\\nbetween Jennings and Peterson, one on the evening of the murder\\n\\nand one a few days later, in which Peterson took responsibility for\\n\\nkilling Perrin and Jennings expressed shock and anger that he had\\n\\ndone so.\\n\\n     At trial, White, Jennings’s cellmate, testified that Jennings\\n\\nwould “go back and forth” on why she wanted Perrin dead, offering\\n\\nreasons that included Perrin “had touched” Jennings when she was\\n\\nyounger, Perrin “was strict on her,” and she needed money and was\\n\\neither a beneficiary of Perrin’s life insurance policy or she would\\n\\n\\n                                10\\n obtain half of everything Perrin owned. Jennings testified she\\n\\n“didn’t know [she] was a beneficiary [of Perrin’s life insurance\\n\\npolicy]” prior to Perrin’s death, claiming she learned that she was a\\n\\nbeneficiary in the discovery provided by the State. Jennings also\\n\\ntestified that she would often write checks for Perrin, with his\\n\\nconsent, “[l]ike if he was driving or something, he would tell [her] to\\n\\nwrite to the check for him.” She further testified that sometimes\\n\\nPerrin would gift her money and have her write the check to herself.4\\n\\n     1. Jennings contends that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nunder OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (“Rule 404 (b)”) in admitting other-acts\\n\\nevidence in the form of Perrin’s bank records, implying that\\n\\nJennings stole from Perrin. We conclude, however, that this\\n\\nevidence was intrinsic, and we see no abuse of discretion in its\\n\\nadmission. See Heade v. State, \\n312 Ga. 19\\n, 24 (3) (\\n860 SE2d 509\\n)\\n\\n(2021) (“Because the evidence was intrinsic, it was outside the reach\\n\\nof Rule 404 (b).” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n\\n     4 The State introduced Perrin’s bank records, evidencing that 14 checks\\n\\nwere made out to Jennings from Perrin’s checking account in an amount\\ntotaling over $7,000.\\n\\n                                    11\\n      “‘Intrinsic evidence’ is defined as evidence that (1) pertains to\\n\\nan uncharged offense arising from the same transaction or series of\\n\\ntransactions as the charged offense; (2) is necessary to complete the\\n\\nstory of the crime; or (3) is inextricably intertwined with the\\n\\nevidence regarding the charged offense.” Abbott v. State, \\n311 Ga.\\n\\n478\\n, 482 (2) (\\n858 SE2d 696\\n) (2021) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     [E]vidence pertaining to the chain of events explaining\\n     the context, motive, and set-up of the crime is properly\\n     admitted if it is linked in time and circumstances with the\\n     charged crime, or forms an integral and natural part of an\\n     account of the crime, or is necessary to complete the story\\n     of the crime for the jury[.] . . . And this sort of intrinsic\\n     evidence remains admissible even if it incidentally places\\n     the defendant’s character at issue.\\n\\nHeade, 312 Ga. at 25 (3) (citation and punctuation omitted;\\n\\nemphasis supplied). “In assessing whether evidence is necessary in\\n\\nthis context, we have noted that ‘necessary’ is not used in a strictly\\n\\nliteral sense, but rather, refers to what evidence is reasonably\\n\\nnecessary for the State to complete the story of the crime.” Abbott,\\n\\n311 Ga. at 483 (2) (citation and some punctuation omitted).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  12\\n Additionally, “there is no bright-line rule regarding how close in\\n\\ntime evidence must be to the charged offenses . . . for that evidence\\n\\nto be admitted properly as intrinsic evidence.” Harris v. State, \\n310\\n\\nGa. 372\\n, 381 (2) (b) (\\n850 SE2d 77\\n) (2020).\\n\\n     In this case, the evidence showed that Perrin’s checking-\\n\\naccount balance dwindled from an average monthly balance of\\n\\napproximately $20,000 in March 21 through July 17, 2017, to $88.05\\n\\nin late December 2017, through a combination of cash withdrawals\\n\\nand drawn checks. From July through October, 14 checks were made\\n\\nout to Jennings from Perrin’s checking account in an amount\\n\\ntotaling over $7,000. 5 Jennings testified that Perrin gifted her\\n\\nmoney and allowed Jennings to write checks out of Perrin’s checking\\n\\naccount to herself. The State, however, argued that Jennings stole\\n\\nthe money from Perrin without his knowledge or consent.\\n\\n     Jennings argues that the bank records did not advance the\\n\\n“proffered motive” that Jennings had Perrin killed because she was\\n\\n\\n     5 There were also multiple checks made out to another person; the State\\n\\nacknowledged in closing argument that “Jennings wasn’t the only person who\\nwas taking advantage of Otha Perrin.”\\n\\n                                    13\\n the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. But Jennings fails to\\n\\nacknowledge that the State argued Jennings’s “financial motive\\n\\n[was] Otha Perrin’s empty bank account[] and the insurance policy.”\\n\\nDuring closing argument, the State argued that the bank records\\n\\nshowed that Jennings relied on Perrin financially (whether Perrin\\n\\nwas gifting Jennings money or Jennings was stealing from him) 6 and\\n\\nthat Perrin “had almost no money left in his bank account” prior to\\n\\nhis murder. The State then referenced Jennings’s testimony that she\\n\\nwas the beneficiary of Perrin’s life insurance policy and argued the\\n\\ndual financial motives of the “empty bank account[] and the\\n\\ninsurance policy.” White testified that Jennings “would go back and\\n\\nforth” on why she wanted Perrin dead, but she “talked about the\\n\\nmoney, the life insurance policies, that everything would be hers and\\n\\nher brother’s.” The jury would have been authorized to infer that\\n\\nonce Perrin’s checking account was depleted in December 2017,\\n\\nJennings convinced Peterson to kill Perrin in early January 2018 so\\n\\n\\n\\n     6 The State argued both that Jennings “was taking advantage of” Perrin\\n\\nand that he was “generous” and “helped her out.”\\n\\n                                    14\\n that she could obtain the proceeds of Perrin’s insurance policy and\\n\\nalso his personal and real property. In fact, Jennings admitted that\\n\\nshe started driving Perrin’s Cadillac, as opposed to her own car,\\n\\nafter he was killed. Thus, Perrin’s bank records were admissible as\\n\\nintrinsic evidence because the records were necessary to complete\\n\\nthe story of the crimes and helped explain Jennings’s financial\\n\\nmotive. See Abbott, 311 Ga. at 483 (2) (concluding that the trial court\\n\\ndid not abuse its discretion in classifying evidence that the\\n\\ndefendant stole from the victim in the weeks leading up to her\\n\\nmurder as intrinsic because it “formed part of the chronology of [the\\n\\ndefendant’s] crimes leading to the murders, offering insight into his\\n\\nmotive”). See also McKelvey v. State, \\n311 Ga. 34\\n, 40 (3) (\\n855 SE2d\\n\\n598\\n) (2021) (evidence of prior crime was properly admitted as\\n\\nintrinsic evidence where it pertained to chain of events leading to\\n\\ncharged crimes and helped explain the defendant’s motive).\\n\\n     Jennings also contends that any probative value of the bank\\n\\nrecords was substantially outweighed by their prejudice and thus\\n\\nthe records should have been excluded under OCGA § 24-4-403\\n\\n\\n                                  15\\n (“Rule 403”). See State v. Harris, \\n316 Ga. 272\\n, 278 (3) (\\n888 SE2d 50\\n)\\n\\n(2023) (“Intrinsic evidence must also satisfy Rule 403.” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)). Under Rule 403,\\n\\n     [r]elevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value\\n     is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\\n     prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\\n     or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or\\n     needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\\n\\n     Id. at 278 (3). “[A]ll inculpatory evidence is inherently\\n\\nprejudicial; it is only when unfair prejudice substantially outweighs\\n\\nprobative value that the rule permits exclusion.” Middlebrooks v.\\n\\nState, \\n310 Ga. 748\\n, 751 (\\n854 SE2d 503\\n) (2021) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted; emphasis in original).\\n\\n     Here, the bank records were not unfairly prejudicial. The\\n\\nrecords themselves did not show that Jennings was stealing from\\n\\nPerrin. But see Carter v. State, \\n317 Ga. 689\\n, 694 (2) (\\n895 SE2d 295\\n)\\n\\n(2023) (“The prejudicial effect of evidence is unfair if it has the\\n\\ncapacity to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground\\n\\ndifferent from proof specific to the offense charged, or an undue\\n\\ntendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly,\\n\\n\\n                                 16\\n though not necessarily, an emotional one.” (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)). In light of the high probative value of the bank records,\\n\\nevidencing Jennings’s financial motive, we conclude that the\\n\\nprobative value of Perrin’s bank records was not substantially\\n\\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Abbott, 311 Ga. at\\n\\n483 (2) (where the defendant’s stealing from the victim “formed part\\n\\nof the chronology of [the defendant’s] crimes leading to the murders,\\n\\noffering insight into his motive,” probative value of that evidence\\n\\nwas not substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice).\\n\\nAccordingly, this claim fails.\\n\\n     2. Jennings contends that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nby admitting certain Facebook messages between Jennings and\\n\\nStreet. Jennings argues the messages should have been excluded\\n\\nbecause they did not fall within the statutory hearsay exception for\\n\\nbusiness records under OCGA § 24-8-803 (6) and because Facebook’s\\n\\ndeclaration did not meet the standard for self-authenticating\\n\\nbusiness records under OCGA § 24-9-902 (11). The messages at issue\\n\\nshowed Street sending Jennings a message on the night of the\\n\\n\\n                                 17\\n murder that said, “He still doing it,” and Jennings immediately\\n\\nresponding, “No texting.” Street explained in his testimony that his\\n\\nmessage “He still doing it” was intended to ask Jennings whether\\n\\nPeterson was still planning to kill Perrin that night, as they had\\n\\npreviously discussed.\\n\\n     Jennings failed to object on these grounds at trial, so we review\\n\\nthe admission of these records for plain error only. 7 See Stafford v.\\n\\nState, \\n312 Ga. 811\\n, 820 (3) (b) (\\n865 SE2d 116\\n) (2021) (“Because [the\\n\\ndefendant] did not make a specific objection at trial to the admission\\n\\nof the statements on the grounds now asserted in his appeal, we\\n\\nreview these claims only for plain error.” (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)).\\n\\n     “To show plain error, an appellant must show that (1) the\\n\\nalleged error was not affirmatively waived, (2) it was obvious beyond\\n\\nreasonable dispute, and (3) it affected the appellant’s substantial\\n\\n\\n     7 Prior to trial, Jennings objected to the presentation of the Facebook\\n\\nrecords only on the basis that presenting the business records without a\\nwitness violated her substantive due process rights under the United States\\nand Georgia Constitutions. She made no objection concerning OCGA §§ 24-8-\\n803 (6) or 24-9-902.\\n\\n                                    18\\n rights, which ordinarily means showing that it affected the outcome\\n\\nof the trial.” Jackson v. State, \\n317 Ga. 95\\n, 106 (\\n891 SE2d 866\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). “This Court does not have to\\n\\nanalyze all elements of the plain-error test where an appellant fails\\n\\nto establish one of them.” Rutland v. State, \\n315 Ga. 521\\n, 524 (\\n883\\n\\nSE2d 730\\n) (2023). Pretermitting whether the trial court erred in\\n\\nadmitting the Facebook records, we conclude that Jennings has\\n\\nfailed to satisfy the third prong of the plain-error analysis, requiring\\n\\nher “to make an affirmative showing that the error probably did\\n\\naffect the outcome below.” Ruthenberg v. State, \\n317 Ga. 227\\n, 231 (2)\\n\\n(\\n892 SE2d 728\\n) (2023).\\n\\n     The other evidence introduced at trial included Jennings\\n\\ntestifying that she had twice “discussed wanting [Perrin] dead” to\\n\\nPeterson. She further testified that Peterson told her that “if\\n\\nsomebody ever F’d with [her], then he would kill them” and that\\n\\nJennings told Peterson that Perrin “was touching on [her].” She also\\n\\nadmitted that when she told Peterson that she wanted Perrin to die,\\n\\nPeterson responded, “I got you.” A week later, she picked Peterson\\n\\n\\n                                  19\\n up from his home and brought him to Perrin’s house, and Peterson\\n\\nkilled Perrin that evening. Peterson testified that he did not know\\n\\nwhy he killed Perrin, but he admitted that he told police that\\n\\nJennings “offered” him a “red truck” to kill Perrin.\\n\\n     Jennings testified that, after Peterson killed Perrin, she drove\\n\\nPeterson to the abandoned house where he disposed of the gun and\\n\\nthen drove him to work. Approximately three days after Perrin was\\n\\nkilled, Peterson told his cousin, “Me and [Jennings] killed her\\n\\ngrandpa. We shot him, like, seven times.”\\n\\n     After Jennings was arrested, she shared a cell with White, who\\n\\ntestified that Jennings told her that Jennings “hyped [Peterson] up\\n\\nabout being molested as a child” before Peterson shot Perrin. White\\n\\nalso stated that Jennings explained that she, Peterson, and Street\\n\\nwrapped up Perrin’s body and dumped it in a pond. Additionally,\\n\\nJennings attempted to convince another inmate at the jail to\\n\\nmanufacture messages between Jennings and Peterson to make it\\n\\nappear as though she did not want Perrin dead.\\n\\n     Given the other strong evidence at trial, Jennings cannot show\\n\\n\\n                                 20\\n that the introduction of the Facebook messages (Exhibits 70 and 71)\\n\\nbetween her and Street likely affected the outcome of the trial court\\n\\nproceedings, particularly since Street testified about the content of\\n\\nthe messages. Thus, Jennings cannot satisfy the third prong of the\\n\\nplain-error test, and this claim fails. See Williams v. State, \\n316 Ga.\\n\\n304\\n, 314 (4) (\\n888 SE2d 60\\n) (2023) (any error in admitting hearsay\\n\\nwas harmless given the strength of the evidence identifying and\\n\\ninculpating the defendant and the cumulative nature of the hearsay\\n\\ntestimony).\\n\\n     3.    Jennings     contends    that    her    counsel      provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by (a) failing to preserve her\\n\\nobjection to Perrin’s bank records, (b) failing to preserve her\\n\\nobjection to the Facebook records, and (c) failing to (i) preserve an\\n\\nobjection to the exclusion of her domestic-violence expert and (ii)\\n\\nfailing to timely disclose her expert.\\n\\n     To prevail on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,\\n\\nJennings      must   demonstrate   both    that   her   trial   counsel’s\\n\\nperformance was professionally deficient and that she was\\n\\n\\n                                   21\\n prejudiced by this deficient performance. See Bates v. State, \\n313 Ga.\\n\\n57\\n, 62 (2) (\\n867 SE2d 140\\n) (2022) (citing Strickland v. Washington,\\n\\n466 U.S. 668\\n, 687 (III) (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984)). To\\n\\nestablish deficient performance, Jennings must show that trial\\n\\ncounsel performed her duties in an objectively unreasonable way,\\n\\nconsidering all the circumstances and in the light of prevailing\\n\\nprofessional norms. See \\nid.\\n Establishing deficient performance\\n\\n     is no easy showing, as the law recognizes a strong\\n     presumption that counsel performed reasonably, and [the\\n     appellant] bears the burden of overcoming this\\n     presumption. To carry this burden, he must show that no\\n     reasonable lawyer would have done what his lawyer did,\\n     or would have failed to do what his lawyer did not. In\\n     particular, decisions regarding trial tactics and strategy\\n     may form the basis for an ineffectiveness claim only if\\n     they were so patently unreasonable that no competent\\n     attorney would have followed such a course.\\n\\nPark v. State, \\n314 Ga. 733\\n, 740-741 (\\n879 SE2d 400\\n) (2022) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). To establish prejudice, Jennings must\\n\\nprove that there is a reasonable probability that, but for her trial\\n\\ncounsel’s deficiency, the result of the trial would have been different.\\n\\nSee Bates, 313 Ga. at 62 (2). “A reasonable probability is a\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  22\\n probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id.\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). “And, this burden is a heavy\\n\\none.” Id. at 62-63 (2) (citation and punctuation omitted). “If an\\n\\nappellant fails to meet his or her burden of proving either prong of\\n\\nthe Strickland test, the reviewing court does not have to examine\\n\\nthe other prong.” Taylor v. State, \\n315 Ga. 630\\n, 647 (5) (b) (\\n884 SE2d\\n\\n346\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     (a)   Jennings      contends        that   her   counsel   provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to preserve her\\n\\nobjection to the admission of Perrin’s bank records. But Jennings\\n\\nalso argues that “[t]rial counsel appears to have preserved objections\\n\\nto . . . [Perrin’s bank records] . . . so as to receive merits review.” We\\n\\nagree that counsel preserved her objection to the introduction of\\n\\nPerrin’s bank records by objecting at trial, and we have reviewed\\n\\nJennings’s enumeration of error pertaining to the admission of those\\n\\nrecords in Division 1 (a). Thus, we conclude that counsel was not\\n\\ndeficient, and this claim fails. See Salvesen v. State, \\n317 Ga. 314\\n,\\n\\n321 (4) (\\n893 SE2d 66\\n) (2023) (rejecting ineffective assistance claim\\n\\n\\n                                    23\\n based on purported failure to preserve errors where trial counsel\\n\\nproperly preserved his argument by making a timely objection\\n\\nbelow).\\n\\n     (b) Jennings contends that her trial counsel provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to preserve her\\n\\nobjection to the Facebook records between Jennings and Street.\\n\\nPretermitting whether counsel performed deficiently, 8 we conclude\\n\\nthat Jennings cannot show prejudice. “Again, to prove prejudice, [a\\n\\ndefendant] is required to show that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\\n\\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”\\n\\nIngram v. State, \\n316 Ga. 196\\n, 205 (1) (a) (\\n887 SE2d 269\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     “The prejudice step of the plain-error standard is equivalent to\\n\\nthe prejudice prong for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.”\\n\\nBozzie v. State, \\n302 Ga. 704\\n, 711 (4) (b) (\\n808 SE2d 671\\n) (2017). As\\n\\nexplained in Division 2, there was strong inculpatory evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n     8 As explained in Division 2, trial counsel preserved an objection to the\\n\\nFacebook records, but not on the grounds asserted on appeal.\\n\\n                                     24\\n admitted at trial and Street testified about the contents of the\\n\\nFacebook messages. Thus, Jennings cannot show a reasonable\\n\\nlikelihood that the result of her trial would have been different had\\n\\ncounsel preserved an objection to the Facebook records under OCGA\\n\\n§§ 24-8-803 (6) and 24-9-902 (11). Accordingly, this claim fails. See\\n\\nIngram, 316 Ga. at 205-206 (1) (a) (concluding that trial counsel’s\\n\\nfailure to object was harmless in light of the strong evidence of guilt).\\n\\n     (c)   Jennings     contends     that    her    counsel    provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by (i) failing to preserve her\\n\\nobjection to the exclusion of her domestic-violence expert and (ii)\\n\\nfailing to timely disclose her expert under OCGA § 17-16-4. We\\n\\nconclude that Jennings preserved her objection to the exclusion of\\n\\nher expert and that the claim for failing to timely disclose the expert\\n\\nfails because Jennings cannot establish prejudice.\\n\\n     At trial, Jennings called Lieutenant Derek Scott with the\\n\\nAthens-Clarke County Police Department to testify and asked\\n\\nwhether “as part of [his] training and experience,” he “learned about\\n\\nwhat’s known as the cycle of violence.” The State objected, and\\n\\n\\n                                   25\\n Lieutenant Scott was questioned outside the presence of the jury,\\n\\ntestifying that he had no firsthand knowledge of the details of the\\n\\ncase. The State then argued that Jennings was attempting to\\n\\npresent an expert without providing notice under OCGA § 17-16-4\\n\\nand that, if Lieutenant Scott was not an expert witness, his\\n\\ntestimony was inadmissible “because a lay witness cannot testify to\\n\\nan opinion unless it relates to facts of the case that they have\\n\\nfirsthand knowledge of.” The trial court ultimately excluded\\n\\nLieutenant Scott’s testimony, citing Virger v. State, \\n305 Ga. 281\\n (\\n824\\n\\nSE2d 346\\n) (2019), for the proposition that “this [C]ourt has\\n\\nconsistently upheld the exclusion of evidence of a defendant’s\\n\\ndiminished mental condition when offered to support other defenses\\n\\nor to negate the intent element of a crime.” Jennings’s trial counsel\\n\\nobjected to the trial court’s ruling, and the court permitted counsel\\n\\nto proffer Lieutenant Scott’s testimony on the record for the limited\\n\\npurpose of preserving the objection on appeal.\\n\\n     Regarding the delayed reporting of sexual abuse, Lieutenant\\n\\nScott’s proffered testimony was that:\\n\\n\\n                                 26\\n      With sex crimes, generally when it’s like kids involved,\\n     they don’t want to talk about it because, first of all, they\\n     don’t think that anybody’s going to believe them. It’s\\n     pretty hard to say that, you know, a father-type figure, a\\n     mother-type figure that everybody respects in the family\\n     is doing something that’s evil to somebody. So there’s a lot\\n     of fear with that, or they have made comments about it,\\n     and they’re just rejected. So then they just – They\\n     withhold it. There’s many reasons, but a lot of it is just\\n     about manipulation and control.\\n\\nHe also said that people sometimes delay reporting sexual abuse\\n\\n“because they fear that the loss of . . . financial resource[s] would\\n\\noccur.” Specifically for “a child that’s been raised by [a] grandparent\\n\\n. . . everything is supplied to them by their parent or grandparent,\\n\\nso depending on their ages, they don’t see that there’s an outlet.\\n\\nThey don’t see that there’s an opportunity to go anywhere else\\n\\nbecause that’s all they know.” After Lieutenant Scott testified, the\\n\\ntrial court reiterated that its ruling was based on Virger, and counsel\\n\\nmaintained her objection.\\n\\n     In its order denying the motion for new trial, the trial court\\n\\nfound that Jennings called Lieutenant Scott as an expert and that\\n\\nshe failed to provide the State with a summary of his opinion at least\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  27\\n five days prior to trial in accordance with OCGA § 17-16-4. The trial\\n\\ncourt concluded that Jennings failed to comply with OCGA § 17-16-\\n\\n4, a different basis entirely from its ruling at trial, and that\\n\\nLieutenant Scott’s testimony was properly excluded. The trial court\\n\\nalso concluded that trial counsel preserved any objection relating to\\n\\nthe exclusion of Lieutenant Scott’s testimony.9\\n\\n     (i) Jennings contends that her trial counsel performed\\n\\ndeficiently by failing to preserve her objection to the exclusion of\\n\\nLieutenant Scott’s testimony, but as shown above, Jennings\\n\\npreserved her objection. Thus, we conclude that counsel did not\\n\\nperform deficiently. See Salvesen, 317 Ga. at 321 (4).\\n\\n     (ii) Pretermitting whether Jennings’s trial counsel performed\\n\\ndeficiently by failing to comply with OCGA § 17-16-4 by providing\\n\\nnotice of her expert, we conclude that Jennings has failed to\\n\\nestablish prejudice. To establish prejudice, Jennings must show that\\n\\nthere is “a reasonable probability that the expert’s testimony would\\n\\n\\n     9 In its order, the trial court “[f]ound that . . . trial counsel did preserve\\n\\nall of the foregoing errors,” but did not make any specific findings regarding\\nthe exclusion of Lieutenant Scott’s testimony.\\n\\n                                       28\\n have made a difference [at] trial.” See Parker v. State, \\n305 Ga. 136\\n,\\n\\n141 (4) (a) (\\n823 SE2d 313\\n) (2019).\\n\\n     Jennings argues Lieutenant Scott’s testimony was admissible\\n\\nbecause it “would have been offered to explain why . . . Jennings\\n\\nmight have delayed [the] reporting [of] sexual abuse [by Perrin],\\n\\nwhich went to her credibility on the stand.” But even assuming that\\n\\nLieutenant Scott’s testimony was admissible on this point (and that\\n\\nthe jury believed that Jennings delayed reporting Perrin’s sexual\\n\\nabuse), Lieutenant Scott’s testimony would not have been helpful to\\n\\nJennings since it provided her with a strong motive to want Perrin\\n\\ndead, i.e., Perrin had molested her. This sexual-abuse motive,\\n\\nalthough not the motive advanced by the State, was weaved\\n\\nthroughout the evidence introduced at trial through Jennings’s\\n\\ntestimony that Perrin “was touching on her,” Peterson’s testimony\\n\\nthat Jennings told him that she had been molested, and White’s\\n\\ntestimony that Jennings said she “hyped [Peterson] up about\\n\\n[Jennings] being molested as a child,” impliedly to get Peterson to\\n\\nshoot Perrin. Because Lieutenant Scott’s testimony would have\\n\\n\\n                                 29\\n supported the theory that Jennings convinced Peterson to kill Perrin\\n\\nbecause he had molested her, Jennings cannot show that there is a\\n\\nreasonable probability that Lieutenant Scott’s testimony would\\n\\nhave made a difference in the outcome of her trial. See Richardson-\\n\\nBethea v. State, \\n301 Ga. 859\\n, 865 (2) (\\n804 SE2d 372\\n) (2017)\\n\\n(explaining that the standard is “whether there is a reasonable\\n\\nprobability that the result of the trial would have been different had\\n\\ntrial counsel presented the proffered evidence,” not whether an\\n\\nexpert’s proffered testimony “might conceivably have created some\\n\\ndoubt in the mind of a juror”) (emphasis in original). Accordingly,\\n\\nthis claim fails.\\n\\n     4. Finally, Jennings contends that the combined prejudicial\\n\\neffect of trial court errors and trial counsel’s deficiencies affected the\\n\\noutcome of the trial. See State v. Lane, \\n308 Ga. 10\\n, 17 (1) (\\n838 SE2d\\n\\n808\\n) (2020). To establish cumulative prejudice that warrants a new\\n\\ntrial, Jennings must show that “at least two errors were committed\\n\\nin the course of the trial; and considered together along with the\\n\\nentire record, the multiple errors so infected the jury’s deliberation\\n\\n\\n                                   30\\n that they denied [the defendant] a fundamentally fair trial.” Talley\\n\\nv. State, \\n314 Ga. 153\\n, 166 (4) (\\n875 SE2d 789\\n) (2022).\\n\\n     For the purposes of this analysis, we are assuming trial court\\n\\nerror in Division 2 (admission of the Facebook records), and we have\\n\\nassumed the deficient performance of counsel in Divisions 3 (b)\\n\\n(failure to preserve a certain objection to the admission of the\\n\\nFacebook records) and 3 (c) (ii) (failure to provide notice of the\\n\\ndomestic-violence expert). As discussed above, the evidence against\\n\\nJennings was strong, and the admission of the Facebook records and\\n\\nthe exclusion of the domestic-violence expert were unlikely to have\\n\\naffected the outcome of the trial because Street testified that he sent\\n\\nthe Facebook messages to Jennings (and explained the messages’\\n\\nmeaning) and the expert’s proffered testimony supported a motive\\n\\nfor Jennings wanting to kill Perrin. We note that Perrin’s bank\\n\\nrecords also supported a motive for Jennings wanting Perrin dead,\\n\\nand this motive was unrelated to any sexual misconduct by Perrin.\\n\\nAccordingly, assuming we can combine the assumed evidentiary\\n\\nerror with trial counsel’s assumed deficiencies, we conclude that the\\n\\n\\n                                  31\\n combined prejudicial effect did not deprive Jennings of her right to\\n\\na fundamentally fair trial. See Lofton v. State, \\n309 Ga. 349\\n, 367 (7)\\n\\n(\\n846 SE2d 57\\n) (2020) (concluding that the “cumulative prejudicial\\n\\neffect of the actual and assumed evidentiary errors and counsel’s\\n\\ndeficiencies is not sufficient to outweigh the strength of the properly\\n\\nadmitted evidence of [the defendant’s] guilt”).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

WELCH et\\n     al.\\n\\n      MARKLE, Judge.\\n\\n      After Cynthia Welch was injured and her husband Anthony was killed in a\\n\\nshooting in the parking lot of Pappadeaux Restaurant, she sued Pappas Restaurant\\n\\nGroup, which owned the property, and Tactical Security Group, LLC, which provided\\n\\nthe on-site security guards.1 The trial court denied Pappas’s and Tactical’s motions\\n\\nfor summary judgment, and certified its order for immediate review. We granted the\\n\\ninterlocutory applications, and these appeals followed. After a thorough review of the\\n\\nrecord, and with the benefit of oral argument, we reverse.\\n\\n\\n\\n      1\\n          Welch filed suit individually and as administratrix of her husband’s estate.\\n       To prevail at summary judgment under OCGA § 9-11-56, the moving\\n      party must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact\\n      and that the undisputed facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the\\n      nonmoving party, warrant judgment as a matter of law.

Little-Thomas v. Select Specialty Hosp.-Augusta, \\n333 Ga. App.\\n\\n362\\n, 363 (773 SE2d 480) (2015).\\n\\n      So viewed, the record shows that Pappas owns Pappadeaux and another\\n\\nrestaurant on the same property on Windy Hill Road, with parking lots for each and\\n\\na lower lot for overflow parking. The parking lots are well-lit, and there are\\n\\nsurveillance cameras throughout the area. To patrol the grounds, Pappas hired\\n\\nTactical to provide unarmed, uniformed security guards to deter crime such as\\n\\nautomobile break-ins and loitering, and to assist with traffic issues. On Friday nights,\\n\\ntwo guards were assigned to patrol the lots, and a third guard was stationed in the fire\\n\\nlane in front of Pappadeaux to monitor traffic. The guards patrolled the lots on foot\\n\\nor in marked security cars with flashing lights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n       On Friday, October 7, 2016, Welch and her husband went to dinner at\\n\\nPappadeaux and parked in the lower lot. Because the restaurants were extremely\\n\\ncrowded that night, with customers waiting over an hour to be seated, there were\\n\\nmany people in the parking lot area. Although there were three guards on site most\\n\\nof that evening, one guard left at 10 p.m. After that, one of Tactical’s guards patrolled\\n\\nthe parking lot while the second guard remained stationed in the fire lane. Shortly\\n\\nafter 10 p.m., as the Welches walked through the parking lot back to their car, a man\\n\\nstepped in front of them, demanded their belongings, and then shot both of them.\\n\\nAnthony was killed. The shooter and his accomplices were later captured and\\n\\nconvicted of murder.\\n\\n      Security footage from the surveillance cameras showed the assailants driving\\n\\ninto the lot shortly after 10 p.m. and lingering around their car before the attack. The\\n\\nfootage also confirms that, 60 seconds before the shooting, a guard in a marked\\n\\nsecurity vehicle with the lights flashing patrolled the area where the assailants were\\n\\nlingering and where the attack would occur moments later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           3\\n       Cynthia Welch sued Pappas and Tactical for premises liability, negligence, and\\n\\nwrongful death.2 Pappas and Tactical moved for summary judgment, which the trial\\n\\ncourt denied. We granted the applications for interlocutory review, and these appeals\\n\\nfollowed.\\n\\n                                  Case No. A21A1341\\n\\n      1. In this appeal, Pappas contends that the trial court erred in denying its\\n\\nsummary judgment motion because Welch failed to show that there were substantially\\n\\nsimilar crimes that made the instant attack foreseeable. It further asserts that the trial\\n\\ncourt erred in relying on expert testimony because the expert stated outright that he\\n\\nhad no opinion on foreseeability. We agree that Pappas was entitled to summary\\n\\njudgment.\\n\\n      Under Georgia law, to state a claim for negligence,\\n\\n      the following elements are essential: (1) A legal duty to conform to a\\n      standard of conduct raised by the law for the protection of others against\\n      unreasonable risk of harm; (2) a breach of this standard; (3) a legally\\n      attributable causal connection between the conduct and the resulting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2\\n        Welch’s claims of ordinary negligence are subsumed by her premises liability\\nclaim. See Tomsic v. Marriott Intl., \\n321 Ga. App. 374\\n, 385 (4) (739 SE2d 521)\\n(2013).\\n\\n                                            4\\n       injury; and, (4) some loss or damage flowing to the plaintiff’s legally\\n      protected interest as a result of the alleged breach of the legal duty.\\n\\n\\n(Citation omitted.) Brown v. All-Tech Investment Group, \\n265 Ga. App. 889\\n, 893 (1)\\n\\n(595 SE2d 517) (2003). In Georgia, it is well settled that a proprietor owes its invitees\\n\\na duty “to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises and approaches safe.”3\\n\\nOCGA § 51-3-1. But, “the landowner is not an insurer of an invitee’s safety. An\\n\\nintervening criminal act by a third party generally insulates a landowner from liability\\n\\nunless such criminal act was reasonably foreseeable.” (Citation omitted.) Rautenberg\\n\\nv. Pope, \\n351 Ga. App. 503\\n, 505 (1) (831 SE2d 209) (2019).\\n\\n      Our case law has set forth the way in which a plaintiff can show that the\\n\\ncriminal activity was foreseeable. First, a plaintiff may point to previous crimes that\\n\\nare substantially similar to the one at issue. As our Supreme Court explained,\\n\\n      if the proprietor has reason to anticipate a criminal act, he or she then\\n      has a duty to exercise ordinary care to guard against injury from\\n      dangerous characters. Accordingly, the incident causing the injury must\\n      be substantially similar in type to the previous criminal activities\\n\\n\\n      3\\n         Because the duty to keep the premises safe is non-delegable, Pappas would\\nbe vicariously liable for Tactical’s alleged negligent acts if the criminal activity was\\nforeseeable. See Camelot Club Condo. Assn. v. Afari-Opoku, \\n340 Ga. App. 618\\n, 627\\n(2) (b) (798 SE2d 241) (2017); see also OCGA § 51-2-5.\\n\\n                                           5\\n       occurring on or near the premises so that a reasonable person would take\\n      ordinary precautions to protect his or her customers . . . against the risk\\n      posed by that type of activity.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.)

App.\\n\\nat 505 (1).\\n\\n      In the absence of a substantially similar prior crime, a plaintiff can show\\n\\nforeseeability and avoid summary judgment by proffering other evidence that the\\n\\nproprietor knew of the danger. See Med. Center Hosp. Auth. v. Cavender, \\n331 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 469\\n, 480 (6), n. 13 (771 SE2d 153) (2015); see also Piggly Wiggly Southern v.\\n\\nSnowden, \\n219 Ga.

App.\\n\\n792\\n, 795 (443 SE2d 290) (1994) (numerous crimes in hotel parking lot, as well as in\\n\\nsurrounding areas, many of which were violent crimes, raised question for jury on\\n\\nissue of foreseeability). The touchstone of the inquiry is whether the defendant had\\n\\nknowledge of the risk of criminal activity. Piggly Wiggly Southern, 219 Ga. App. at\\n\\n\\n                                          6\\n 149 (1) (b). Nevertheless, there remains no “duty to anticipate unlikely, remote, or\\n\\nslightly possible events.” (Citation omitted.) Traicoff v. Withers, \\n247 Ga. App. 428\\n,\\n\\n430 (544 SE2d 177) (2000).\\n\\n      Here, the trial court focused on evidence of the frequency of prior property\\n\\ncrimes, and it relied on e-mails from Pappas’s employees and expert testimony\\n\\nproffered by Welch. We consider whether this evidence creates a factual question\\n\\nunder these methods of establishing foreseeability, concluding that it does not.\\n\\n      (a) Substantially similar crimes.\\n\\n      In determining whether previous criminal acts are substantially similar\\n      to the occurrence causing harm, thereby establishing the foreseeability\\n      of risk, the court must inquire into the location, nature and extent of the\\n      prior criminal activities and their likeness, proximity or other\\n      relationship to the crime in question. While the prior criminal activity\\n      must be substantially similar to the particular crime in question, that\\n      does not mean identical. What is required is that the prior incident be\\n      sufficient to attract the [proprietor’s] attention to the dangerous\\n      condition which resulted in the litigated incident. Further, the question\\n      of reasonable foreseeability of a criminal attack is generally for a jury’s\\n      determination rather than summary adjudication by the courts.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.)

However, none of this evidence is sufficient to create a factual\\n\\nquestion on foreseeability.\\n\\n      First, Welch submitted evidence of police reports detailing automobile break-\\n\\nins and thefts on the property from 2011 through 2016, and e-mails between Pappas\\n\\nand Tactical about crime in the general area. It is undisputed that Pappas knew that\\n\\nthere were a large number of break-ins in its lot prior to the shooting. It is also\\n\\nundisputed that the police gave Pappas’s representative a copy of the 2014 crime\\n\\nreports when they met with Pappas that year to discuss the property crime in their lot.\\n\\nHowever, there is no evidence in the record to show that Pappas was aware of the\\n\\npolice reports from 2015 and 2016 that Welch submitted to establish foreseeability.4\\n\\nNor was there evidence that Pappas was aware of any crimes occurring on their lot\\n\\n      4\\n        “There is no authority in this State imposing a duty upon a property owner to\\ninvestigate police files to determine whether criminal activities have occurred on its\\npremises.” Sun Trust Banks v.

App. at 474 (1) (plaintiff has\\n\\nburden to show owner’s knowledge).\\n\\n      Moreover, pretermitting whether the police reports would be admissible, these\\n\\nrecords show that some of the incidents were not similar in nature, likeness, or even\\n\\nlocation to the instant attack. Sturbridge Partners, \\n267 Ga. at 786\\n. There were crimes\\n\\nthat occurred inside the restaurant, rather than the parking lot, or were between\\n\\nemployees. Id.; see also Vega v. La Movida, \\n294 Ga. App. 311\\n, 314 (1) (a) (670 SE2d\\n\\n116) (2008) (in general, crimes that occur in different locations are not substantially\\n\\nsimilar, and incidents occurring in a parking lot cannot show there is a risk of danger\\n\\ninside the restaurant).\\n\\n      Next, Welch submitted depositions from Pappas and Tactical employees.\\n\\nPappas’s security head, Scott Heenan, testified that the guards were there to provide\\n\\na visible deterrent to crime by patrolling, which they had done a minute before the\\n\\nattack. Heenan’s testimony confirmed that Pappas was aware of, and took action to\\n\\nstop, property crimes such as break-ins of unattended cars, and that they had been\\n\\nsuccessful in deterring property crimes in the parking lot. None of Heenan’s\\n\\n                                          9\\n testimony shows any knowledge of similar crimes in the lot or that an attack such as\\n\\nthis one was possible. Bolton, 348 Ga. App. at 762 (1); Vega, 294 Ga. App. at 314 (1)\\n\\n(a).\\n\\n       Joann Altman, one of Pappas’s security managers, acknowledged that Pappas\\n\\nhad a responsibility to oversee the security company and guards used at the property.\\n\\nHer comments confirmed that guards were sometimes on site at the restaurants to\\n\\nescort employees who had parked in remote lots to protect them from crime; however,\\n\\nher comments about the risks of any such criminal activity were not specific to the\\n\\nWindy Hill location of Pappas’s restaurants where the Welches were attacked. Thus,\\n\\nthese comments cannot establish Pappas’s knowledge that such an attack was\\n\\nforeseeable at this location. See Raines v. Maughan, \\n312 Ga. App. 303\\n, 305-306 (2)\\n\\n(a) (718 SE2d 135) (2011) (evidence of carjacking in a location of unknown\\n\\nproximity did not make murder foreseeable); see also Sturbridge Partners, \\n267 Ga.\\n\\nat 786\\n (noting that the court must consider the proximity of the prior crimes in\\n\\nevaluating whether they are similar).\\n\\n       Nor does the testimony from Tactical’s owners create a factual question on the\\n\\nforeseeability of the attack. In e-mails about a year before the shooting, one of\\n\\nTactical’s owners informed Altman its guards and patrols had been a “great deterrent”\\n\\n                                         10\\n and that there had “not been a single break in at the Windy Hill location” despite\\n\\nnews reports of break-ins with armed suspects in surrounding complexes. Altman\\n\\nresponded that they should continue having a second guard on site, and added,\\n\\n“[l]ooks like things are really scary over there.” The week before the shooting\\n\\noccurred, Tactical advised Pappas of an increase in crime in the “area.” And, a few\\n\\ndays before the incident, Tactical notified Altman that there had been 69 car break-ins\\n\\nin “the Atlanta area” in the past week, and that it was “a professional crew that [had]\\n\\nthe police baffled.” Tactical’s owners suggested adding additional guards Monday\\n\\nthrough Thursday nights. Altman responded, “I know it can get crazy out there, but\\n\\nwe have to balance this with our budget[.]”\\n\\n      Nothing about these comments alters the nature of the prior crimes or makes\\n\\nthe shooting foreseeable. Although Altman wrote that the situation was “scary” and\\n\\n“crazy,” such comments do not turn property crimes into a precursor for a bold\\n\\nshooting to occur in the lot during a busy weekend evening. See St. Jude’s Recovery\\n\\nCenter v. Vaughn, \\n354 Ga. App. 593\\n, 596 (2) (841 SE2d 108) (2020). Additionally,\\n\\ninformation that other crimes occurred in the “area” or the “Atlanta area” as opposed\\n\\nto Pappas’s parking lot, or even the street Pappas’s restaurant is on, does not meet the\\n\\nlocation or proximity requirement.

App. 36\\n, 40-41 (1) (520 SE2d 741) (1999) (physical precedent\\n\\nonly) (extent of the prior crimes, owner’s concern over crimes, and location of\\n\\nproperty in high crime area raised jury question on foreseeability).\\n\\n      Finally, Welch submitted testimony from security expert John Villines to create\\n\\na link between the property crimes and the tragic shooting. Villines identified other\\n\\naltercations on the property that evolved into physical confrontations, and he opined\\n\\nthat the security was deficient in numerous ways. With regard to the similarity of the\\n\\nprior crimes, Villines explained that he focused on the similarity of the opportunities\\n\\nfor criminal activity and not the similarities in the nature of the crimes or the\\n\\noutcomes. In other words, Villines stated that the prior car break-ins were similar to\\n\\nthe shooting because, in both cases, he concluded that the lack of sufficient security\\n\\nmeasures made it possible for criminals to enter the lot, avoid detection, commit the\\n\\ncrime, and flee. Villines admitted, however, that he was not asked to, and in fact\\n\\ncould not, render an opinion on the foreseeability of the shooting.\\n\\n      We cannot conclude that Villines’s testimony is sufficient to defeat summary\\n\\njudgment. In evaluating whether the prior instances are substantially similar, we\\n\\nconsider the nature of the crimes; that is, “we consider the key to sufficient similarity\\n\\n                                           12\\n to be not in the details of the crime or even in the degree of force used, but rather in\\n\\nthe nature of the offense: was the prior incident also an offense against a person, or\\n\\nwas it an offense against property[.]” (Citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis in\\n\\noriginal.) Wade v. Findlay Mgmt., \\n253 Ga. App. 688\\n, 690 (560 SE2d 283) (2002).\\n\\nVillines specifically stated that he was not focusing on the nature of the crimes or on\\n\\nwhether the shooting was foreseeable. As a result, his testimony cannot create a\\n\\nfactual question that would preclude summary judgment.\\n\\n      In reaching our conclusion here that the evidence in the record is insufficient\\n\\nto establish that the shooting was foreseeable, the Supreme Court of Georgia’s\\n\\nreasoning in Doe is instructive. See Doe, \\n268 Ga. at 606\\n. In that case, our Supreme\\n\\nCourt explained that prior property crimes that occurred in an apartment building\\n\\nparking deck did not make a subsequent sexual assault foreseeable because “the ‘very\\n\\nnature’ of the thefts and acts of vandalism committed in this case do not suggest that\\n\\npersonal injury may occur.” (Emphasis supplied.) Doe, \\n268 Ga. at 606\\n.\\n\\n      In this case, the shooting occurred in a well-lit and busy parking lot. The prior\\n\\ncrimes committed on Pappas’s property, of which it had knowledge, were limited to\\n\\nvehicle break-ins. The very brazen nature of the shooting — in a busy lot; under a\\n\\nstreetlight; with security patrolling the area — is the complete opposite of the nature\\n\\n                                          13\\n of the break-in of unattended cars. As such, those prior break-ins of unattended\\n\\nvehicles could not have put Pappas on notice that a shooting might occur. Doe, \\n268\\n\\nGa. at 606\\n; see also Agnes Scott College v. Clark, \\n273 Ga. App. 619\\n (616 SE2d 468)\\n\\n(2005) (break-ins of unoccupied cars without personal contact did not make\\n\\nsubsequent abduction foreseeable); Baker v. Simon Property Group, \\n273 Ga. App.\\n\\n406\\n, 407-408 (1) (614 SE2d 793) (2005) (summary judgment proper where prior\\n\\ncrimes in parking lot, including thefts from unoccupied cars, and stolen vehicles, did\\n\\nnot make carjacking and shooting foreseeable); Ritz Carlton Hotel Co. v. Revel, \\n216\\n\\nGa. App. 300\\n, 303 (1) (454 SE2d 183) (1995) (rape and robbery of a hotel guest in\\n\\nher room was not foreseeable where there were only prior incidents of theft and no\\n\\nviolent assaults); compare Wal-Mart Stores v. Lee, \\n290 Ga. App. 541\\n, 548 (3) (a) (659\\n\\nSE2d 905) (2008) (finding instances of robberies and assaults with a weapon, along\\n\\nwith property stolen from cars in the parking lot, made carjacking foreseeable because\\n\\nit was “reasonable to anticipate that an unauthorized entry into a vehicle might occur\\n\\nwhen the driver was nearby and that personal harm to the driver would result.”). In\\n\\nfact, the only similarity between this crime and the prior activity is that the crimes\\n\\noccurred in Pappas’s parking lot. But that is not enough to make the shooting\\n\\nforeseeable. See Retail Property Trust v. McPhaul, \\n359 Ga. App. 345\\n, 349 (1) (a)\\n\\n                                         14\\n (857 SE2d 521, 526 (1) (a)) (2021); Wade, 253 Ga.

App. at\\n\\n506 (prior property crimes in tractor-trailer parking lot made subsequent attack\\n\\nforeseeable because security company was hired to prevent such crimes and the\\n\\nplaintiff’s injuries arose from those crimes “as opposed to . . . a sudden intentional\\n\\nassault performed in an area known for minor theft.”). As a result, when we inquire\\n\\ninto the nature, location, and extent of the prior thefts from unoccupied cars, we\\n\\nconclude that these crimes are not substantially similar to the shooting such that they\\n\\nwould have alerted Pappas to the risk of the instant attack, and thus they do not\\n\\nestablish that the shooting was foreseeable.\\n\\n      (b) Alternate means of showing foreseeability.\\n\\n      Welch also asserted that she could show that the shooting was foreseeable by\\n\\npointing to Pappas’s knowledge of the danger or the fact that the extent of the prior\\n\\ncrimes is so great that it would put Pappas on notice.5 See Shoney’s v. Hudson, \\n218\\n\\nGa. App. 171\\n, 173 (460 SE2d 809) (1995), overruled in part on other grounds by,\\n\\n\\n      5\\n         We have described this as two different methods for showing foreseeability\\nin the absence of a substantially similar prior crime: (1) “a danger could be so obvious\\nthat an issue for jury determination could exist regarding notice and/or foreseeability\\ndespite the absence of a prior similar incident on those premises;” and (2) a\\ndefendant’s acknowledgment of the danger.

To establish this\\n\\nknowledge, Welch points to the e-mails between Pappas and Tactical as well as\\n\\nAltman’s testimony that Pappas had guards present to protect employees from a\\n\\npossible robbery as they walked to their cars. But the mere acknowledgment that a\\n\\nrobbery could happen does not make it “probable, according to ordinary and usual\\n\\nexperience.” (Citation and punctuation omitted). Goldstein, Garber & Salama v. J.\\n\\nB., \\n300 Ga. 840\\n, 842 (1) (797 SE2d 87) (2017); see also Traicoff, 247 Ga. App. at 430\\n\\n(there is no duty “to anticipate unlikely, remote, or slightly possible events.”) (citation\\n\\nomitted ). The e-mails and testimony do not rise to that level of probability.\\n\\n       As noted, the e-mails reference incidents in the “area” and not specifically\\n\\nPappas’s property. General crime statistics are insufficient to raise a question of fact\\n\\non the foreseeability of risk. See Agnes Scott College, 273 Ga. App. at 622-623 (1).\\n\\nNor do the references to an undefined “area” establish that Pappas knew the Windy\\n\\nHill location was a high crime area.\\n\\n       Welch contends that the extent of the prior property crimes showed that there\\n\\nwere problems with security, thus making the shooting foreseeable. See Woodall, 239\\n\\nGa. App. at 40 (1). But “[o]ne is not bound to anticipate or foresee and provide\\n\\nagainst that which is unusual or that which is only remotely and slightly probable.”\\n\\n                                            17\\n (Citation omitted.) Brown, 265 Ga. App. at 894 (1). Here, there was no evidence of\\n\\nviolence occurring in the parking lot or the use of firearms, only break-ins of\\n\\nunoccupied cars. This is insufficient to establish Pappas’s knowledge of a risk. See\\n\\nBoone v. Udoto, \\n323 Ga. App. 482\\n, 485-486 (1) (747 SE2d 76) (2013) (victim injured\\n\\nwhen struck with gun failed to show conduct was foreseeable where there was no\\n\\nknowledge of likelihood of crime, no prior incidents involving guns, and no other\\n\\naltercations involving weapons); see also Johnson v. MARTA, \\n230 Ga. App. 105\\n, 106\\n\\n(1) (495 SE2d 583) (1998) (number of prior crimes, none of which were violent, did\\n\\nnot put MARTA on notice of a violent knife assault). As a result, we must conclude\\n\\nthat the trial court erred in denying Pappas’s motion for summary judgment because\\n\\nWelch failed to raise a question of fact as to whether the shooting was foreseeable.6\\n\\n                               Case No. A21A1342.\\n\\n      2. In its appeal, Tactical argues that it was entitled to summary judgment\\n\\nbecause it had no duty towards the Welches as either third-party beneficiaries to its\\n\\ncontract with Pappas, or under Restatement (Second) of Torts § 324A.7 It contends\\n\\n      6\\n        In light of this conclusion, we need not address Pappas’s argument that Welch\\nfailed to establish causation.\\n      7\\n          Restatement (Second) of Torts § 324A provides:\\n\\n\\n                                         18\\n there was no evidence to show the crime was foreseeable, and it urges this Court to\\n\\nengage in a public policy analysis to prevent holding it to a higher standard – that of\\n\\npreventing all harm. We agree that Tactical was entitled to summary judgment.\\n\\n      First, Welch was not a third party beneficiary of the security contract. As we\\n\\nhave explained,\\n\\n      [i]n personal injury cases, an injured party may not recover as a\\n      third-party beneficiary for failure to perform a duty imposed by a\\n      contract unless it is apparent from the language of the agreement that the\\n      contracting parties intended to confer a direct benefit upon the plaintiff\\n      to protect him from physical injury. Furthermore, [a]lthough the\\n      third-party beneficiary need not be specifically named in the contract,\\n\\n\\n      One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render\\n      services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the\\n      protection of a third person or his things, is subject to liability to the\\n      third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise\\n      reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if (a) his failure to exercise\\n      reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or (b) he has undertaken\\n      to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person, or (c) the harm\\n      is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the\\n      undertaking.\\n\\n\\nGeorgia adopted the rule regarding liability to third persons for the negligent\\nperformance of an undertaking under § 324A in Huggins v. Aetna Casualty & Surety\\nCo., \\n245 Ga. 248\\n, 249 (264 SE2d 191) (1980).\\n\\n                                          19\\n       the contracting parties’ intention to benefit the third party must be\\n      shown on the face of the contract. The mere fact that the third party\\n      would benefit from performance of the agreement is not alone sufficient.\\n      And as we have stated before, we recognize that whenever a premises\\n      owner contracts with a private security company the parties may expect\\n      the security services provided to benefit invitees who visit the property.\\n      As we have held, however, an injured invitee may not recover against\\n      the security company for negligent performance if the contract is silent\\n      as to the parties’ intent to confer that benefit.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Cavender, 331 Ga. App. at 478 (4); see also Fair\\n\\nv. C V Underground, \\n340 Ga. App. 790\\n, 794-795 (2) (798 SE2d 358) (2017). Here,\\n\\npretermitting whether the unsigned contract was even in effect, nothing in the\\n\\nlanguage of the contract indicated an intent to confer a benefit to third parties.\\n\\n      To the extent that Welch argues that the Restatement creates a duty to the\\n\\nWelches irrespective of the contract or Pappas’s duty, we are not convinced.8 We\\n\\nhave never applied the Restatement in this manner. See Brown, 265 Ga. App. at 898\\n\\n(2) (a) (ii) (explaining that our courts have applied Restatement § 324A to cases\\n\\n      8\\n        Welch points to the copy of “Pappas Parking lot Guard Expectations,” which\\ninstructed that guards were to deter criminal activities, look for any suspicious\\nactivity in the lot, including loitering, and watch to be sure any individuals walking\\nalone safely enter their cars. But the parties point to no evidence in the record, and\\nwe have found none, showing that Pappas ever gave this document to Tactical or any\\nof the guards.\\n\\n                                          20\\n involving an insurer’s performance of an undertaking to inspect or the failure to warn\\n\\nagainst workplace hazards, and other states have applied it to the maintenance of\\n\\ntraffic signals). Even if we were to extend the Restatement to these types of premises\\n\\nliability claims, because the crime was not foreseeable, as discussed in Division 1,\\n\\nTactical would be entitled to summary judgment.

However, the court failed to explain how it calculated the deviation and did not include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children. According to OCGA § 19-6-15, any deviation from the presumptive amount of child support must be justified by special circumstances and must be in the best interests of the child.

For example, in the case involving the husband\\'s child support obligation, the court was required to explain how it calculated the deviation and to include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children and would not seriously impair the husband\\'s ability to provide for them.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the case involving grandparent visitation, the court must consider whether the welfare of the child would be harmed without such visitation and make specific written findings of fact to support its decision. The court must also address any constitutional challenges raised, although such challenges may be deemed moot if they no longer benefit the party seeking relief.\\n\\nOverall, the \"best interests of the child\" standard is a comprehensive and flexible guideline that allows the court to consider a wide range of factors to ensure that the child\\'s welfare is prioritized in custody and visitation decisions.', 'source_documents': [Document(page_content=\"1. The trial court's order includes a finding that husband earned gross monthly income of $5,483.56, approximately 65 percent of the parties' combined income. After determining a basic child support obligation of $1,582 for the parties' two minor children, the court calculated husband's pro rata share of the basic child support obligation to be $986.75. As evidenced in Schedule E attached to the court's order, however, the court applied a parenting time deviation of $434.66, reducing husband's monthly child support obligation to $552.09. See OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(K). Husband does not on appeal challenge the court's decision to deviate from the presumptive child support obligation. Instead, he contends the trial court erred by failing to explain how the court calculated the deviation and failing to include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children and would not seriously impair his ability to provide for the children. We agree.\\nBecause the trial court's order in this case was entered after July 1, 2008, the revised child support guidelines in OCGA § 19-6-15, including the 2008 amendments thereto, are applicable. See Rumley-Miawama v. Miawama, 284 Ga. 811(1), 671 S.E.2d 827 (2009). The revised guidelines permit the fact-finder to deviate\\nfrom the presumptive amount of child support when special circumstances make the presumptive amount of child support excessive or inadequate due to extended parenting time as set forth in the order of visitation or when the child resides with both parents equally.\", metadata={'source': 'opinion_text/1327652_Turner v.

Husband also agreed to pay wife $11,000 representing her interest in the marital residence. Left unresolved and submitted to the trial court for determination were issues of child support and the division of extracurricular expenses. The parties waived a hearing, and after an in-chambers conference, the court entered a final judgment and divorce decree which incorporated the partial settlement agreement, ordered husband to pay $552.09 in monthly child support, and apportioned the expenses for the children's extracurricular activities two-thirds to husband and one-third to wife.

The court may also consider the child\\'s own wishes if the child is of sufficient age and maturity to express a preference.'), (\"Explain the concept of 'best interests of the child.'\", 'The concept of the \"best interests of the child\" is a legal standard used in family law to determine the most favorable arrangement for a child\\'s well-being and development. This principle is paramount in decisions regarding child custody, visitation, and support. The goal is to ensure that the child\\'s physical, emotional, and psychological needs are met in the best possible way.\\n\\nIn the context of the cases provided:\\n\\n1. **Child Support and Parenting Time Deviation (OCGA § 19-6-15)**:\\n   - In the first case, the trial court applied a parenting time deviation to reduce the husband\\'s child support obligation. However, the court failed to explain how it calculated the deviation and did not include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children. According to OCGA § 19-6-15, any deviation from the presumptive amount of child support must be justified by special circumstances and must be in the best interests of the child. The court must explicitly state that the deviation will not seriously impair the parent\\'s ability to provide for the child. This ensures that the child\\'s needs are prioritized over the financial convenience of the parents.\\n\\n2. **Custody and Parental Rights (Johnson v. Smith)**:\\n   - In the second case, the court dealt with the issue of custody and the surrender of parental rights. The court emphasized the importance of strict compliance with adoption statutes to protect the child\\'s best interests. The intended adoption failed because Ms. Johnson did not sign the necessary documents, and the court ruled that an invalid consent to adoption cannot be converted into a valid contractual release of parental rights. This decision underscores the principle that any action affecting a child\\'s custody or parental rights must be meticulously followed to ensure the child\\'s best interests are safeguarded.\\n\\nIn summary, the \"best interests of the child\" standard requires courts to consider various factors, including the child\\'s safety, emotional needs, stability, and the ability of each parent to meet those needs. Courts must provide clear and explicit findings to justify their decisions, ensuring that the child\\'s welfare is the primary concern in any legal determination.'), ('What is the standard for determining child custody in Georgia?', 'In Georgia, the standard for determining child custody is the \"best interests of the child.\" This standard is codified in OCGA § 19-9-3(a)(2), which requires the court to consider the best interests of the child in making any custody determination.

For example, in the case involving the husband\\'s child support obligation, the court was required to explain how it calculated the deviation and to include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children and would not seriously impair the husband\\'s ability to provide for them.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the case involving grandparent visitation, the court must consider whether the welfare of the child would be harmed without such visitation and make specific written findings of fact to support its decision. The court must also address any constitutional challenges raised, although such challenges may be deemed moot if they no longer benefit the party seeking relief.\\n\\nOverall, the \"best interests of the child\" standard is a comprehensive and flexible guideline that allows the court to consider a wide range of factors to ensure that the child\\'s welfare is prioritized in custody and visitation decisions.', 'source_documents': [Document(page_content=\"1. The trial court's order includes a finding that husband earned gross monthly income of $5,483.56, approximately 65 percent of the parties' combined income. After determining a basic child support obligation of $1,582 for the parties' two minor children, the court calculated husband's pro rata share of the basic child support obligation to be $986.75. As evidenced in Schedule E attached to the court's order, however, the court applied a parenting time deviation of $434.66, reducing husband's monthly child support obligation to $552.09. See OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(K). Husband does not on appeal challenge the court's decision to deviate from the presumptive child support obligation. Instead, he contends the trial court erred by failing to explain how the court calculated the deviation and failing to include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children and would not seriously impair his ability to provide for the children. We agree.\\nBecause the trial court's order in this case was entered after July 1, 2008, the revised child support guidelines in OCGA § 19-6-15, including the 2008 amendments thereto, are applicable.

Raymond filed for divorce in January 2008. The parties reached a partial settlement agreement which provided, inter alia, that husband and wife would share joint legal and physical custody of their two minor children, the custody arrangement being structured so husband is to have physical custody of the children from Friday a.m. until Tuesday a.m., and wife is to have physical custody from Tuesday a.m. through Friday a.m., with exceptions for holidays and other special occasions. Husband also agreed to pay wife $11,000 representing her interest in the marital residence. Left unresolved and submitted to the trial court for determination were issues of child support and the division of extracurricular expenses. The parties waived a hearing, and after an in-chambers conference, the court entered a final judgment and divorce decree which incorporated the partial settlement agreement, ordered husband to pay $552.09 in monthly child support, and apportioned the expenses for the children's extracurricular activities two-thirds to husband and one-third to wife.
