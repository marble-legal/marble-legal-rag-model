Sch'}\"}, page_content='                                    SYLLABUS\\n\\nThis syllabus is not part of the Court’s opinion. It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n    Amada Sanjuan v. School District of West New York (A-45-22) (087515)\\n\\nArgued November 29, 2023 -- Decided February 12, 2024\\n\\nSOLOMON, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court considers whether N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 limits an\\narbitrator’s discretion to penalize conduct under the Tenure Employees Hearing Law\\n(TEHL), N.J.S.A. 18A:6-10 to -18.1.\\n\\n      Defendant, the Board of Education for the Town of West New York Public\\nSchools (the Board), hired plaintiff Amada Sanjuan as a teacher in the early 1990s.\\nIn 2019, the Board appointed Sanjuan assistant principal of Memorial High School.\\nShe acquired tenure both as a teacher and as an assistant principal.\\n\\n       In August 2020, the Board certified tenure charges against Sanjuan for\\nconduct unbecoming. Sanjuan reported that she fell down a staircase at the school\\nafter reaching to pick up a piece of paper, but security footage showed that after\\nSanjuan fell, she reached into her pocketbook, took out a piece of paper, set it down\\nin the middle of the staircase, and then resumed her position on the floor. Pursuant\\nto N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16, the Commissioner of Education deemed the charges\\n“sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction in salary of the person charged” and\\nreferred the case to an arbitrator.\\n\\n       The arbitrator concluded that the limited scope of the incident and Sanjuan’s\\nlong service with the public school district as a teacher warranted a demotion, not\\ntermination. He terminated her tenured administrative position but allowed Sanjuan\\nto retain her tenured teaching role. The arbitrator further concluded that Sanjuan’s\\n“failure to take ownership” of her misdeed “warrants that her reinstatement . . . be\\nwithout backpay.”\\n\\n        Sanjuan filed a verified complaint and order to show cause seeking to vacate\\nthe arbitration award and to be reinstated as a tenured administrator with backpay.\\nThe trial court confirmed the arbitration award. The Appellate Division vacated the\\ntrial court’s order. \\n473 N.J. Super. 416\\n, 429 (App. Div. 2022). The appellate court\\ninterpreted N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 to allow sustained tenure charges to result only in\\ntermination or loss of salary and noted that “[n]owhere does the statute provide that\\n\\n                                          1\\n an employee can be demoted.” \\nId. at 426\\n. The Court granted certification. \\n254 N.J.\\n90\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 provides the basis to refer a case to arbitration but does\\nnot limit an arbitrator’s authority to impose penalties. The award here is reinstated.\\n\\n1. The Court reviews the history of the TEHL from its enactment in 1967 through\\nits amendment in 2012 via the Teacher Effectiveness and Accountability for the\\nChildren of New Jersey Act (TEACHNJ), N.J.S.A. 18A:6-117 to -129. TEACHNJ\\neliminated the agency review process of tenure charges in place under the TEHL and\\ninstead directed that contested cases be submitted to arbitration. N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16\\nprovides that, if the Commissioner of Education finds that tenure charges are\\n“sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction in salary of the person charged, [the\\nCommissioner] shall refer the case to an arbitrator.” Although the TEACHNJ\\namendments to the TEHL changed the entity that makes the final determination in a\\ncase, it did not make any changes as to what could or should be the final\\ndetermination. (pp. 10-13)\\n\\n2. The Court clarifies the nature of the challenge to the arbitrator’s award here and\\nthe standard governing its review of that award. (pp. 13-15)\\n\\n3. N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 sets forth the conditions under which a matter must be\\nreferred to arbitration by the Commissioner; it does not set forth, limit, or in any\\nway address the penalties that may be imposed by an arbitrator to whom a matter is\\nreferred. The Legislature could have limited the possible penalties that a tenured\\nemployee could face under the amended TEHL but did not. Cases applying the\\nTEHL have accordingly recognized the broad discretion to fashion an appropriate\\nremedy when imposing a penalty for tenure charges. The Court reviews relevant\\nexamples. Because N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 does not limit the possible penalties to\\nreduction in salary and termination, and because there is no contractual agreement\\nhere that sets limits beyond those imposed by the TEHL, the Court finds that the\\narbitrator did not exceed his powers in demoting Sanjuan and instead correctly\\ndetermined a penalty tailored to this case. In light of that holding, the Court does\\nnot reach whether the arbitrator would be estopped from reconsidering his decision\\nabout termination if that were the only available remedy. (pp. 15-20)\\n\\n      REVERSED. The arbitrator’s award is REINSTATED.\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, PIERRE-LOUIS,\\nWAINER APTER, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE SOLOMON’s opinion.\\nJUSTICE FASCIALE did not participate.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n        SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\\n             A-45 September Term 2022\\n                       087515\\n\\n\\n                   Amada Sanjuan,\\n\\n                Plaintiff-Respondent,\\n\\n                          v.\\n\\n         School District of West New York,\\n                 Hudson County,\\n\\n                Defendant-Appellant.\\n\\n       On certification to the Superior Court,\\n   Appellate Division, whose opinion is reported at\\n       473 N.J.

Schwartz\\n             and Jordan Shead, on the brief).\\n\\n\\n            JUSTICE SOLOMON delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n      When a school district files tenure charges against an employee, the\\n\\nTenure Employees Hearing Law (TEHL), N.J.S.A. 18A:6-10 to -18.1, requires\\n\\nthat the State Commissioner of Education refer the case to arbitration upon\\n\\ndetermining that the charges are “sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction\\n\\nin salary of the person charged.” N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16. This appeal requires that\\n\\nwe determine the limits of an arbitrator’s discretion to penalize conduct under\\n\\nthe TEHL.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division determined that the language of N.J.S.A.\\n\\n18A:6-16 constrains the arbitrator to impose only the penalties of dismissal or\\n\\nreduction in salary, not demotion. We disagree and hold that N.J.S.A.\\n\\n18A:6-16 provides the basis to refer a case to arbitration but does not limit an\\n\\narbitrator’s authority to impose penalties.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Defendant, the Board of Education for the Town of West New York\\n\\nPublic Schools (the Board), hired plaintiff Amada Sanjuan as a teacher in the\\n\\n                                        2\\n early 1990s. She acquired tenure for that position in 2001. In August 2019,\\n\\nthe Board appointed Sanjuan assistant principal of Memorial High School, and\\n\\nshe later acquired tenure for that role as well.\\n\\n      On February 12, 2020, Sanjuan attended an evening event at the school\\n\\nas part of her duties as assistant principal. At the event, on the way to meet\\n\\nparents in the cafeteria, Sanjuan fell down a staircase.\\n\\n      The following day, Kathleen Fradera, the Board’s benefits coordinator,\\n\\ndirected Sanjuan to fill out an illness and injury report. After speaking with\\n\\nSanjuan, Fradera wrote: “The employee saw a piece of paper on the steps, and\\n\\nshe slipped/lost her balance. She fell down the entire set of steps and landed\\n\\non her back hitting her head on the concrete . . . .”\\n\\n      A school security camera captured Sanjuan’s fall on video. The same\\n\\nday that Sanjuan filled out her report, the high school’s principal and the\\n\\nassistant superintendent watched the security footage of the fall. The video\\n\\nshowed that after Sanjuan fell, she reached into her pocketbook, took out a\\n\\npiece of paper, set it down in the middle of the staircase, and then resumed her\\n\\nposition on the floor.\\n\\n      Two weeks later, Sanjuan and her union representative met with the\\n\\nassistant superintendent and the Board’s administrative assistant to discuss the\\n\\naccident report and the possibility that it was false. Sanjuan repeated that she\\n\\n\\n                                         3\\n fell after seeing a piece of paper on the staircase and reaching to pick it up.\\n\\nAfter being shown the security camera footage, Sanjuan claimed to be “just as\\n\\nsurprised as everybody else.” The Board thereafter placed Sanjuan on\\n\\nadministrative leave.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      On August 31, 2020, the Board certified tenure charges against Sanjuan\\n\\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:6-10, suspended her without pay, and sought her\\n\\ndismissal for conduct unbecoming. The Commissioner then considered the\\n\\ncharges filed, the relevant evidence, and Sanjuan’s response. Pursuant to\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 18A:6-16, the Commissioner deemed the charges “sufficient to\\n\\nwarrant dismissal or reduction in salary of the person charged” and referred the\\n\\ncase to an arbitrator under N.J.S.A. 18A:6-17.1.\\n\\n      Following a virtual hearing, the arbitrator issued a written decision\\n\\nconcluding that Sanjuan’s “conduct justified a penalty,” but one “less severe\\n\\nthan” dismissal. In reaching that conclusion, the arbitrator considered the\\n\\nmitigating factors discussed in In re Fulcomer, \\n93 N.J. Super. 404\\n, 421-22\\n\\n(App. Div. 1967) (considering length of service, the harsh impact of dismissal\\n\\non an individual’s career, and a favorable teaching record), and determined\\n\\nthat the limited scope of the incident and Sanjuan’s long service with the\\n\\npublic school district as a teacher warranted a demotion, not termination. As a\\n\\n\\n                                         4\\n result, the arbitrator terminated her tenured administrative position but allowed\\n\\nSanjuan to retain her tenured teaching role. The arbitrator further concluded\\n\\nthat Sanjuan’s “failure to take ownership” of her misdeed “warrants that her\\n\\nreinstatement . . . be without backpay.”\\n\\n                                       C.\\n\\n      Sanjuan filed a verified complaint and order to show cause seeking to\\n\\nvacate the arbitration award and to be reinstated as a tenured administrator\\n\\nwith backpay. The trial court denied plaintiff’s order to show cause and\\n\\nconfirmed the arbitration award, reasoning that N.J.S.A. 18A:28-5\\n\\n“contemplates a remedy short of termination when it mentions ‘reduction in\\n\\ncompensation.’” Deriving guidance from this Court’s decision in Linden\\n\\nBoard of Education v. Linden Education Ass’n, \\n202 N.J. 268\\n (2010), the court\\n\\ndetermined that arbitrators are empowered to impose an alternate, fair\\n\\npunishment in the absence of just cause for termination. The court also\\n\\naffirmed the arbitrator’s denial of back pay to Sanjuan because Sanjuan failed\\n\\nto show any “fraud, corruption, or similar wrongdoing on the part of the\\n\\narbitrator” that would justify vacating the award under N.J.S.A. 2A:24-8.\\n\\n      Sanjuan appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in finding that the\\n\\narbitrator had not exceeded his statutory authority by demoting her from\\n\\ntenured assistant principal to tenured teacher. The Appellate Division agreed,\\n\\n\\n                                           5\\n vacated the trial court’s order upholding the arbitrator’s award, and remanded\\n\\nthe matter to the arbitrator to issue a supplemental award limited to any further\\n\\nsuspension without pay. Sanjuan v. Sch. Dist. of W. N.Y., \\n473 N.J. Super.\\n\\n416\\n, 429 (App. Div. 2022). The Appellate Division rejected the Board’s\\n\\nrequest to remand the case to the arbitrator to reconsider Sanjuan’s\\n\\ntermination, stating that “[t]he arbitrator has already determined that Sanjuan\\n\\nshould not be terminated; therefore, we discern no legal equitable basis to have\\n\\nhim revisit that ruling.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      In vacating the arbitration award, the Appellate Division found that the\\n\\nplain language of N.J.S.A. 18A:6-10 and -16 does not grant an arbitrator the\\n\\nauthority to impose demotion as a penalty. \\nId. at 425-26\\n. The court reasoned\\n\\nthat N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 “provides that tenure charges that are sustained against\\n\\na tenured teaching staff member can only result in termination or depriv[ation\\n\\nof] salary,” and “[n]owhere does the statute provide that an employee can be\\n\\ndemoted.” \\nId. at 426\\n.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division noted that it had “found no case law upholding\\n\\nthe penalty of demoting a tenured teaching staff member to a lower-titled,\\n\\npreviously held tenured classroom teaching position” since the enactment of\\n\\nthe TEHL. \\nId. at 427\\n. The court found the trial court’s reliance on Fulcomer\\n\\nand Linden misplaced because Fulcomer dealt with a dispute prior to the\\n\\n\\n                                        6\\n TEHL and thus did not involve an arbitrator while Linden concerned an\\n\\narbitrator’s decision under a collective bargaining agreement not present here.\\n\\nSee \\nid. at 427-28\\n (discussing Fulcomer, \\n93 N.J. Super. at 421-22\\n, and Linden,\\n\\n202 N.J. at 270-71). The appellate court also found an unpublished Appellate\\n\\nDivision decision discussed by the trial court to be inapplicable. Ibid.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division concluded that because the Legislature “chose\\n\\nnot to include demotion as a penalty for a teaching staff member, an arbitrator\\n\\nhas no authority to impose that form of disciplinary action.” Id. at 429.\\n\\n      The Board petitioned for certification, asking us to review (1) whether\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 18A:6-10 and -16 limit an arbitrator’s authority in setting a penalty to\\n\\neither a dismissal or a reduction in pay in general and (2) if so, whether the\\n\\narbitrator in this case should be able to reconsider termination. We granted the\\n\\npetition. \\n254 N.J. 90\\n (2023). We also granted leave to the New Jersey\\n\\nEducation Association (NJEA) and the New Jersey Principal and Supervisors\\n\\nAssociation (NJPSA) to appear as amici curiae.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n      The Board argues that the Appellate Division erred in vacating the\\n\\narbitrator’s decision demoting Sanjuan to a tenured teaching position because\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 does not restrict an arbitrator’s options to “dismissal” or “a\\n\\nreduction in salary.” The Board further contends that the plain language of the\\n\\n\\n                                        7\\n statute “places absolutely no restriction” on an arbitrator’s ability to fashion an\\n\\nappropriate remedy, but rather provides conditional language which relates to\\n\\nwhether the matter may be transmitted to arbitration. Alternatively, the Board\\n\\nasserts that if this Court finds that the statute limits the arbitrator’s available\\n\\npenalties, the case should be remanded so that the arbitrator can reconsider\\n\\nwhether Sanjuan should be terminated.\\n\\n      Amicus the NJEA supports the Board and argues that the Appellate\\n\\nDivision’s decision should be reversed because it contravenes (1) the statute’s\\n\\nplain meaning, the Legislature’s intent, and decades of tenure law;\\n\\n(2) precedent affording arbitrators wide discretion in public sector arbitrations;\\n\\nand (3) the notion of progressive discipline.\\n\\n      Amicus the NJPSA also joins the Board and the NJEA, arguing that the\\n\\nAppellate Division’s ruling should be reversed because the decision\\n\\n(1) imposes additional constraints on an arbitrator’s remedial authority that the\\n\\nLegislature did not authorize and (2) conflicts with the longstanding\\n\\ninterpretation of the state’s tenure laws.\\n\\n      Sanjuan argues that, based on the language of N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16, the\\n\\nAppellate Division properly determined that the arbitrator exceeded his\\n\\nauthority by demoting her. She posits that the Appellate Division was not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          8\\n required to look past the provision’s plain language and that the relevant case\\n\\nlaw supports the Appellate Division’s interpretation.\\n\\n      Sanjuan further asserts that, on remand, the doctrine of collateral\\n\\nestoppel precludes the arbitrator from reconsidering termination because the\\n\\narbitrator already had an opportunity to consider that punishment and chose\\n\\nnot to implement it.\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Because the TEHL governs proceedings on disciplinary charges against\\n\\ntenured school administrators and teachers, we begin our discussion with a\\n\\nbrief review of the statute, both before and after its amendment by the Teacher\\n\\nEffectiveness and Accountability for the Children of New Jersey Act\\n\\n(TEACHNJ), N.J.S.A. 18A:6-117 to -129. In doing so, we are mindful that\\n\\nquestions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo, and our aim is “to\\n\\neffectuate the Legislature’s intent.” W.S. v. Hildreth, \\n252 N.J. 506\\n, 518-19\\n\\n(2023). The best evidence of such intent “is the statutory language,” read in\\n\\naccordance with its “ordinary meaning and significance and . . . in context with\\n\\nrelated provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a whole.” \\nIbid.\\n (first\\n\\nquoting State v. Lane, \\n251 N.J. 84\\n, 94 (2022); and then quoting DiProspero v.\\n\\nPenn, \\n183 N.J. 477\\n, 492 (2005)).\\n\\n\\n                                         9\\n       “[W]hen a literal interpretation of individual statutory terms or\\n\\nprovisions would lead to results inconsistent with the overall purpose of the\\n\\nstatute, that interpretation should be rejected.” In re Civ. Commitment of\\n\\nW.W., \\n245 N.J. 438\\n, 449 (2021) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\\n\\nHubbard v. Reed, \\n168 N.J. 387\\n, 392-93 (2001)). If we determine that an\\n\\n“ambiguity in the statutory language . . . leads to more than one plausible\\n\\ninterpretation, we may turn to extrinsic evidence, ‘including legislative history,\\n\\ncommittee reports, and contemporaneous construction.’” DiProspero, \\n183 N.J.\\n\\nat 492-93\\n (quoting Cherry Hill Manor Assocs. v. Faugno, \\n182 N.J. 64\\n, 75\\n\\n(2004)).\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      In 1967, the Legislature enacted the TEHL to replace the Tenure\\n\\nEmployees Hearing Act. L. 1967, c. 271. The TEHL originally provided that\\n\\nif the Commissioner of Education determined that a tenure charge was\\n\\n“sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction in salary of the person charged,”\\n\\nthen the Commissioner would conduct a hearing. See \\nibid.\\n In 1998, the\\n\\nLegislature amended the statute to mandate a hearing before an Administrative\\n\\nLaw Judge (ALJ) if the Commissioner deemed the charges sufficient. L. 1998,\\n\\nc. 42, § 2. The TEHL did not set forth the penalties that could be imposed for\\n\\ncharges sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction in salary.\\n\\n\\n                                        10\\n       In 2012, the Legislature amended the TEHL with the passage of\\n\\nTEACHNJ. L. 2012, c. 26. Today, “[p]ursuant to TEACHNJ, the agency\\n\\nreview process no longer exists,” and instead, contested cases must be\\n\\nsubmitted to arbitration. Pugliese v. State-Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark, \\n440\\n\\nN.J. Super. 501\\n, 510 (App. Div. 2015).\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 18A:6-10 provides that no tenured employee of the public\\n\\nschool system “shall be dismissed or reduced in compensation . . . except for\\n\\ninefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct, or other just cause.” Charges\\n\\nmade against tenured employees must be filed by the complainant with the\\n\\nappropriate board of education, which then determines “whether there is\\n\\nprobable cause to credit the evidence in support of the charge and whether\\n\\nsuch charge, if credited, is sufficient to warrant a dismissal or reduction of\\n\\nsalary.” N.J.S.A. 18A:6-11. If the board answers both questions in the\\n\\naffirmative, “then it shall forward such written charge to the [C]ommissioner\\n\\n[of Education] for a hearing pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16, together with a\\n\\ncertificate of such determination.” \\nIbid.\\n If, in turn, the Commissioner finds\\n\\nthat the charges are “sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction in salary of\\n\\nthe person charged, [the Commissioner] shall refer the case to an arbitrator\\n\\npursuant to” N.J.S.A. 18A:6-17.1 for further proceedings. N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        11\\n       The statute’s “if x, then y” structure -- if the Commissioner determines\\n\\nthe charges are “sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction in salary,” then\\n\\nthe Commissioner “shall refer the case to an arbitration” -- is a common\\n\\nformat for imposing a condition. See Black’s Law Dictionary 366 (11th ed.\\n\\n2019) (giving, as an example of a “condition,” the following: “if Jones\\n\\npromises to pay Smith $500 for repairing a car, Smith’s failure to repair the car\\n\\nrelieves Jones of the promise to pay” (emphasis added)).\\n\\n      Thus, TEACHNJ limited the contested cases that may be submitted to\\n\\narbitration by the Commissioner to those in which the charges are “sufficient\\n\\nto warrant dismissal or reduction in salary of the person charged” -- but it did\\n\\nnot set forth the penalties that could be imposed by an arbitrator to whom a\\n\\nmatter is referred. Indeed, the Sponsors’ Statement to TEACHNJ does not\\n\\nsignal any substantive change to the review of contested tenure cases, only the\\n\\nprocedural change of submitting cases to arbitration rather than agency review:\\n\\n            This bill will also require binding arbitration for\\n            contested cases involving the dismissal or reduction in\\n            compensation of tenured employees of a school district.\\n            These contested cases will no longer be referred to\\n            [ALJs], and the final determination on the case will no\\n            longer be made by the Commissioner of Education,\\n            which is the process under current law. . . . The\\n            Commissioner of Education will continue to determine\\n            whether or not there is a contested case.\\n\\n            [Sponsors’ Statement to A. 3060 (June 14, 2012).]\\n\\n\\n                                       12\\n Although the TEACHNJ amendments to the TEHL changed the entity that\\n\\nmakes the final determination in a case, it did not make any changes as to what\\n\\ncould or should be the final determination. Arbitrators have the same\\n\\ndiscretion to impose penalties under the post-TEACHNJ version of the TEHL\\n\\nas did the hearing officer under the pre-amendment version of the statute.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      This Court reviews decisions on motions to vacate an arbitration award\\n\\nde novo. See Yarborough v. State-Operated Sch. Dist. of Newark, \\n455 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 136\\n, 139 (App. Div. 2018). However, in reviewing a motion to vacate\\n\\nan arbitration decision, as is the case here, we must be mindful of New\\n\\nJersey’s “strong preference for judicial confirmation of arbitration awards .”\\n\\nMiddletown Twp. PBA Loc. 124 v. Township of Middletown, \\n193 N.J. 1\\n, 10\\n\\n(2007) (quoting N.J. Tpk. Auth. v. Loc. 196, IFPTE, \\n190 N.J. 283\\n, 292\\n\\n(2007)).\\n\\n      In this appeal, our review is further circumscribed by the TEHL’s\\n\\nspecific provisions stating that an “arbitrator’s determination shall be final and\\n\\nbinding and may not be appealable to the [C]ommissioner or the State Board\\n\\nof Education. The determination shall be subject to judicial review and\\n\\nenforcement as provided pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:24-7 through N.J.S.A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        13\\n 2A:24-10.” N.J.S.A. 18A:6-17.1(e). Under the referenced statutes, a court\\n\\n“shall vacate” an arbitrator’s award:\\n\\n            a. Where the award was procured by corruption, fraud\\n            or undue means;\\n\\n            b. Where there was either evident partiality or\\n            corruption in the arbitrators, or any thereof;\\n\\n            c. Where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in\\n            refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause\\n            being shown therefor, or in refusing to hear evidence,\\n            pertinent and material to the controversy, or of any\\n            other misbehaviors prejudicial to the rights of any\\n            party;\\n\\n            d. Where the arbitrators exceeded or so imperfectly\\n            executed their powers that a mutual, final and definite\\n            award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 2A:24-8.]\\n\\n      “‘[L]imits to the arbitrator’s authority . . . are defined by statute,\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2A:24-8,’ as well as ‘by the questions framed by the parties in a\\n\\nparticular dispute.’” Bound Brook Bd. of Educ. v. Ciripompa, \\n228 N.J. 4\\n, 12\\n\\n(2017) (alteration and omission in original) (quoting Loc. No. 153, Off. & Pro.\\n\\nEmps. Int’l Union, AFL-CIO v. Tr. Co. of N.J., \\n105 N.J. 442\\n, 449 (1987)).\\n\\n      In deciding whether the arbitrator here exceeded his authority or\\n\\nimperfectly executed his power, as Sanjuan alleges, we must review whether\\n\\nthe “arbitrator’s award ‘[was] consonant with the matter submitted.\\n\\nOtherwise, the determination is contrary to the authority vested in him.’” Ibid.\\n                                         14\\n (quoting Grover v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., \\n80 N.J. 221\\n, 231 (1979)).\\n\\n“This particular claim of error implicates subsection (d) of N.J.S.A. 2A:24-8.”1\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n                                         IV.\\n\\n        We apply the above principles to the present appeal to determine\\n\\nwhether N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 constrains the arbitrator to consider only the\\n\\npenalties of “dismissal or reduction in salary of the person charged.” If so, the\\n\\narbitrator here exceeded his authority by imposing a demotion instead of\\n\\ntermination, and the award is subject to vacatur under N.J.S.A. 2A:24-8.\\n\\n        We first reiterate that the statute imposes a condition on the\\n\\nCommissioner -- namely that if the Commissioner finds that the charges are\\n\\n“sufficient to warrant dismissal or reduction in salary,” then the Commissioner\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Sanjuan does not specifically state under which subsection of N.J.S.A.\\n2A:24-8 she challenges the arbitrator’s award. She alleges “[n]either counsel\\never suggested to the arbitrator that he had the authority to demote [her] nor\\nthat he could remove her tenure as an [a]dministrator and allow her to retain\\nher tenure as a [t]eacher.” The trial court discussed a challenge under N.J.S.A.\\n2A:24-8(a), which provides that an award may be vacated “[w]here the award\\nwas procured by corruption, fraud or undue means.” “‘[U]ndue means’\\nordinarily encompasses a situation in which the arbitrator has made an\\nacknowledged mistake of fact or law or a mistake that is apparent on the face\\nof the record.” Borough of E. Rutherford v. E. Rutherford PBA Loc. 275, \\n213\\nN.J. 190\\n, 203 (2013) (alteration in original) (quoting Off. of Emp. Rels. v.\\nCommc’ns. Workers of Am., \\n154 N.J. 98\\n, 111 (1998)). Although N.J.S.A.\\n2A:24-8(a) may be related to the present inquiry, we instead construe\\nSanjuan’s argument as a challenge pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:24-8(d).\\n                                         15\\n “shall refer the case to an arbitrator.” That construction sets forth the\\n\\nconditions under which a matter must be referred to arbitration by the\\n\\nCommissioner; it does not set forth, limit, or in any way address the penalties\\n\\nthat may be imposed by an arbitrator to whom a matter is referred.\\n\\n      If the Legislature had wanted to limit the possible penalties that a\\n\\ntenured employee could face under the amended statute, it could have done so.\\n\\nInstead, the Legislature included in the TEHL only the conditional “if x, then\\n\\ny” jurisdictional trigger of N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 that informs the Commissioner\\n\\nwhen a case must be submitted to binding arbitration. Although the legislation\\n\\nlimits the cases that reach the arbitrator, it does not limit the remedies\\n\\navailable to the arbitrator. And that remains the case even after the 2012\\n\\nTEACHNJ amendments to the TEHL, under which the arbitrator’s discretion\\n\\nwas not circumscribed despite the change in the person to whom the contested\\n\\ncharge is submitted. See N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16; Sponsors’ Statement to A. 3060.\\n\\n      Cases applying the TEHL have accordingly recognized the broad\\n\\ndiscretion of hearing officers and arbitrators to fashion an appropriate remedy\\n\\nwhen imposing a penalty for tenure charges. We note that cases decided\\n\\nbefore the TEACHNJ amendments to the TEHL are as pertinent to our analysis\\n\\nas post-amendment cases because the relevant statutory language did not\\n\\nchange.\\n\\n\\n                                         16\\n       In County College of Morris Staff Ass’n v. County College of Morris,\\n\\nwe “assumed” that if the arbitrator in that case had concluded that the charged\\n\\noffenses did “not rise to a level of misconduct that constitute[d] just cause for\\n\\ndischarge[,] . . . the proper remedy would have been a disciplinary penalty less\\n\\nsevere than that of discharge.” \\n100 N.J. 383\\n, 393-94 (1985) (emphasis added).\\n\\nThat case -- unlike the case before us -- was governed by the terms of a\\n\\ncontract between the college and its staff; the contract included a “provision\\n\\nthat prohibited [the arbitrator] from adding to, altering, or modifying the\\n\\nparties’ agreement.” Id. at 385-86, 393. For that reason, we concluded that\\n\\nthe arbitrator exceeded his authority in deviating from the contract when, upon\\n\\nfinding just cause for discharge, he nevertheless imposed a lesser penalty. Id.\\n\\nat 393-94, 397. We clarified that the arbitrator’s authority to impose a lesser\\n\\npenalty was circumscribed both by his finding of just cause and by the\\n\\ncontractual terms mandating discharge upon that finding, but we stressed “that\\n\\nthe option of imposing some lesser penalty was available under appropriate\\n\\ncircumstances,” regardless of the fact “that the parties’ contract did not\\n\\nprovide specifically for discipline short of discharge.” Ibid.\\n\\n      In County College, we thus recognized the broad discretion of arbitrators\\n\\nin deciding remedies in the absence of limiting contractual provisions. Id. at\\n\\n398. We similarly acknowledged that discretion in Linden, in which we\\n\\n\\n                                        17\\n reinstated an arbitral imposition of unpaid suspension rather than termination\\n\\nbecause neither the terms of the parties’ collective negotiating agreement nor\\n\\nthe questions posed to the arbitrator “limited the power of the arbitrator” to\\n\\ndecide what remedy would be appropriate if he did not find just cause to\\n\\nterminate. 202 N.J. at 270-71, 277, 283. As did County College, Linden\\n\\ninvolved an agreement between the parties -- absent here -- that could limit an\\n\\narbitrator’s discretion. Id. at 272. And we again noted that, in the absence of\\n\\nsuch a contractual limitation, the arbitrator had broad discretion to fashion the\\n\\nappropriate remedy. Id. at 281.\\n\\n      That discretion is evident as well in cases that did not reach the courts\\n\\nafter final decisions by the Commissioner. For example, the administrative\\n\\nproceedings in In re Tenure Hearing of McCormick are informative. In\\n\\nMcCormick, the Hunterdon Board of Education filed tenure charges against\\n\\nPaul McCormick, an English teacher, seeking his demotion for failure to\\n\\nperform assigned cafeteria duties and insubordination. See EDU 166-6/78, 1\\n\\nNew Jersey School Law Decisions 1980 149-50 (initial decision, Jan. 14,\\n\\n1980). Finding the charges to be true, the ALJ decided that McCormick\\n\\nshould “forfeit his tenure as Department Chairman, or Supervisor” but “retain\\n\\ntenure and all seniority as a teaching staff member.” Id. at 153. The\\n\\nCommissioner affirmed the ALJ’s findings and adopted them, concluding that\\n\\n\\n                                        18\\n the ALJ properly determined that “a penalty tailored to meet the circumstances\\n\\nof [the] case” was warranted. Id. at 155 (final decision, Mar. 3, 1980). Thus,\\n\\nthe Commissioner in McCormick recognized that the adjudicator had wide\\n\\ndiscretion to fashion appropriate remedies.\\n\\n      In this case, the arbitrator similarly found that Sanjuan’s conduct did not\\n\\nwarrant her termination and instead only “justified a penalty less severe than”\\n\\ndismissal; he imposed precisely such a penalty. County College is\\n\\ndistinguishable because the arbitrator in that case found just cause for\\n\\ndischarge but chose to impose a lesser penalty, contrary to the terms of the\\n\\nparties’ agreement. Although Linden likewise featured a contractual\\n\\nagreement not present here, it nevertheless supports the proposition that when\\n\\nan arbitrator does not find “just cause” for termination and is not limited by an\\n\\nagreement forged between the parties, the arbitrator has latitude to fashion an\\n\\nappropriate remedy -- such as termination of an administrative position\\n\\nwithout backpay. 202 N.J. at 270-71.\\n\\n      Because N.J.S.A. 18A:6-16 does not limit the possible penalties to\\n\\nreduction in salary and termination and no contractual agreement sets limits\\n\\nbeyond those imposed by the TEHL, and in keeping with the broad discretion\\n\\nto fashion remedies long recognized in decisional law, we find that the\\n\\narbitrator here did not exceed his powers in demoting Sanjuan and instead\\n\\n\\n                                       19\\n correctly determined a penalty tailored to this case. We therefore reverse the\\n\\ndecision of the Appellate Division and remand for reinstatement of the\\n\\narbitrator’s award demoting Sanjuan. In light of our holding, we need not\\n\\nconsider whether the arbitrator would be estopped from reconsidering his\\n\\ndecision about termination if that were the only available remedy.\\n\\n                                        V.\\n\\n      For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the Appellate Division\\n\\nis reversed and the arbitrator’s award is reinstated.\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, PIERRE-\\nLOUIS, WAINER APTER, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE SOLOMON’s\\nopinion.

B.P.\\n                              (A-56-22) (087676)\\n\\nArgued January 4, 2024 -- Decided May 21, 2024\\n\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n      In this appeal, the Court considers whether the New Jersey Division of Child\\nProtection and Permanency (Division) met its burden of establishing by a\\npreponderance of the evidence that a mother abused or neglected her newborn child.\\n\\n      After B.P. (Beth) gave birth to M.S. (Mia) in June 2020, the hospital\\ncontacted the Division because both mother and child tested positive for marijuana.\\nBeth expressed to the Division caseworker that she would cooperate with the\\nDivision and engage in the offered services. Beth was discharged from the hospital\\ntwo days after delivering, but Mia remained in the hospital. Beth never returned to\\nthe hospital, and the Division was unable to contact or locate her because Beth\\nprovided the Division with incorrect contact information. Mia stayed in the hospital\\ntwo days longer than she would have if Beth returned to take custody of her.\\nHospital workers clothed, fed, and cared for Mia. The Division caseworker testified\\nthat Mia was healthy and her needs were met during that time.\\n\\n       The Division took custody of Mia and placed her in a resource home. The\\nDivision filed an action against Beth, arguing that she abused and neglected Mia\\nbecause she failed to exercise a minimum degree of care in supplying Mia with food,\\nclothing, and shelter pursuant to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a). Beth appeared for the\\nproceedings, and the trial court concluded that the Division met its burden in\\nproving that Beth abused and neglected Mia. The Appellate Division affirmed.\\n\\n      The Court granted certification. 254 N.J. 512 (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Although Beth left the hospital and did not return, Beth left Mia in a\\nhospital where she was undoubtedly well taken care of and her needs were met.\\nNothing in the facts suggest that Beth’s actions impaired Mia or put Mia in\\nimminent danger of being impaired while she remained in the safety of the hospital’s\\ncare. The Division therefore failed to meet its burden of establishing abuse or\\nneglect pursuant to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a).\\n                                          1\\n 1. Title Nine governs acts of abuse and neglect against a child. Its paramount\\nconcern is the safety of the children and not the culpability of parental conduct. The\\nDivision has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a parent\\nabused or neglected a child, and strict adherence to the statutory standards of\\nN.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4) is important. (pp. 16-17)\\n\\n2. To substantiate an abuse or neglect finding under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a), as\\nrelevant here, the Division must prove that a child’s “physical, mental, or emotional\\ncondition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired” due to\\nthe parent’s failure to “exercise a minimum degree of care . . . in supplying the child\\nwith adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medical or surgical care.” Absent\\nproof of the child’s actual impairment, the critical focus is on evidence of imminent\\ndanger or substantial risk of harm. “Imminent” means threatening to occur\\nimmediately, dangerously impending, or about to take place. Whether the parent\\nfailed to exercise a minimum degree of care means that a parent’s conduct must be\\ngrossly negligent or reckless when analyzed in light of the dangers and risks\\nassociated with the situation. (pp. 17-21)\\n\\n3. The facts here do not provide a sufficient basis for a finding that Beth abused or\\nneglected Mia within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a) by putting her in\\nimminent danger of being impaired due to lack of food, clothing, shelter, or medical\\ncare. Beth left Mia at a hospital -- one of the safest places for a newborn child to be.\\nThere is no question that Mia would be (and was) provided with food, clothing,\\nshelter, and medical care if needed while in the hospital. Beth’s conduct of leaving\\nMia at the hospital was not grossly negligent or reckless. (pp. 21-23)\\n\\n4. The Division argues that Beth placed Mia in imminent danger of being impaired\\nbecause if Mia needed medical care for which a parent’s permission was necessary,\\nBeth would not have been able to be located. But N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a) requires\\na finding that the child’s “condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of\\nbecoming impaired.” (emphases added). And it is unlikely that the Legislature\\nwould have chosen the word “imminent” to describe an outside possibility of a child\\nbecoming impaired. Further, it is highly implausible that in an emergency, the\\nhospital would not provide necessary care to a child. Mia was well cared for and all\\nher needs were met in the hospital. The Court does not reach the arguments\\nregarding the Safe Haven Infant Protection Act in light of its holding that the\\nDivision failed to meet its burden of proving abuse or neglect.

After B.P. (Beth) gave birth to M.S. (Mia), the hospital\\n\\n                                      2\\n contacted the Division because both mother and child tested positive for\\n\\nmarijuana. 1 Beth expressed to the Division caseworker that she would\\n\\ncooperate with the Division and engage in the offered services. Beth was\\n\\ndischarged from the hospital two days after delivering, but Mia remained in\\n\\nthe hospital. Beth never returned to the hospital, and the Division was unable\\n\\nto contact or locate her because Beth provided the Division with incorrect\\n\\nphone numbers and a nonexistent home address.\\n\\n      The Division took custody of Mia and placed her in a resource home.\\n\\nThe Division subsequently filed an abuse or neglect action against Beth\\n\\narguing that Beth abused and neglected Mia because she failed to exercise a\\n\\nminimum degree of care in supplying Mia with food, clothing, and shelter\\n\\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4). Beth appeared for the proceedings and\\n\\nargued that the Division did not establish the elements required for an abuse or\\n\\nneglect finding. The trial court concluded that the Division met its burden in\\n\\nproving that Beth abused and neglected Mia. The Appellate Division affirmed.\\n\\n      We now reverse. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a), in order to\\n\\nsubstantiate an abuse or neglect finding, the Division must prove that a child’s\\n\\n“physical, mental, or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent\\n\\n\\n1\\n  In accordance with Rule 1:38-3(d)(12), and to protect the privacy of the\\nfamily at issue in this appeal, we refer to the individuals involved by initials\\nand pseudonyms.\\n                                         3\\n danger of becoming impaired” due to the parent’s failure to “exercise a\\n\\nminimum degree of care . . . in supplying the child with adequate food,\\n\\nclothing, shelter, education, medical or surgical care.” Although Beth left the\\n\\nhospital and did not return, Beth left Mia in a hospital where she was\\n\\nundoubtedly well taken care of and her needs were met. Nothing in the facts\\n\\nsuggest that Beth’s actions impaired Mia or put Mia in imminent danger of\\n\\nbeing impaired while she remained in the safety of the hospital’s care.\\n\\n                                       I.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Beth gave birth to Mia at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center on June 21,\\n\\n2020. The next day, the hospital referred Beth and Mia to the Division after\\n\\nthey both tested positive for marijuana. In an interview with a hospital social\\n\\nworker conducted shortly after Mia’s birth, Beth discussed her plan for Mia’s\\n\\npediatric care and professed to have the essentials to care for Mia, including\\n\\nappropriate living arrangements and familial support. The social worker\\n\\ninformed Beth about the positive marijuana tests, the referral to the Division,\\n\\nand that Mia would be held at the hospital pending the Division’s\\n\\ninvestigation.\\n\\n      On June 22, 2020, the Division sent a caseworker to investigate the\\n\\nhospital’s referral and interview Beth. Beth told the caseworker her name had\\n\\n                                        4\\n the initials B.A. -- the same name that appeared on Mia’s birth records -- but\\n\\nthe Division later learned that the name Beth had provided was not her real\\n\\nname, and that Beth’s real initials were B.P. Beth also informed the\\n\\ncaseworker that Mia’s father’s name was K.S., but the Division later\\n\\ndiscovered that although his middle and last initials are K.S., his full name had\\n\\nthe initials L.K.S. (Leo). Beth explained that she had a “complicated”\\n\\nrelationship with Leo and that they did not live together, but she expected that\\n\\nhe would financially provide for her and Mia.\\n\\n      During the interview, Beth admitted to smoking marijuana two weeks\\n\\nbefore delivering Mia to help with her lack of appetite. She informed the\\n\\ncaseworker that she lived with her grandmother M.J. (Martha) at 84 Norwood\\n\\nAvenue in Irvington and was currently unemployed because she had been laid\\n\\noff from her position as a daycare assistant at the start of the COVID-19\\n\\npandemic. Beth reported receiving $300 monthly in food stamps and that she\\n\\nhad a pending application to the New Jersey Supplemental Nutrition Program\\n\\nfor Women Infants and Children.\\n\\n      The caseworker informed Beth that a home assessment was required to\\n\\ndetermine whether she could adequately provide and care for Mia. Beth\\n\\nexpressed willingness to cooperate with the Division, and she agreed to receive\\n\\nservices for first-time mothers and substance abuse evaluations from Essex\\n\\n                                        5\\n Pregnancy and Parenting Connection. She also consented to the home\\n\\nassessment and requested that the Division contact her, Martha, and Leo before\\n\\nthe evaluation. She provided the caseworker with all their contact information.\\n\\n      That same day, the Division caseworker observed Beth and Mia together\\n\\nin the hospital’s nursery. The caseworker noted that Beth was attentive and\\n\\ninquisitive, “appeared to be caring properly” for Mia, and that Mia “was safe,\\n\\nhealthy, and well taken care of.”\\n\\n      The following day, June 23, 2020, the Division caseworker attempted to\\n\\ncontact Beth and Martha via the phone numbers Beth provided. Beth’s number\\n\\nwas not in service and the person who answered the phone that purportedly\\n\\nbelonged to Martha told the caseworker she had the wrong number. Further,\\n\\nthe Division learned that Leo had a different number than the one Beth\\n\\nprovided. When the caseworker called Leo’s correct phone number, no one\\n\\nanswered.\\n\\n      Later that day, the caseworker called the hospital to discuss the\\n\\ninvestigation, and a hospital employee handed the phone to Beth. Beth acted\\n\\nconfused and surprised that the numbers she provided were incorrect. Beth\\n\\nadvised the caseworker that she would call her back. Beth called the\\n\\ncaseworker back from a phone number she had not previously provided and\\n\\nagreed to meet the caseworker at her home at 4:00 p.m. that day for the home\\n\\n                                       6\\n assessment. Upon arriving at 84 Norwood Avenue in Irvington, however, the\\n\\ncaseworker found that there was no residence at the address Beth provided,\\n\\nwhich the caseworker confirmed after speaking with nearby residents. To\\n\\nensure she did not mistakenly go to the wrong address, the caseworker also\\n\\ntravelled to 84 Norwood Avenue in Newark, where she found a vacant lot.\\n\\nThe caseworker attempted to call Beth at the number Beth had called from\\n\\nearlier that day, but no one answered.\\n\\n      Beth was discharged from the hospital on June 23, while Mia remained.\\n\\nThe Division lost contact with Beth after June 23. Beth never returned to the\\n\\nhospital to see Mia, nor did she contact the hospital regarding when Mia would\\n\\nbe discharged. On June 26, the Division executed an emergency removal of\\n\\nMia from the hospital and placed her in a non-relative resource home. From\\n\\nJune 23 to June 26, 2020, hospital workers clothed, fed, and cared for Mia.\\n\\nThe caseworker testified that Mia’s needs were met during that time.\\n\\n                                         B.\\n\\n      On June 30, 2020, the Division filed a verified complaint and order to\\n\\nshow cause for temporary custody of Mia against Beth and Leo. Neither\\n\\nparent was present at the order to show cause hearing conducted that same day.\\n\\nThe court granted the Division temporary custody of Mia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         7\\n       The Division subsequently initiated Title Nine proceedings and\\n\\nsubstantiated a claim against Beth for abusing or neglecting Mia under\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(5), which requires a finding of willful abandonment. The\\n\\nDivision concluded that Beth abandoned Mia and lacked an apparent intention\\n\\nto return. 2 The trial court scheduled the fact-finding hearing for November 20,\\n\\n2020. On November 17, however, the Division advised the court and Beth’s\\n\\ncounsel via email that it intended to pursue an abuse or neglect charge against\\n\\nBeth under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4) for failing to exercise a minimum degree of\\n\\ncare for Mia, rather than for abandonment under (c)(5). Beth opposed the\\n\\nDivision’s attempt to change its legal theory, but the court allowed it, finding\\n\\nthere was no meaningful difference between the two provisions given the\\n\\nevidence.\\n\\n      The fact-finding hearing occurred on December 3, 2020. Beth appeared\\n\\nwith counsel, but neither she nor Mia’s Law Guardian proffered any witnesses\\n\\nor evidence. The caseworker assigned to Mia’s case testified for the Division.\\n\\nThe Division also presented evidence of the hospital records and its\\n\\ninvestigative report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n The Division did not investigate Leo or substantiate any claims against him.\\nLeo, though listed as a defendant, is not involved in this appeal.\\n\\n                                        8\\n       During closing arguments, Beth first argued that the Division failed to\\n\\nmeet its burden of proving that she abused or neglected Mia under N.J.S.A.\\n\\n9:6-8.21(c)(4). She contended that “[t]his is not a case of . . . a parent failing\\n\\nto provide for her baby,” but was instead the responsible choice of a desperate\\n\\nyoung mother who left her baby at the hospital where she would receive\\n\\nshelter and care. Second, Beth argued that the New Jersey Safe Haven Infant\\n\\nProtection Act (Safe Haven Act), N.J.S.A. 30:4C-15.5 to -15.11, 3 sheltered her\\n\\nactions from Title Nine liability.\\n\\n      The Division argued that Beth abused and neglected Mia “when she\\n\\nfailed to exercise a minimum degree of care by leaving her newborn child in\\n\\nthe hospital and failing to provide her newborn baby with any provisions.” It\\n\\nfurther argued that the Safe Haven Act was inapplicable because Beth did not\\n\\ninvoke the Act’s protections and instead evinced an intent to return and care\\n\\nfor Mia. Mia’s Law Guardian, supporting the Division, advanced similar\\n\\narguments.\\n\\n\\n3\\n  The Legislature enacted the Safe Haven Act in 2000, L. 2000, c. 58. In\\ndoing so, the Legislature recognized “that newborn infants are sometimes\\nabandoned in life-threatening situations,” and new parents “under severe\\nemotional stress . . . may need a safe haven available to them and their child.”\\nN.J.S.A 30:4C-15.6(a) to (b). The Act grants “[a]nonymity, confidentiality\\nand freedom from prosecution” to parents who comply with its requirements as\\na means of encouraging parents to safely leave an infant at a safe haven\\nlocation, which includes police stations, fire departments, and hospitals. Id. at\\n(c); N.J.S.A 30:4C-15.7(e).\\n                                        9\\n       On December 9, 2020, the trial court issued an oral decision finding that\\n\\nBeth abused or neglected Mia presumably under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a) and\\n\\n(b) by failing to exercise the minimum degree of care in providing Mia with\\n\\n“adequate food, clothing, and shelter” and by failing to provide her with\\n\\n“proper supervision, care, or a plan by unreasonably putting the child at a\\n\\nfurther risk of harm.” The court emphasized that its ruling regarding risk of\\n\\nharm was unrelated to the positive marijuana tests. The court rejected Beth’s\\n\\nargument that Mia was not at risk of harm because she was receiving adequate\\n\\ncare in the hospital, and instead reasoned that Beth unreasonably put Mia at\\n\\nrisk of harm by walking away from her without a plan for her care and lying to\\n\\nthe Division about her intentions to comply with the home assessment process.\\n\\n      In so ruling, the court explained that Beth could have been truthful to the\\n\\nDivision about her intentions and granted it temporary custody of Mia to make\\n\\nimportant medical and legal decisions. The court explained that Beth’s\\n\\npurported desire to care for Mia, coupled with her disappearance, meant that\\n\\nno one was available to make those decisions.\\n\\n      The court also rejected Beth’s argument that the Safe Haven Act\\n\\nsheltered her from prosecution. Relying on the statute’s text, the court\\n\\nexplained that the Safe Haven Act applies only to new parents who do “not\\n\\nexpress an intent to return for the child.” The court reasoned that Beth did not\\n\\n                                       10\\n unambiguously state her desire to relinquish Mia, but instead misled the\\n\\nDivision into believing she desired to care for Mia by agreeing to cooperate\\n\\nwith the home assessment and to receive substance abuse and new mother\\n\\nassistance.\\n\\n      At the conclusion of the proceedings, the parties agreed that Beth, Leo,\\n\\nand Mia’s paternal grandmother would share legal custody of Mia, with the\\n\\npaternal grandmother maintaining physical custody. The trial court sanctioned\\n\\nthis arrangement.\\n\\n      Beth appealed the trial court’s finding of abuse and neglect, and the\\n\\nAppellate Division affirmed. First, the Appellate Division agreed that Beth’s\\n\\n“intentional failure to provide an appropriate plan for [Mia’s] care and\\n\\nsecurity” constituted abuse or neglect under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4). 4 The\\n\\ncourt explained that Beth’s actions of “deliberately” providing the Division\\n\\nfalse information, losing contact, and walking away from Mia cannot\\n\\n“reasonably be classified as inattentive or merely negligent,” but instead\\n\\n“caused real harm to [Mia]” because she “remained in the hospital longer than\\n\\nnecessary.” Second, the Appellate Division concluded that Beth did not\\n\\n\\n4\\n  The Appellate Division’s opinion does not distinguish N.J.S.A. 9:6-\\n8.21(c)(4)(a) from 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(b), nor does it clarify under which of those\\nsubsections -- both found satisfied by the trial court -- it affirmed the abuse or\\nneglect finding.\\n\\n                                        11\\n invoke the Safe Haven Act because she “clearly ‘express[ed] an intent to\\n\\nreturn’ for [Mia].” 5\\n\\n      We granted Beth’s petition for certification. 254 N.J. 512 (2023). We\\n\\nalso granted Legal Services of New Jersey (LSNJ) and the American Civil\\n\\nLiberties Union of New Jersey and Pregnancy Justice (jointly, ACLU) leave to\\n\\nappear as amici curiae.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Beth asks us to reverse the Appellate Division’s decision, arguing that\\n\\nher actions do not constitute abuse or neglect. Beth contends that the\\n\\nDivision’s abuse or neglect theory contradicts N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)’s textual\\n\\nrequirements because the Division failed to adduce evidence that she put Mia’s\\n\\nwell-being at imminent risk of impairment by leaving her safe and cared for at\\n\\nthe hospital. Rather than basing their findings on evidence of actual or\\n\\nimminent impairment, Beth argues, the Division and courts below punished\\n\\nher because she was untruthful to the Division caseworker. Beth also asserts\\n\\nthat the Safe Haven Act shelters her from an abuse or neglect prosecution\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  Beth also argued that the trial court exhibited gender bias against her, which\\nshe argues before this Court as well. The Appellate Division rejected this\\nargument because there is no evidence in the record indicating that the trial\\njudge exhibited any bias. We agree and reject that argument as well.\\n                                        12\\n because she complied with the Act by walking away from Mia and not\\n\\nexpressing an intent to return.\\n\\n      LSNJ supports Beth’s positions. It first urges us to adopt a bright-line\\n\\nrule holding that a court cannot make an abuse or neglect finding under any\\n\\nsection of N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c) when a parent leaves an infant at a safe haven\\n\\nlocation and does not return. Second, LSNJ argues that to properly invoke the\\n\\nSafe Haven Act’s protections, a new parent need not “affirmatively state,\\n\\nverbally, an intention to relinquish their infant,” but must merely leave the\\n\\nchild at a safe haven location and not express or demonstrate an intent to\\n\\nreturn.\\n\\n      The ACLU, jointly with Pregnancy Justice, also urges this Court to\\n\\nreverse the Appellate Division’s decision, arguing that Beth did not abuse Mia\\n\\nunder N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4) because Mia was neither impaired nor in\\n\\nimminent danger of becoming impaired when she remained in the hospital.\\n\\nThe ACLU contends that Beth properly invoked the Safe Haven Act because\\n\\nshe did not express an intent to return for Mia, and any statements indicating\\n\\nher desire to care for Mia comport with the Division’s stance on allowing\\n\\nparents to reunite with their children even after invoking the Safe Haven Act.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       13\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      The Division asks us to affirm the Appellate Division’s decision and\\n\\nargues that Beth abused or neglected Mia under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4) 6 when\\n\\nshe “provided false information and did not return to care for her child.” The\\n\\nDivision contends that Beth’s actions “resulted in Mia remaining hospitalized\\n\\nlonger than necessary, deprived Mia of any parental care or nurture, and\\n\\nultimately required the Division to intervene and place Mia with a non-relative\\n\\nresource home.” According to the Division, those realities demonstrate that\\n\\nBeth placed Mia at a substantial risk of harm because no one was available to\\n\\nmake medical or legal decisions for her, and therefore, Beth’s “intentional\\n\\nfailure to provide an appropriate plan for Mia’s care and security” suffices as\\n\\nabuse or neglect under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4). The Division further maintains\\n\\nthat Beth did not invoke the Safe Haven Act because she “unambiguously did\\n\\nexpress an intent to return and to care for Mia on multiple occasions.”\\n\\n      Finally, Mia’s Law Guardian asks us to affirm, echoing the Division’s\\n\\narguments. The Law Guardian concedes that Mia “did not experience harm\\n\\nbecause of lacking food, shelter or medical care” but nonetheless maintains\\n\\nthat Beth is liable under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4) because her actions kept Mia\\n\\n\\n6\\n  The Division confirmed during oral argument that it relies solely on N.J.S.A.\\n9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a) and not subsection (b), notwithstanding the fact that the trial\\ncourt appeared to find both subsections applied to Beth’s conduct.\\n                                       14\\n “in limbo” and delayed her permanent placement, subjecting her to possible\\n\\nharm.\\n\\n                                         III.\\n\\n                                         A.\\n\\n        Appellate courts defer to a trial court’s factual findings when they are\\n\\n“supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence.” Cesare v. Cesare, 154\\n\\nN.J. 394, 411-12 (1998). “Because of the family courts’ special jurisdiction\\n\\nand expertise in family matters, [we] should accord deference to family court\\n\\nfactfinding.” Id. at 413. Therefore, “[w]e will not overturn a family court’s\\n\\nfactfindings unless they are so ‘wide of the mark’ that our intervention is\\n\\nnecessary to correct an injustice.” DYFS v. F.M., 211 N.J. 420, 448 (2012)\\n\\n(quoting DYFS v. E.P., 196 N.J. 88, 104 (2008)). The family court’s legal\\n\\nconclusions, however, are reviewed de novo. DCPP v. A.B., 231 N.J. 354, 369\\n\\n(2017).\\n\\n        This appeal requires us to interpret N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4), a task of\\n\\nstatutory interpretation that we conduct de novo, without according deference\\n\\nto the trial court’s analysis. Kocanowski v. Township of Bridgewater, 237\\n\\nN.J. 3, 9 (2019). Our role when interpreting a statute “is to determine and give\\n\\neffect to the Legislature’s intent.” DYFS v. A.L., 213 N.J. 1, 20 (2013).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         15\\n       To achieve that goal, “we look first to the plain language of the statute,”\\n\\nibid., attributing to statutory words “their ordinary meaning and significance\\n\\nand read[ing] them in context with related provisions so as to give sense to the\\n\\nlegislation as a whole,” DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005)\\n\\n(citations omitted). If the statutory text has a clear meaning, that meaning\\n\\ncontrols, but if the plain language is ambiguous or leads “to an absurd result or\\n\\nto a result at odds with the objective of the overall legislative scheme,” then\\n\\nwe will analyze extrinsic sources such as legislative history to best determine\\n\\nlegislative intent. DCPP v. Y.N., 220 N.J. 165, 178 (2014).\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      Title Nine “governs acts of abuse and neglect against a child.” A.L., 213\\n\\nN.J. at 18. Its purpose is “to protect children ‘who have had serious injury\\n\\ninflicted upon them’ and make sure they are ‘immediately safeguarded from\\n\\nfurther injury and possible death.’” Ibid. (quoting N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.8(a)). Thus,\\n\\nTitle Nine’s “‘paramount concern’ is the ‘safety of the children’ and ‘not the\\n\\nculpability of parental conduct.’” Ibid. (first quoting N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.8(a); and\\n\\nthen quoting G.S. v. DYFS, 157 N.J. 161, 177 (1999)).\\n\\n      In Title Nine proceedings, the Division has the burden of proving by a\\n\\npreponderance of competent, material, and relevant evidence that a parent\\n\\nabused or neglected a child. N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.46(b); DCPP v. J.R.-R., 248 N.J.\\n\\n                                       16\\n 353, 376 (2021). An abuse or neglect adjudication has serious consequences\\n\\nfor a parent as it may serve as the basis for terminating parental rights, Y.N.,\\n\\n220 N.J. at 179, and the parent’s name is placed on the child abuse registry,\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 9:6-8.11. Employers may access the registry while fulfilling their\\n\\nlegal obligation to “consider child abuse or neglect information when\\n\\nconducting a background check or employment-related screening.” A.L., 213\\n\\nN.J. at 26. Therefore, “because the stakes are high for all parties concerned,”\\n\\nwe have emphasized that “[s]trict adherence to the statutory standards of\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4) is important.” Y.N., 220 N.J. at 179; see also A.L.,\\n\\n213 N.J. at 34.\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4) provides that an “abused or neglected child” is\\n\\n            a child whose physical, mental, or emotional condition\\n            has been impaired or is in imminent danger of\\n            becoming impaired as the result of the failure of his\\n            parent or guardian, as herein defined, to exercise a\\n            minimum degree of care (a) in supplying the child with\\n            adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medical or\\n            surgical care though financially able to do so or though\\n            offered financial or other reasonable means to do so, or\\n            (b) in providing the child with proper supervision or\\n            guardianship, by unreasonably inflicting or allowing to\\n            be inflicted harm, or substantial risk thereof, including\\n            the infliction of excessive corporal punishment; or by\\n            any other acts of a similarly serious nature requiring the\\n            aid of the court.\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\n                                        17\\n To sustain an abuse or neglect finding under either subsection (a) or (b), the\\n\\nDivision must establish (1) that a child’s “physical, mental, or emotional\\n\\ncondition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired,”\\n\\nibid. (emphasis added), and (2) the “impairment or imminent impairment\\n\\nresults from the parent’s failure to exercise a minimum degree of care,” A.B.,\\n\\n231 N.J. at 369 (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Evidence of the child’s actual impairment or harm satisfies the first\\n\\nelement. A.L., 213 N.J. at 22. Absent proof of actual impairment, “the critical\\n\\nfocus is on evidence of imminent danger or substantial risk of harm.” Ibid. In\\n\\nA.L., for example, we held that a child was neither impaired nor at imminent\\n\\nrisk of impairment by virtue of testing positive for cocaine at birth because the\\n\\nchild’s “health was otherwise normal,” and the child was discharged two days\\n\\nafter being born. Id. at 9, 27-30.\\n\\n      We did not, however, define the standard for determining when a child’s\\n\\nwell-being is in “imminent danger” of impairment or harm. Per their plain\\n\\nmeanings, “imminent” means “threatening to occur immediately; dangerously\\n\\nimpending . . . [or] about to take place,” Black’s Law Dictionary 898 (11th ed.\\n\\n2019), and “danger” means “peril; exposure to harm, loss, pain, or other\\n\\nnegative result,” id. at 493. Further, Black’s Law Dictionary defines\\n\\n\\n                                       18\\n “imminently dangerous” as “reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril.”\\n\\nId. at 494.\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)’s second element, whether the parent failed to\\n\\nexercise a minimum degree of care, “means that a parent’s conduct must be\\n\\n‘grossly negligent or reckless’” -- ordinary negligence is insufficient. Y.N.,\\n\\n220 N.J. at 180 (emphasis added) (quoting DCPP v. T.B., 207 N.J. 294, 306\\n\\n(2011)). A parent’s conduct “must ‘be analyzed in light of the dangers and\\n\\nrisks associated with the situation.’” Id. at 184 (quoting G.S., 157 N.J. at 181-\\n\\n82). That inquiry requires us to “account for the surrounding circumstances”\\n\\nbecause “[a]buse and neglect cases ‘are fact-sensitive.’” A.B., 231 N.J. at\\n\\n369-70 (quoting DCPP v. E.D.-O., 223 N.J. 166, 180 (2015)). Weighing\\n\\nwhether a parent has exercised minimum care requires “consideration of the\\n\\nreasonableness of the parent’s conduct.” Y.N., 220 N.J. at 181.\\n\\n      In this matter, the Division relies exclusively on subsection (a) of\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4) to substantiate its abuse or neglect finding.\\n\\n      As noted, subsection (a) requires the Division to prove by a\\n\\npreponderance of evidence that a child was impaired or in imminent danger of\\n\\nbeing impaired by a parent’s failure to exercise minimum care “in supplying\\n\\nthe child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medical or surgical\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       19\\n care though financially able to do so or though offered financial or other\\n\\nreasonable means to do so.” N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a).\\n\\n      Applying those elements in A.B., we affirmed an abuse or neglect\\n\\nadjudication under subsection (a) when a mother, A.B., barred her sixteen-\\n\\nyear-old daughter and her daughter’s infant child from the family home,\\n\\nrelegating them to a home without electricity. 231 N.J. at 358-59. We deemed\\n\\nA.B.’s actions “grossly negligent because she was clearly aware of the\\n\\ndangers” her teenage daughter faced, and because she was not providing her\\n\\ndaughter with “any parental supervision, guidance, or care.” Id. at 370. We\\n\\nagreed with the Appellate Division’s conclusion that “the risks inherent in\\n\\nbarring a sixteen-year-old child from the family home without arranging any\\n\\nalternative source of shelter or support are obvious.” Id. at 371.\\n\\n      Conversely, the Appellate Division reversed an abuse or neglect finding\\n\\nunder subsection (a) in DCPP v. L.W. based on an impoverished mother\\n\\nbringing her children to the Division and consenting to placing them in foster\\n\\ncare because she could not find housing despite her best efforts. 435 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 189, 191-92 (App. Div. 2014). The trial judge had concluded that the\\n\\nmother neglected “her children due to her ‘unbelievably poor planning.’” Id.\\n\\nat 193. In reversing, the Appellate Division reasoned that the mother acted\\n\\ncommendably by turning to the Division rather than subjecting her children to\\n\\n                                       20\\n homelessness. Id. at 196-97. The appellate court noted that “[i]t is important\\n\\nthat impoverished, homeless parents feel free to call on the Division in times\\n\\nof need, without fear of being found neglectful for ‘poor planning.’” Id. at\\n\\n196.\\n\\n                                       IV.\\n\\n       With that guidance in mind, we turn to the facts of this case. There is no\\n\\ndispute that Beth, just days after giving birth, left her daughter Mia, who was\\n\\nnot yet discharged, at the hospital and did not return. Neither the hospital nor\\n\\nthe Division was able to contact or locate Beth thereafter. Mia stayed in the\\n\\nhospital two days longer than she would have if Beth had returned to take\\n\\ncustody of her. While at the hospital, Mia’s needs, including food, clothing,\\n\\nand shelter, were met. Despite testing positive for marijuana at birth, Mia was\\n\\na healthy child; she did not experience any withdrawal symptoms, and she did\\n\\nnot need any emergency medical care while in the hospital prior to the\\n\\nDivision taking custody of her and placing her in a resource home.\\n\\n       The Division sought an abuse or neglect finding against Beth pursuant to\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a), which requires the Division to establish by a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence that a child was impaired or in imminent danger\\n\\nof being impaired by a parent’s failure to exercise minimum care “in supplying\\n\\nthe child with adequate food, clothing, shelter” or medical care. The Division\\n\\n                                       21\\n argues that Beth did not put a plan in place for caring for Mia and “recklessly\\n\\nfailed or refused to supply Mia with adequate food, clothing, and shelter under\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a).”\\n\\n      We cannot find that the Division met its burden under the statute. We\\n\\naccept and defer to the facts found by the trial court in this matter. Those\\n\\nfacts, however, when applied to a plain reading of N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a),\\n\\ndo not provide a sufficient basis for a finding that Beth abused or neglected\\n\\nMia by putting her in imminent danger of being impaired due to lack of food,\\n\\nclothing, shelter, or medical care. Beth did not carelessly leave Mia alone on a\\n\\nstreet corner or in an alleyway without food or shelter, putting her at risk. Beth\\n\\nleft Mia at a hospital -- one of the safest places for a newborn child to be.\\n\\nThere is no question that Mia would be (and was) provided with food,\\n\\nclothing, shelter, and medical care if needed while in the hospital. It is\\n\\nundisputed that Beth provided the Division with incorrect contact information\\n\\nand failed to return to take custody of her child, but those facts are insufficient\\n\\nto substantiate an abuse and neglect finding.\\n\\n      Beth left Mia in a place where she knew the child would be cared for and\\n\\nnot in a place of imminent danger or peril to Mia’s well-being. As we stated in\\n\\nY.N., a parent’s conduct “must ‘be analyzed in light of the dangers and risks\\n\\nassociated with the situation.’” 220 N.J. at 184 (quoting G.S., 157 N.J. at 181-\\n\\n                                        22\\n 82). In considering the facts of this case and determining whether Beth\\n\\nexercised minimum care to ensure that Mia would be cared for, Beth’s conduct\\n\\nof leaving Mia at the hospital was not “grossly negligent or reckless.” See id.\\n\\nat 181.\\n\\n      The Division nevertheless maintains that Beth placed Mia in imminent\\n\\ndanger of being impaired because if Mia needed medical care for which a\\n\\nparent’s permission was necessary, the hospital and the Division would not\\n\\nhave been able to locate Beth to obtain such parental permission. At oral\\n\\nargument, the Division argued at length about the various emergency situations\\n\\nin which a child could be in imminent danger while at a hospital and parental\\n\\npermission would be necessary for the hospital to address the emergency.\\n\\n      But N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a) requires a finding that as a result of the\\n\\nparent’s failure to exercise a minimum degree of care, the child’s “physical,\\n\\nmental, or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of\\n\\nbecoming impaired.” (emphases added). The statute does not state that the\\n\\nmere possibility of the child being impaired is sufficient. Once again, the\\n\\nword imminent means “threatening to occur immediately; dangerously\\n\\nimpending . . . [or] about to take place.” Black’s Law Dictionary 898 (11th ed.\\n\\n2019). It is unlikely that the Legislature would have chosen the word\\n\\n“imminent” to describe an outside possibility of a child becoming impaired or\\n\\n                                       23\\n the infinite number of scenarios that could transpire. Nothing in the plain\\n\\nreading of the statute suggests that any number of hypotheticals in the\\n\\ncircumstance here would suffice to establish that a parent placed a child in\\n\\nimminent danger of impairment. 7\\n\\n      Furthermore, it is highly implausible that in an emergency or life-\\n\\nthreatening situation, the medical staff at a hospital would not provide\\n\\nnecessary care to a child already at the hospital but instead attempt to find the\\n\\nparent that had absconded in order to get permission to administer care. In any\\n\\nevent, Mia was never in need of such medical care. The Division caseworker\\n\\neven testified that Mia was “healthy, and well taken care of.” Although Mia\\n\\ncould have potentially needed medical care during that time, the reality is that\\n\\nshe did not need such care, so the Division’s theory that Mia was in imminent\\n\\nor impending danger of being impaired simply based on a possibility that\\n\\n\\n7\\n  In its oral opinion, the trial court correctly stated that “in the absence of\\nactual harm, a finding of abuse and neglect can be . . . based on proof of\\nimminent danger and substantial risk of harm.” In finding that Beth had\\nabused or neglected Mia, the trial court noted that “[b]y providing . . . false\\ninformation and not returning for the child, [Beth] failed to exercise the\\nminimum degree of care in supplying the child with . . . adequate food,\\nclothing, and shelter.” The court, however, never specifically stated the facts\\nthat supported its finding that Mia was in imminent danger of becoming\\nimpaired as a result of Beth’s failure to exercise a minimum degree of care, as\\nrequired by the statute. If a court substantiates an abuse or neglect finding\\nbased on a parent placing a child in imminent danger of being impaired, the\\ncourt must make the specific findings of the facts underpinning that\\ndetermination.\\n                                          24\\n something, anything, could have happened is an insufficient basis to\\n\\nsubstantiate a finding of abuse or neglect.\\n\\n      The Division further argues that Mia was in danger of impairment\\n\\nbecause she was deprived of parental nurturing and care and because she\\n\\nstayed in the hospital two days later than she otherwise would have. While\\n\\nthese facts might not present an ideal scenario for a newborn child, they do not\\n\\nprove that Mia was abused or neglected as defined in the statute. Mia was well\\n\\ncared for and all her needs were met in the hospital.\\n\\n      Although the parties argued at length regarding the applicability of the\\n\\nSafe Haven Act, we see no reason to reach those arguments because we hold\\n\\nthat the Division failed to meet its burden of establishing abuse or neglect\\n\\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.21(c)(4)(a).\\n\\n                                          V.\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Appellate Division is\\n\\nreversed and the trial court’s finding of abuse and neglect is vacated.\\n\\n\\n\\n    CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nWAINER APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE PIERRE-\\nLOUIS’s opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          25\\n '),\n",

It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n   Viktoriya Usachenok v. State of New Jersey, Department of the Treasury\\n                             (A-40-22) (086861)\\n\\nArgued January 3, 2024 -- Decided May 6, 2024\\n\\nRABNER, C.J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court considers the constitutionality of a regulation that\\napplies to harassment and discrimination investigations in State workplaces. Part of\\nthe regulation requires State investigators to “request” that anyone interviewed “not\\ndiscuss any aspect of the investigation with others.” N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j).\\n\\n       In May 2016, plaintiff Viktoriya Usachenok filed an internal complaint with\\nthe Department of Treasury claiming that her supervisor sexually harassed her and\\nsubjected her to a hostile work environment. Consistent with the text of N.J.A.C.\\n4A:7-3.1(j) at the time, the EEO/AA investigator directed Usachenok not to discuss\\nthe investigation with others and had her sign a form to acknowledge that directive.\\nAfter Usachenok asked her husband, an attorney, about whether to sign a particular\\ndocument related to the investigation, the investigator accused Usachenok of\\nviolating the confidentiality directive and threatened she could be fired. Usachenok\\nfiled a complaint that, among other claims, challenged the confidentiality directive.\\n\\n       The version of N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j) then in effect included the following\\nlanguage: “All persons interviewed, including witnesses, shall be directed not to\\ndiscuss any aspect of the investigation with others in light of the important privacy\\ninterests of all concerned. Failure to comply with this confidentiality directive may\\nresult in administrative and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination.”\\n\\n       While this appeal was pending in the Appellate Division, the Civil Service\\nCommission amended the regulation. The relevant portion of N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j)\\nnow provides that “the EEO/AA Officer/investigator shall request that all persons\\ninterviewed, including witnesses, not discuss any aspect of the investigation with\\nothers, unless there is a legitimate business reason to disclose such information.”\\n\\n      The Appellate Division rejected Usachenok’s constitutional challenge to the\\ncurrent regulation, focusing on the change from a directive to a permissive “request”\\nthrough the amendment. The Court granted certification. \\n253 N.J. 579\\n (2023).\\n                                          1\\n HELD: The State Constitution guarantees an affirmative right to speak freely. N.J.\\nConst. art. I, ¶ 6. The guarantee extends to victims of harassment and discrimination\\nwho have a right to speak out about what happened to them. Although N.J.A.C.\\n4A:7-3.1(j) seeks to advance legitimate interests -- “to protect the integrity of the\\ninvestigation, minimize the risk of retaliation . . . , and protect the important privacy\\ninterests of all concerned” -- it reaches too far in trying to achieve those aims and\\nchills constitutionally protected speech. The rule is overbroad under the State\\nConstitution, and the Court strikes the relevant part of the regulation.\\n\\n1. New Jersey’s Constitution provides broader protection for free expression than\\nthe Federal Constitution and practically all others in the nation. (pp. 12-13)\\n\\n2. The overbreadth doctrine considers the extent of a law’s deterrent effect on\\nlegitimate expression. A law is facially invalid on overbreadth grounds if the statute\\nprohibits a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its plainly legitimate\\nsweep. The United States Supreme Court’s application of the overbreadth doctrine\\nin United States v. Stevens illustrates the principle. The Court found that the statute\\nchallenged in that case created an offense “of alarming breadth” because, although it\\npurported to criminalize animal cruelty, the statute did not actually require “that the\\ndepicted conduct be cruel,” such that hunting periodicals could run afoul of the law.\\n559 U.S. 460\\n, 474-76 (2010). The Court explained that it “would not uphold an\\nunconstitutional statute based on the Government’s representation that it would use\\nthe statute “to reach only ‘extreme’ cruelty,” and that it could not rewrite the statute\\n“to conform it to constitutional requirements.” Id. at 480-81. Because “the\\npresumptively impermissible applications of [the law] far outnumber[ed] any\\npermissible ones,” the Court held that the law was “substantially overbroad, and\\ntherefore invalid under the First Amendment.” Id. at 481-82. (pp. 14-17)\\n\\n3. Consistent with the Supreme Court’s approach, the “first step” in this appeal is to\\nexamine the text of the regulation to construe its scope. See id. at 474. The critical\\nlanguage in N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j) has few, if any, limits. It directs state actors to ask\\nvictims and witnesses not to speak with anyone about any aspect of any\\ninvestigation into harassment or discrimination. That request encompasses a great\\ndeal of protected speech, and it has no time limit. One exception appears in the text\\nof the rule -- victims and witnesses can disclose information if “there is a legitimate\\nbusiness reason to” do so -- but the regulation does not offer guidance about what\\nthat means. And the regulation does not require that victims be told they are free to\\ndecline to follow the request, that they can consult with an attorney about it, or that\\nthere will be no repercussions if they exercise their protected right to free speech.\\nAlthough framed as a request, there is an inherent power imbalance between the\\ninvestigator who makes the request and the witness who hears it, with the result that\\nmany employees will undoubtedly give up their right to speak freely. (pp. 17-20)\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n 4. Counsel for the Attorney General proposed revisions that would help address the\\nregulation’s broad scope, but the Court cannot expand and rewrite the final sentence\\nto render it constitutional. Id. at 481. The regulation is unconstitutionally\\noverbroad. The Court acknowledges the State’s good-faith representations that the\\nregulation can be narrowed, but it cannot rely on those representations to uphold the\\nrule. See id. at 480. The Court strikes the last sentence of N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j) on\\noverbreadth grounds based on the broad protections in the State Constitution. The\\nCourt explains why its opinion in R.M. v. Supreme Court of New Jersey, \\n185 N.J.\\n208\\n (2005), does not alter its analysis here. (pp. 20-22)\\n\\n5. In striking part of the regulation, the Court does not question the principles the\\nregulation tries to foster. The concerns addressed by confidentiality are entirely\\nlegitimate and are also important considerations in criminal and internal affairs\\ninvestigations. The Court stresses that nothing in its opinion should be construed to\\nlimit requests for confidentiality by investigators in those settings. (pp. 22-23)\\n\\n     REVERSED.

In addition, investigators are not\\n\\nrequired to tell victims and witnesses that they are free to disregard the State’s\\n\\nrequest.\\n\\n      In this case, an employee of the Department of Treasury lodged an\\n\\ninternal complaint that her manager sexually harassed her at work.\\n\\nInvestigators interviewed her and, consistent with the version of the regulation\\n\\nthen in effect, directed her not to discuss the investigation with anyone.\\n\\n      The Civil Service Commission (CSC) amended the regulation afterward.\\n\\nIt now calls on investigators to “request,” not “direct,” that victims and\\n\\nwitnesses remain silent about all aspects of the investigation. \\nIbid.\\n Plaintiff’s\\n\\ncomplaint in this appeal seeks a declaratory judgment that the current\\n\\nregulation is unconstitutional.\\n\\n      The State Constitution guarantees an affirmative right to speak freely\\n\\nthat is broader than the protections in the First Amendment. Compare\\n\\nN.J. Const. art. I, ¶ 6, with U.S. Const. amend. I. The guarantee extends to\\n\\nvictims of harassment and discrimination who have a right to speak out about\\n\\nwhat happened to them.\\n\\n      Although the regulation seeks to advance legitimate interests -- “to\\n\\nprotect the integrity of the investigation, minimize the risk of retaliation . . . ,\\n\\nand protect the important privacy interests of all concerned,” N.J.A.C. 4A:7-\\n\\n                                          3\\n 3.1(j), it reaches too far in trying to achieve those aims and chills\\n\\nconstitutionally protected speech. We therefore hold that the rule is overbroad\\n\\nunder the State Constitution. As a result, we reverse the judgment of the\\n\\nAppellate Division and strike the relevant part of the regulation.\\n\\n                                         I.\\n\\n      To recount the facts, we rely on the assertions in plaintiff Viktoriya\\n\\nUsachenok’s fourth amended complaint but make no findings of fact.\\n\\n      In May 2016, Usachenok filed an internal complaint with the Equal\\n\\nEmployment Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EEO/AA) office in the\\n\\nDepartment of Treasury. She claimed her supervisor John Mayo sexually\\n\\nharassed her and subjected her to a hostile work environment.\\n\\n      Bulisa Sanders, an EEO/AA investigator, and her supervisor, Deirdre\\n\\nWebster Cobb, met with Usachenok to investigate the complaint. At the\\n\\nmeeting, Usachenok stated that Mayo made sexual advances toward her, gave\\n\\nher unwanted gifts and love letters, and engaged in other inappropriate\\n\\nbehavior. Consistent with the text of N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j) (the “regulation” or\\n\\n“paragraph (j)”) at the time, Sanders directed Usachenok not to discuss the\\n\\ninvestigation with others and had her sign a form to acknowledge the\\n\\nconfidentiality directive. Sanders also advised Usachenok that she could be\\n\\ndisciplined if she violated the directive.\\n\\n                                         4\\n       According to Usachenok, at a meeting in June 2016, Sanders asked her\\n\\nto sign a statement the investigators had prepared that summarized her\\n\\nallegations. After reading the statement, Usachenok said it needed to be\\n\\nchanged “to accurately reflect her complaints.” When Sanders declined to\\n\\nmake the changes, Usachenok asked if she could call her husband. Her\\n\\nhusband, an attorney, advised her not to sign the document. According to\\n\\nUsachenok, Sanders then accused her of violating the confidentiality directive\\n\\nand threatened that she could be fired.\\n\\n      In late August 2016, Usachenok received a letter from another Treasury\\n\\ninvestigator that allegedly confirmed some but not all of her claims against\\n\\nMayo.\\n\\n      Usachenok filed a complaint against the Department of Treasury, Mayo,\\n\\nSanders, and Cobb on July 21, 2017. The fourth amended complaint alleged a\\n\\nhostile work environment, retaliation, and discrimination, among other claims.\\n\\nRelevant to this appeal, the complaint also challenged the confidentiality\\n\\ndirective in N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j).\\n\\n      On October 29, 2018, Usachenok filed an order to show cause and\\n\\nsought an order declaring the confidentiality directive of paragraph (j) null and\\n\\nvoid. Because the allegation challenged the validity of a rule promulgated by a\\n\\nstate agency, the State moved to transfer that part of the amended complaint to\\n\\n                                          5\\n the Appellate Division, pursuant to Rules 1:13-4 and 2:2-3(a). The trial court\\n\\ngranted the request.\\n\\n                                        II.\\n\\n        To provide context for what follows, we outline the regulation and its\\n\\nhistory here.\\n\\n        The regulation stems from Executive Order No. 106, which Governor\\n\\nChristine Todd Whitman issued in 1999. Exec. Order No. 106 (Dec. 17, 1999),\\n\\n32 N.J.R. 139(a) (Jan. 18, 2000). The Executive Order stressed the importance\\n\\nof prohibiting discrimination, harassment, or hostile environments in the\\n\\nworkplace. \\nIbid.\\n It also emphasized the need for model procedures to handle\\n\\ninternal complaints. \\nIbid.\\n To achieve those aims, the Governor put into effect\\n\\na policy submitted by the Department of Personnel. \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n        The Executive Order led to various changes to N.J.A.C. 4A:7. Among\\n\\nother amendments, N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(i) was added. It stated that, “[t]o the\\n\\nextent practical and appropriate under the circumstances, confidentiality shall\\n\\nbe maintained throughout the investigatory process.” 34 N.J.R. 261(a) (Jan. 7,\\n\\n2002). The regulation added that “[a]ll persons interviewed shall be directed\\n\\nnot to discuss any aspect of the investigation with others” and that “[f]ailure to\\n\\ncomply with this confidentiality directive may result in disciplinary action.”\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n                                         6\\n       In 2007, those confidentiality requirements were re-codified at N.J.A.C.\\n\\n4A:7-3.1(j) with minor changes. See 39 N.J.R. 3499(a) (Aug. 20, 2007). At\\n\\nthe time, paragraph (j) continued to mandate confidentiality and warn of\\n\\ndisciplinary action. It read in full as follows:\\n\\n            All complaints and investigations shall be handled, to\\n            the extent possible, in a manner that will protect the\\n            privacy interests of those involved. To the extent\\n            practical and appropriate under the circumstances,\\n            confidentiality shall be maintained throughout the\\n            investigatory process. In the course of an investigation,\\n            it may be necessary to discuss the claims with the\\n            person(s) against whom the complaint was filed and\\n            other persons who may have relevant knowledge or\\n            who have a legitimate need to know about the matter.\\n            All persons interviewed, including witnesses, shall be\\n            directed not to discuss any aspect of the investigation\\n            with others in light of the important privacy interests of\\n            all concerned.        Failure to comply with this\\n            confidentiality directive may result in administrative\\n            and/or disciplinary action, up to and including\\n            termination of employment.\\n\\n            [N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j) (2007) (emphases added).]\\n\\n      In 2019, while this appeal was pending, the CSC proposed to amend\\n\\nparagraph (j). 51 N.J.R. 1311(a) (Aug. 19, 2019). The amendment, adopted in\\n\\nMarch 2020, made two notable changes: (1) it removed language that\\n\\nmandated witnesses “be directed” not to speak with others and instead\\n\\nmandated that they be “request[ed]” not to do so; and (2) it eliminated the\\n\\n\\n                                         7\\n rule’s last sentence, which threatened disciplinary action. 52 N.J.R. 887(a)\\n\\n(Apr. 20, 2020). In proposing the change, the CSC stated investigators would\\n\\n“advise” people interviewed during an investigation “why it is important not to\\n\\ndisclose any aspect of the investigation to other persons without a legitimate\\n\\nand substantial business justification.” 51 N.J.R. 1311(a). The proposal also\\n\\nexplained that warning of “the imposition of a penalty could have a chilling\\n\\neffect on potential claimants.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      Paragraph (j) now reads as follows:\\n\\n            All complaints and investigations shall be handled, to\\n            the extent possible, in a manner that will protect the\\n            privacy interests of those involved. To the extent\\n            practical and appropriate under the circumstances,\\n            confidentiality shall be maintained throughout the\\n            investigative process.[1]      In the course of an\\n            investigation, it may be necessary to discuss the claims\\n            with the person(s) against whom the complaint was\\n            filed and other persons who may have relevant\\n            knowledge or who have a legitimate need to know\\n            about the matter. In order to protect the integrity of the\\n            investigation, minimize the risk of retaliation against\\n            the individuals participating in the investigative\\n            process, and protect the important privacy interests of\\n\\n1\\n   Because the second sentence of paragraph (j) is directed to the agency and\\nits personnel, as opposed to victims and witnesses, we do not address it\\nfurther. We also accept the State’s representation that other sections of the\\nregulation that discuss disciplinary action generally do not apply to paragraph\\n(j). See, e.g., N.J.A.C. 4A:7.31(d) and (k). For similar reasons, we do not\\nadopt the argument that the general language in N.J.A.C. 4A:2-2.3(a)(1)\\n(failure to perform duties), (2) (insubordination), or (12) (other sufficient\\ncause) provides a basis for disciplinary action with regard to paragraph (j).\\n                                         8\\n             all concerned, the EEO/AA Officer/investigator shall\\n            request that all persons interviewed, including\\n            witnesses, not discuss any aspect of the investigation\\n            with others, unless there is a legitimate business reason\\n            to disclose such information.\\n\\n            [N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j) (effective Apr. 20, 2020)\\n            (emphasis added).]\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division rejected Usachenok’s constitutional challenge to\\n\\nthe current regulation.\\n\\n      The appellate court focused on the following language in paragraph (j):\\n\\n“the EEO/AA Officer/investigator shall request that all persons interviewed,\\n\\nincluding witnesses, not discuss any aspect of the investigation.” (emphasis\\n\\nadded). The court found that “the plain language . . . does not restrict speech\\n\\nand does not constitute an improper prior restraint of speech.”\\n\\n      At the same time, the Appellate Division recognized that the word\\n\\n“request” may be considered a command depending upon the context in which\\n\\nit is used. Citing the CSC’s amendment to the regulation -- which replaced the\\n\\nterm “direct[]” with “request” -- the court observed that “the intent . . . was to\\n\\neliminate a confidentiality requirement and its potential chilling effect . . . and\\n\\nreplace[] it with a permissive ‘request.’” The appellate court explained that\\n\\nthe exception in the regulation -- for when “there is a legitimate business\\n\\n\\n                                         9\\n reason to disclose . . . information” -- further supports the permissive nature of\\n\\nthe request.\\n\\n        The Appellate Division also concluded that the amended regulation did\\n\\nnot violate the public policies underlying the Law Against Discrimination\\n\\n(LAD). In doing so, the court stressed the important values behind a request\\n\\nfor confidentiality: to “promote[] a fair investigatory process that protects\\n\\nboth the accuser and the accused while respecting the free-speech rights of\\n\\nall.”\\n\\n        The Appellate Division ultimately remanded the case to the trial court\\n\\nand directed it to enter an order dismissing Usachenok’s challenge to the\\n\\nregulation.\\n\\n        We granted Usachenok’s petition for certification. \\n253 N.J. 579\\n (2023).\\n\\nWe also granted leave to participate as a friend of the Court to the American\\n\\nCivil Liberties Union of New Jersey and the American Civil Liberties Union\\n\\n(jointly, the ACLU).\\n\\n                                        IV.\\n\\n        Usachenok contends the Appellate Division did not analyze whether the\\n\\nregulation has a chilling effect on an employee’s right to free speech. She\\n\\nmaintains the State’s intent in drafting the amendment does not answer that\\n\\ncritical question, and that paragraph (j) operates as an unconstitutional restraint\\n\\n                                        10\\n on speech. Usachenok also argues the current regulation is overbroad and\\n\\nvague, and that it violates the LAD. In addition, citing Stericycle, Inc. &\\n\\nTeamsters Local 628, 372 N.L.R.B. No. 113 (2023), Usachenok asks this Court\\n\\nto adopt a balancing test to determine the validity of confidentiality\\n\\nregulations.\\n\\n      The State argues that “because the request is truly a request, neither the\\n\\nState nor Federal Constitution is implicated.” Both the language of the\\n\\nregulation and its context, according to the State, make clear that no adverse\\n\\nconsequences follow from declining the request. The State asserts that the\\n\\namendment is a permissible expression of the government’s viewpoint that\\n\\nconfidentiality will protect the integrity of an investigation. The State\\n\\ntherefore maintains there is no basis to invalidate the regulation or promulgate\\n\\na new test. In addition, the State submits that nothing in the State Constitution\\n\\nor the LAD calls for a different outcome.\\n\\n      The ACLU stresses that the New Jersey Constitution provides broader\\n\\nprotection than the First Amendment and affords an independent ground to\\n\\nuphold Usachenok’s constitutional claim. Merely because the regulation\\n\\n“requests” confidentiality, the ACLU submits, does not insulate it from\\n\\nconstitutional scrutiny. The ACLU also asks the Court to adopt its own\\n\\nbalancing standard for public-employee speech claims.\\n\\n                                       11\\n       We granted Usachenok’s motion to expand the record. \\n252 N.J. 379\\n\\n\\n(2022). Because we do not rely on the additional information submitted, we\\n\\ndo not reference the parties’ arguments relating to it.\\n\\n                                        V.\\n\\n      Usachenok contends that the amended regulation violates her right to\\n\\nspeak freely under the State Constitution. We review constitutional challenges\\n\\nto statutes and regulations de novo. See State v. Hill, \\n256 N.J. 266\\n, 280 (2024)\\n\\n(statute); Ran-Dav’s Cnty. Kosher, Inc. v.

As a result, principles of\\n\\nfederal constitutional law, in general, help guide our analysis. \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      At the same time, we have found that the New Jersey Constitution\\n\\naffords greater protection than federal law in certain areas relating to free\\n\\nspeech.

Usachenok contends the regulation is unconstitutionally overbroad.\\n\\n      “Overbroad laws ‘may deter or “chill” constitutionally protected\\n\\nspeech[.]’” United States v. Hansen, \\n599 U.S. 762\\n, 769-70 (2023) (quoting\\n\\nVirginia v. Hicks, \\n539 U.S. 113\\n, 119 (2003)); Hill, 256 N.J. at 282-83. In\\n\\nthose situations, “would-be speakers [may] remain silent,” and “society”\\n\\nwould then “lose their contributions to the ‘marketplace of ideas.’” Hansen,\\n\\n599 U.S. at 770 (quoting Hicks, \\n539 U.S. at 119\\n). The overbreadth doctrine\\n\\nthus considers the extent of a law’s “deterrent effect on legitimate expression.”\\n\\nState v. Hoffman, \\n149 N.J. 564\\n, 582 (1997) (internal quotation omitted).\\n\\n      As this Court recently observed, “[o]verbreadth is unlike a typical facial\\n\\nchallenge.” Hill, 256 N.J. at 283. “[I]t does not require a challenger to\\n\\n‘establish that no set of circumstances exists under which [a statute] would be\\n\\nvalid.’” Ibid. (quoting Hansen, 599 U.S. at 769). Courts may find that a law is\\n\\nfacially invalid on overbreadth grounds “[i]f the challenger demonstrates that\\n\\nthe statute ‘prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech’ relative to its\\n\\n‘plainly legitimate sweep.’” Hansen, 599 U.S. at 770 (quoting United States v.\\n\\nWilliams, \\n553 U.S. 285\\n, 292 (2008)); accord Hill, 256 N.J. at 283; United\\n\\nStates v. Stevens, \\n559 U.S. 460\\n, 473 (2010).\\n\\n                                        14\\n       When a court holds a law facially unconstitutional under the overbreadth\\n\\ndoctrine, all enforcement of the law is suspended. Hicks, \\n539 U.S. at 119\\n. To\\n\\njustify that outcome, the “law’s unconstitutional applications must be realistic,\\n\\nnot fanciful,” and they “must be substantially disproportionate to the statute’s\\n\\nlawful sweep.” Hansen, 599 U.S. at 770; Hill, 256 N.J. at 283.\\n\\n      The United States Supreme Court’s application of the overbreadth\\n\\ndoctrine in Stevens illustrates the principle. In that case, the Court reviewed a\\n\\nfederal law that made it a crime to “create[], sell[], or possess[] a depiction of\\n\\nanimal cruelty,” if done for “commercial gain.” \\n559 U.S. at\\n464-65 (citing \\n18\\n\\nU.S.C. § 48\\n(a)). The statute defined “depiction of animal cruelty” as any\\n\\ndepiction “in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated,\\n\\ntortured, wounded, or killed, if such conduct” violated federal law or a law in\\n\\nthe state where “the maiming, mutilation, torture, wounding, or killing took\\n\\nplace.” \\nId.\\n at 465 n.1. The law’s primary intent, based on the legislative\\n\\nhistory, was to address “crush videos” that depicted “the intentional torture and\\n\\nkilling of helpless animals.” Id. at 465.\\n\\n      The allegations in Stevens involved depictions of animal fighting. Id. at\\n\\n466. The defendant argued the indictment was facially invalid under the First\\n\\nAmendment and moved to dismiss the charges. Id. at 467. The Supreme Court\\n\\nagreed. Id. at 482.\\n\\n                                        15\\n       The Court began its analysis by construing the law’s text. Id. at 474. As\\n\\nthe Court explained, “it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches\\n\\ntoo far without first knowing what the statute covers.” Ibid. (quoting\\n\\nWilliams, \\n553 U.S. at 293\\n). And when reading the law, the Court observed that\\n\\nit created an offense “of alarming breadth.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      Although the law purported to criminalize animal cruelty, “nowhere”\\n\\ndoes the statute “require[] that the depicted conduct be cruel.” \\nIbid.\\n In\\n\\naddition, although the text’s reference to intentionally maiming, mutilating,\\n\\nand torturing “convey[ed] cruelty,” wounding and killing did not. \\nIbid.\\n The\\n\\nCourt described multiple examples of hunting and livestock slaughter that\\n\\nwere illegal in only some parts of the country, yet the statute’s broad language\\n\\nprohibited their depiction everywhere. Id. at 474-77. Hunting periodicals and\\n\\ntelevision programs could likewise run afoul of the law. Id. at 476.\\n\\n      The Court declined to accept the Government’s representation that it\\n\\nwould use the statute “to reach only ‘extreme’ cruelty.” Id. at 480. It\\n\\nexplained it “would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the\\n\\nGovernment promised to use it responsibly.” Ibid. Nor could the Court\\n\\nrewrite the statute “to conform it to constitutional requirements.” Id. at 481\\n\\n(quoting Reno v. ACLU, \\n521 U.S. 844\\n, 884-85 (1997)). Because “the\\n\\npresumptively impermissible applications of [the law] far outnumber[ed] any\\n\\n                                       16\\n permissible ones,” the Court held that the law was “substantially overbroad,\\n\\nand therefore invalid under the First Amendment.” Id. at 481-82.\\n\\n                                       VI.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Consistent with the Supreme Court’s approach, the “first step” in this\\n\\nappeal is to examine the text of the regulation to construe its scope. See id. at\\n\\n474. In an overbreadth challenge, the proper focus belongs on “what the [law]\\n\\ncovers,” not what regulators or legislators may have intended it to cover. See\\n\\nid. at 465, 474.\\n\\n      We therefore begin with the critical language in paragraph (j), which is\\n\\nrather broad: “the EEO/AA Officer/investigator shall request that all persons\\n\\ninterviewed, including witnesses, not discuss any aspect of the investigation\\n\\nwith others.” N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j).\\n\\n      The section has few, if any, limits. It directs state actors to ask victims\\n\\nand witnesses to give up their constitutionally protected right to free speech. It\\n\\ncommands investigators to request complete confidentiality in every\\n\\ninvestigation. And it extends to all witnesses without exception. Taken at face\\n\\nvalue, victims and witnesses are asked not to speak with their spouse or an\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        17\\n attorney. Likewise, they may reasonably understand that they are being asked\\n\\nnot to contact other government agencies or law enforcement officials. 2\\n\\n      In short, the request is as simple as it is wide-ranging: not to speak with\\n\\nanyone about any aspect of any investigation into harassment or\\n\\ndiscrimination. That request encompasses a great deal of protected speech.\\n\\n      As described in the last sentence of paragraph (j), the request also has no\\n\\ntime limit. It appears to extend indefinitely, even beyond the end of an\\n\\ninvestigation.\\n\\n      One exception appears in the text of the rule: victims and witnesses can\\n\\ndisclose information if “there is a legitimate business reason to” do so. Ibid.\\n\\nThe regulation does not define the phrase or offer guidance about what it\\n\\n\\n2\\n  The State submits that employees can file a lawsuit or a complaint with the\\nDivision on Civil Rights consistent with N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(h). That section\\nprovides that employees cannot be retaliated against or subjected to “adverse\\nemployment consequences” for “bringing a complaint, providing information\\nfor an investigation, or testifying in any proceeding under this policy.”\\nParagraph (d) also states that “[a] person who wishes to take action about\\nprohibited sexual physical contact can file a criminal complaint with law\\nenforcement of the municipality where the incident occurred.” Id. at (d). But\\ninvestigators are not required to convey that information, and it is unclear how\\nvictims and witnesses unfamiliar with the regulation would know about those\\nsections.\\n\\n        More generally, the State suggests that any employee who is unsure of\\nthe regulation’s sweep can ask the investigator to clarify it. That approach\\nwould shift the onus onto victims and witnesses rather than keep the focus\\nwhere it belongs -- on the request investigators are required to make. See id.\\nat (j).\\n                                        18\\n means, and any reasonable person would find it difficult to understand the\\n\\nrule’s vague language.\\n\\n      What the regulation leaves out is also significant. It does not require\\n\\nthat victims be told they are free to decline to follow the request. They are not\\n\\ntold they can consult with an attorney about it. Nor are they told there will be\\n\\nno repercussions if they exercise their protected right to free speech.\\n\\n      Viewed as a whole, the unadorned language of the regulation extends\\n\\nquite broadly. The State, however, correctly points out that paragraph (j) no\\n\\nlonger directs victims and witnesses not to speak about investigations; it\\n\\ninstead requests them not to. Yet the way the request must be conveyed\\n\\nexacerbates its potential to chill protected speech.\\n\\n      There is an inherent power imbalance here between the investigator who\\n\\nmakes the request and the witness who hears it. Investigators speak on behalf\\n\\nof an agency of the State. Beyond that, victims and witnesses dependent on\\n\\ntheir employer can reasonably be concerned they may face consequences if\\n\\nthey fail to comply. Cf. Stericycle, 372 N.L.R.B. No. 113, at *2 (assessing\\n\\nfacial challenges to employer work rules and noting that “[b]ecause employees\\n\\nare typically (and understandably) anxious to avoid discharge or discipline,\\n\\nthey are reasonably inclined both to construe an ambiguous work rule to\\n\\nprohibit statutorily protected activities and to avoid the risk of violating the\\n\\n                                        19\\n rule by engaging in such activity”); NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., \\n395 U.S.\\n\\n575\\n, 617 (1969) (noting, in the labor relations setting, that balancing an\\n\\nemployer’s right of expression and the employees’ equal right to associate\\n\\nfreely “must take into account the economic dependence of the employees on\\n\\ntheir employers”). As a result, many employees will undoubtedly give up their\\n\\nright to speak freely and will remain silent.\\n\\n      At oral argument, counsel for the Attorney General stated that,\\n\\nconsistent with the intent of the regulation, investigators “should explain to the\\n\\nwitness that they are not required to” follow the request. Counsel also did not\\n\\nobject to the Court including in an opinion that the “request should be\\n\\naccompanied by . . . some language that makes it clear that [1] it is not\\n\\nmandatory and that [2] there [will be] no discipline.”\\n\\n      Revisions to the regulation of that type would help address its broad\\n\\nsweep. But we cannot expand and rewrite the final sentence of the regulation\\n\\nto render it constitutional. Stevens, \\n559 U.S. at 481\\n. Nor would changes of\\n\\nthe sort proposed be a candidate for judicial surgery. To save an otherwise\\n\\nunconstitutional rule, courts on occasion can “excise a constitutional defect or\\n\\nengraft a needed meaning” to ensure a statute’s survival. Hamilton\\n\\nAmusement Ctr. v. Verniero, \\n156 N.J. 254\\n, 280 (1998) (quoting Right to\\n\\nChoose v. Byrne, \\n91 N.J. 287\\n, 311 (1982)); accord State v. Natale, \\n184 N.J.\\n\\n20\\n\\n 458, 485 (2005). Adding substantial language to the regulation here, though,\\n\\nwould extend beyond the limits of judicial surgery.\\n\\n      We therefore hold that the regulation is unconstitutionally overbroad. Its\\n\\nbreadth encompasses a significant amount of protected speech, and its\\n\\nconsequences are real, “not fanciful.” See Hansen, 599 U.S. at 770. The\\n\\nscope of the rule will cause countless victims and witnesses to surrender their\\n\\nprotected right to speak freely about harassment and discrimination. Although\\n\\nwe acknowledge the State’s good-faith representations that the regulation can\\n\\nbe narrowed, we cannot rely on them to uphold the rule. See Stevens, \\n559\\n\\nU.S. at 480\\n. We therefore strike the last sentence of paragraph (j) on\\n\\noverbreadth grounds based on the broad protections in the State Constitution. 3\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      The Court’s opinion in R.M. v. Supreme Court of New Jersey, \\n185 N.J.\\n\\n208\\n (2005), does not alter the above analysis. In that case, the Court\\n\\ninvalidated the confidentiality provisions of Rule 1:20-9, which “mandate[d]\\n\\nthat a grievance filed against an attorney remain[] confidential until a formal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  For that reason, we do not rely on or discuss the standards the parties cite\\nfrom Pickering v. Board of Education, \\n391 U.S. 563\\n (1968), or Stericycle, 372\\nN.L.R.B. No. 113. Nor do we reach Usachenok’s argument based on the anti-\\nretaliation provisions of the LAD.\\n\\n                                       21\\n complaint is filed.” Id. at 211. 4 The confidentiality rule had five exceptions,\\n\\nnone of which applied to the case. Ibid.\\n\\n      In striking the rule’s broad requirement of confidentiality on First\\n\\nAmendment grounds, the Court observed that ethics committees can still\\n\\n“recommend that the grievant maintain the confidentiality of the process\\n\\nduring the investigatory stage and the grievant can agree to do so when it is in\\n\\nhis or her interest.” Id. at 229 (emphasis added). Paragraph (j) does not\\n\\nconvey the latter point. The Court in R.M. also noted that if ethics\\n\\ninvestigators “can establish a compelling need for secrecy based on the\\n\\nspecific and articulable facts of a case, [they] can seek an appropriate order\\n\\nrequiring confidentiality.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                          C.\\n\\n      In striking part of the regulation, we do not question the principles it\\n\\ntries to foster: “to protect the integrity of the investigation, minimize the risk\\n\\nof retaliation . . . , and protect the important privacy interests of all\\n\\nconcerned.” N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(j).\\n\\n      Confidentiality protects the privacy interests of all involved, particularly\\n\\nat a stage when allegations have yet to be proven. It also protects the integrity\\n\\n\\n4\\n  The current version of the Rule states that grievants may comment publicly\\nabout “the disciplinary process, the filing and content of the grievance, and the\\nresult.” R. 1:20-9(b). Respondents have the right to reply publicly. Ibid.\\n                                        22\\n of an investigation. Among other benefits, it prevents witnesses from\\n\\ncoordinating their stories either in an innocent or nefarious way.\\n\\nConfidentiality may also encourage reluctant witnesses to speak. And it can\\n\\nminimize the risk of retaliation during or after an investigation.\\n\\n      Those interests and concerns are entirely legitimate and are also\\n\\nimportant considerations in criminal and internal affairs investigations. See N.\\n\\nJersey Media Grp., Inc. v. Township of Lyndhurst, \\n229 N.J. 541\\n, 579 (2017).\\n\\nWe do not address those types of investigations here, and nothing in this\\n\\nopinion should be construed to limit requests for confidentiality by\\n\\ninvestigators in those settings.\\n\\n      State actors can express the government’s viewpoint. As the United\\n\\nStates Supreme Court observed in Matal v. Tam,\\n\\n            [t]he First Amendment prohibits Congress and other\\n            government entities and actors from “abridging the\\n            freedom of speech”; the First Amendment does not say\\n            that Congress and other government entities must\\n            abridge their own ability to speak freely. . . .\\n\\n            . . . . When a government entity embarks on a course\\n            of action, it necessarily takes a particular viewpoint and\\n            rejects others. The Free Speech Clause does not require\\n            government to maintain viewpoint-neutrality when its\\n            officers and employees speak about [a course of\\n            action].\\n\\n            [\\n582 U.S. 218\\n, 234 (2017).]\\n\\n                                        23\\n As a result, state investigators can explain the benefits of confidentiality to\\n\\nvictims and witnesses in investigations tied to the regulation. And victims, in\\n\\nturn, have the right to disagree and speak freely.\\n\\n      To be clear, the challenge here is not over the State’s legitimate\\n\\nconcerns. It is about how the current regulation sought to promote them.\\n\\n                                       VII.\\n\\n      For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the judgment of the\\n\\nAppellate Division and strike the last sentence of paragraph (j) on overbreadth\\n\\ngrounds under the State Constitution.

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n                State v. Andrew Higginbotham (A-57-22) (088035)\\n\\nArgued November 29, 2023 -- Decided May 8, 2024\\n\\nWAINER APTER, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       The Court considers whether subsection (c) of the definition of “portray a\\nchild in a sexually suggestive manner” in N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) is substantially\\noverbroad in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\n\\n       Defendant Andrew Higginbotham was charged with sixteen counts of\\nendangering the welfare of a child under subsection (c), which makes it a crime “to\\notherwise depict a child for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any\\nperson who may view the depiction where the depiction does not have serious\\nliterary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1). The charges\\narose from photographs he had distributed of a five-year-old girl. Defendant\\nsuperimposed sexually explicit, obscene text over the photos. He also distributed a\\nphoto of his clothed but aroused penis next to photos of the child, superimposed with\\nsexually explicit, obscene text. In all photos, the child was clothed.\\n\\n       Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, contending that subsection (c)\\nwas unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, either on its face or as applied to him.\\nThe trial court denied the motion. The Appellate Division reversed, holding that all\\nthree of the definitions of “portray a child in a sexually suggestive manner” set forth\\nin N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) -- i.e., subsection (c), which defendant had challenged, but\\nalso subsections (a) and (b), which he had not -- were unconstitutionally overbroad\\nbecause they criminalized images that constituted neither child pornography nor\\nobscenity. \\n475 N.J. Super. 205\\n, 233 (App. Div. 2023). The Court granted\\ncertification. \\n254 N.J. 515\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Subsection (c) of the definition of “portray a child in a sexually suggestive\\nmanner” in N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) is unconstitutionally overbroad because it\\ncriminalizes a large swath of material that is neither obscenity nor child\\npornography. Because defendant was not charged under subsections (a) or (b) of the\\ndefinition of “portray a child in a sexually suggestive manner,” and did not\\nchallenge subsections (a) or (b) before the trial court or the Appellate Division, the\\nCourt does not reach the validity of those subsections.\\n\\n                                           1\\n 1. Narrow categories of speech that are historically unprotected by the First\\nAmendment include fighting words, obscenity, child pornography, incitement,\\ndefamation, true threats, and speech integral to criminal conduct. Child erotica is\\nnot on the list, but both obscenity and child pornography are relevant to this case.\\nUnder Miller v. California, something is obscene if (1) “the average person,\\napplying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a\\nwhole, appeals to the prurient interest”; (2) “the work depicts or describes, in a\\npatently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state\\nlaw”; and (3) “the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or\\nscientific value.” \\n413 U.S. 15\\n, 24 (1973). Whereas states may constitutionally\\nproscribe the distribution of obscene material, possession of obscene material by the\\nindividual in the privacy of his own home is constitutionally protected. (pp. 13-14)\\n\\n2. In New York v. Ferber, the Court recognized a separate exception to the First\\nAmendment for child pornography. \\n458 U.S. 747\\n, 764 (1982). The Court has\\nupheld statutes that define child pornography as the portrayal of “sexual conduct” or\\n“sexual acts” by children, which includes the lewd or lascivious exhibition of, or\\ngraphic focus on, a child’s genitals or pubic area. Id. at 751-53, 762. Child\\npornography need not meet the Miller obscenity standard to be proscribed; it is a\\nseparate type of speech that is categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.\\nAnd unlike obscenity, states may constitutionally proscribe the possession and\\nviewing of child pornography in the privacy of one’s home. But laws that ban\\nimages that “do not involve, let alone harm, any children in the production process,”\\nviolate the First Amendment unless they conform to the Miller obscenity standard.\\nAshcroft v. Free Speech Coal., \\n535 U.S. 234\\n, 240-41 (2002). (pp. 14-17)\\n\\n3. A court may hold a law facially overbroad under the First Amendment “[i]f the\\nchallenger demonstrates that the statute ‘prohibits a substantial amount of protected\\nspeech’ relative to its ‘plainly legitimate sweep.’” United States v. Hansen, \\n599\\nU.S. 762\\n, 770 (2023). “[A] law’s unconstitutional applications must be realistic, not\\nfanciful, and their number must be substantially disproportionate to the statute’s\\nlawful sweep.” \\nIbid.\\n (pp. 17-18)\\n\\n4. “[A]n item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child” was formerly\\ndefined as an image that “depicts a child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the\\nsimulation of such an act.” N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) (2017). In 2017, the Legislature\\namended N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4 to expand the definition to include an image that\\n“portrays a child in a sexually suggestive manner,” which is defined in three ways in\\nsubsections (a) through (c). Subsections (a) and (b) use nearly identical language to\\ncriminalize any depiction of “a child’s less than completely and opaquely covered\\nintimate parts” or “any form of contact with a child’s intimate parts,” whereas\\nsubsection (c) uses different language to criminalize other depictions of children\\n“for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any person.” (pp. 19-21)\\n                                            2\\n 5. The first step in any overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute to\\ndetermine what it covers. Subsection (c) says nothing about obscenity. Although it\\nincorporates Miller’s third prong by requiring that “the depiction does not have\\nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,” it says nothing about Miller’s\\nfirst or second prongs. Subsection (c) therefore criminalizes a substantial amount of\\nspeech that does not legally constitute obscenity. Subsection (c) also strays far\\nbeyond the definition of child pornography set forth in Ferber. Where the\\ncriminalization depends only on whether “any person who may view the depiction”\\ncan use it “for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification,” and where the only\\nlimit is that the depiction lacks “serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific\\nvalue,” large swaths of protected material are conceivably ensnared. Indeed,\\ndepictions of something other than sexual contact and less than completely covered\\nintimate parts appear to be the only thing that subsection (c) can actually reach that\\nsubsections (a) and (b) do not. On its face, subsection (c) criminalizes only\\nmaterials that do not constitute child pornography. Because the application of\\nsubsection (c) to images that constitute neither obscenity nor child pornography is\\nrealistic, not fanciful, and is substantially disproportionate to subsection (c)’s lawful\\nsweep, subsection (c) is substantially overbroad. (pp. 23-27)\\n\\n6. The Court explains why it rejects the State’s suggestion that limiting language\\nfrom subsections (a) and (b) of the definition of “portray a child in a sexually\\nsuggestive manner” could be understood to apply to subsection (c) as well, noting\\nthat (a), (b), and (c) are disjunctive, that subsection (c) is not reasonably susceptible\\nto the State’s limiting construction, and that the Court cannot re-write a plainly\\nwritten legislative enactment. The Court also rejects the State’s claim that\\n“everything that subsection (c) covers . . . fits within” the Supreme Court’s most\\nrecent definition of child pornography in United States v. Williams, \\n553 U.S. 285\\n\\n(2008). In Williams, the Supreme Court proscribed “obscene material depicting\\n(actual or virtual) children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and any other\\nmaterial depicting actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.” \\nId. at 293\\n.\\nBut subsection (c) proscribes far more than that. (pp. 27-34)\\n\\n7. Because subsection (c) can be excised without impacting subsections (a) or (b),\\nthe Court holds that subsection (c) alone of the definition of “portray a child in a\\nsexually suggestive manner” contained in N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) is unconstitutional.\\nDefendant can be constitutionally prosecuted under New Jersey’s obscenity law but\\nnot under a different law that is unconstitutionally overbroad.

We hold that subsection (c) is unconstitutionally overbroad\\n\\nbecause it criminalizes a large swath of material that is neither obscenity nor\\n\\nchild pornography. We do not reach whether subsection (c) is also\\n\\nunconstitutionally vague. In addition, because defendant was not charged\\n\\nunder subsections (a) or (b) of the definition of “portray a child in a sexually\\n\\nsuggestive manner,” and did not challenge subsections (a) or (b) before the\\n\\ntrial court or the Appellate Division, we do not reach the validity of those\\n\\nsubsections. We therefore affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment as\\n\\nmodified.\\n\\n                                          I.\\n\\n                                         A.\\n\\n      In 2021, the Brooklawn Police Department learned that defendant\\n\\nAndrew Higginbotham had a journal with a photo of a young girl on the cover.\\n\\nWritten on top of the photo were the words “[c]**k in her little mouth” and\\n\\n“[c]*m on her face.” In an interview with police, defendant admitted that the\\n\\njournal was his, and said that he used it as a way “to express himself.”\\n\\n                                          3\\n       Defendant stated that the photo on the journal was of his friend’s\\n\\ndaughter “Christine,” 1 who was born in 2008. Detectives from the Camden\\n\\nCounty Prosecutor’s Office interviewed Christine; she did not allege sexual\\n\\nabuse. Detectives also interviewed Christine’s mother. She stated that she had\\n\\nbeen friends with defendant years earlier, but the friendship had ended, and\\n\\nthey were no longer in touch. However, about a month prior to the start of the\\n\\ninvestigation, she averred, defendant sent her a Facebook message.\\n\\n      Detectives obtained a warrant to search defendant’s Facebook accounts.\\n\\nThe search revealed that in February 2021, defendant distributed images of\\n\\nChristine from when she was five years old. The images included: (1) a photo\\n\\nof Christine wearing a black-and-white-striped shirt and pink tutu skirt; (2) a\\n\\nvideo with several photos of Christine and unknown girls wearing bikinis; and\\n\\n(3) a photo of Christine wearing jeans and a shirt with a smiley face emoji,\\n\\nkissing her sister. On top of each photo, defendant superimposed sexually\\n\\nexplicit text that he concedes is obscene. He then sent the images to different\\n\\nFacebook users.\\n\\n      Defendant also sent a Facebook user a collage of several photos,\\n\\nconsisting of a photo of his clothed but aroused penis next to photos of\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  The trial court and Appellate Division referred to the child as B.R. The\\nparties use the pseudonym Christine. We adopt the parties’ pseudonym here.\\n                                       4\\n Christine in the black-and-white-striped shirt and pink tutu, a black shirt with a\\n\\nspider web on it, and a blue shirt with a birthday girl ribbon on it. On top of\\n\\nthe photo collage, defendant again superimposed sexually explicit text that he\\n\\nconcedes is obscene. Defendant sent a similar photo collage, again\\n\\nsuperimposed with sexually explicit, obscene text, to other Facebook users as\\n\\nwell.\\n\\n        Some of the obscene text that defendant superimposed over the photos\\n\\ngraphically described violent sexual acts that he wanted to perform on\\n\\nChristine or wanted Christine to perform on him; others described defendant\\n\\n“wanting to molest” Christine. One photo was superimposed with defendant’s\\n\\n264-word sexual fantasy. In all photos, Christine was clothed.\\n\\n        In a second interview with police, defendant admitted to taking photos of\\n\\nChristine when he was friends with her mother years earlier and downloading\\n\\nadditional photos of Christine as a young child from her mother’s Facebook\\n\\npage. He admitted to superimposing obscene text over the photos of Christine\\n\\nand sending those new images to Facebook users he met in group chats about\\n\\nsex. Defendant confirmed that he sent the images “as satisfaction and pleasure\\n\\nfor himself” and to show others what he had. Although he admitted that he\\n\\nmasturbated to the images, defendant denied ever masturbating while\\n\\nphysically near Christine.\\n\\n                                        5\\n                                          B.\\n\\n      A grand jury charged defendant with seven counts of second-degree\\n\\nendangering the welfare of a child under N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(4); one count of\\n\\nthird-degree endangering the welfare of a child under N.J.S.A. 2C:24-\\n\\n4(b)(5)(b)(iii); seven counts of second-degree endangering the welfare of a\\n\\nchild under N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(5)(a)(i); and one count of second-degree\\n\\nendangering the welfare of a child under N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(5)(a)(ii).\\n\\n      The indictment alleged that defendant portrayed a child “in a sexually\\n\\nsuggestive manner by otherwise depicting a child for the purpose of sexual\\n\\nstimulation or gratification of any person who may view the depiction where\\n\\nthe depiction does not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific\\n\\nvalue.” That language mirrors subsection (c) of the definition of “portray a\\n\\nchild in a sexually suggestive manner” found in N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1)\\n\\n(hereinafter, “subsection (c)”). 2\\n\\n      Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment. He contended that\\n\\nsubsection (c) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in violation of the\\n\\nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution, either on its face or as\\n\\napplied to him. According to defendant, the photographs were “innocuous” in\\n\\n\\n2\\n  Fifteen of the sixteen counts explicitly quoted the language of subsection (c).\\nOne count did not, but the State conceded at oral argument that that count also\\ncharged defendant only under subsection (c) of the definition.\\n                                         6\\n that they were “of a fully clothed child, not suggestively posed,” and he then\\n\\n“superimposed” them with his own “personal sexual fantasies” without causing\\n\\nharm to Christine. Defendant also asserted that Christine was not “exploited\\n\\nby the production process since the photos themselves are not pornographic or\\n\\nsexually suggestive.” (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n      The trial court denied defendant’s motion. The court explained that\\n\\nsubsection (c) of the definition of “portray a child in a sexually suggestive\\n\\nmanner” was not vague because it clearly and unambiguously prohibited “the\\n\\nsexual exploitation of a child in those circumstances where the exposure of a\\n\\nchild’s intimate parts is not depicted, but nevertheless the depiction of a child\\n\\nis sexually suggestive.” The court also found that a jury could conclude\\n\\ndefendant violated the statute because he “defaced photographs and video of a\\n\\nchild with sexually explicit words and phrases for sexual stimulation or\\n\\ngratification of himself or others.” The trial court did not address defendant’s\\n\\noverbreadth challenge.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      Defendant successfully moved for leave to appeal, arguing that the trial\\n\\ncourt erred in holding that subsection (c) was not unconstitutionally vague or\\n\\noverbroad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        7\\n       In a published opinion, the Appellate Division reversed. State v.\\n\\nHigginbotham, \\n475 N.J. Super. 205\\n (App. Div. 2023). It held that all three of\\n\\nthe definitions of “portray a child in a sexually suggestive manner” set forth in\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) -- i.e., subsection (c), which defendant had challenged,\\n\\nbut also subsections (a) and (b), which he had not -- were unconstitutionally\\n\\noverbroad because they criminalized images that constituted neither child\\n\\npornography nor obscenity. \\nId. at 233\\n.\\n\\n      As the Appellate Division explained, the definitions went beyond child\\n\\npornography because they “include[d] images of children who are not engaged\\n\\nin sex acts or whose genitals are not lewdly displayed.” \\nIbid.\\n The definitions\\n\\nwere thus “at odds with” New York v. Ferber, \\n458 U.S. 747\\n (1982), Osborne v.\\n\\nOhio, \\n495 U.S. 103\\n (1990), and Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, \\n535 U.S.\\n\\n234\\n (2002), which together defined child pornography as “an image of a child\\n\\nengaged in a sex act or the image of a child with their genitals lewdly\\n\\ndisplayed.” Higginbotham, 475 N.J. Super. at 233.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division pointed out that the three definitions of “portray\\n\\na child in a sexually suggestive manner” in N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) do not\\n\\n“require the child’s genitals be visible in the image or the child be engaged in\\n\\nany type of sexual activity.” Id. at 234. According to the Appellate Division,\\n\\nthe definitions could thus criminalize: (1) “[a] picture taken on a public beach,\\n\\n                                         8\\n which includes children or teenagers in swimsuits, applying sunscreen on each\\n\\nother or themselves”; (2) “photographs taken for telehealth medical diagnostic\\n\\npurposes -- like a rash or other skin condition”; and (3) “[d]epictions of certain\\n\\ntypes of sporting events -- such as wrestling, cheerleading, gymnastics, or\\n\\ntrack and field.” Ibid.\\n\\n      The statutory definitions also did not proscribe obscenity because they\\n\\ndid not incorporate all three elements of the Miller v. California obscenity\\n\\nstandard, which the Appellate Division held was required “to comply with the\\n\\nFirst Amendment.” Id. at 236-37 (citing \\n413 U.S. 15\\n, 24 (1973)). And even if\\n\\nthe statutory definitions had incorporated the three prongs of the Miller\\n\\nstandard, by criminalizing mere possession of obscene material, they would\\n\\ninfringe “an adult’s right to view and possess obscene material in the privacy\\n\\nof their home.” \\nId. at 233\\n, 235-36 (citing Stanley v. Georgia, \\n394 U.S. 557\\n,\\n\\n560-61 (1969)).\\n\\n      The Appellate Division rejected the State’s argument that the images\\n\\ndefendant created constituted “morphed” child pornography, pointing out that\\n\\nChristine’s “photographic image was not edited at all”; instead, “[d]efendant\\n\\nsimply added text to her picture.” Id. at 238. And although defendant’s words\\n\\n“paint[ed] a mental picture of a child engaged in a sex act . . . [h]is words\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        9\\n alone created [that] mental picture.” Ibid. 3 The court acknowledged “the\\n\\npotential for reputational and emotional harm to” Christine, but found that\\n\\ndefendant’s images were “not a record of past [child] abuse, even fake abuse.”\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n                                         D.\\n\\n        We granted the State’s petition for certification and its motion for a stay\\n\\nof the Appellate Division’s decision. \\n254 N.J. 515\\n (2023). We also granted\\n\\nleave to the County Prosecutor’s Association of New Jersey (CPANJ), the\\n\\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL), and the\\n\\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU) to appear as amici\\n\\ncuriae.\\n\\n                                         II.\\n\\n        The State maintains that subsection (c) “properly construed, targets only\\n\\nimages proscribable under Ferber.” In the State’s reading, subsection (c)’s use\\n\\nof the word “otherwise” “signals that the provision operates as a residual\\n\\nclause, and therefore must be read to cover ‘categories similar in type to those\\n\\nspecifically enumerated’ in subsections (a) and (b).” (quoting Paroline v.\\n\\nUnited States, \\n572 U.S. 434\\n, 447 (2014)). Subsections (a) and (b) cover only\\n\\n\\n3\\n  The Appellate Division noted that defendant’s words were “undoubtedly”\\nobscene under N.J.S.A. 2C:34-2, but the State did not charge defendant with\\nany violation of that statute. \\nId.\\n at 238 n.6.\\n                                         10\\n images that “concentrate prurient interest on the child” and their “intimate\\n\\nparts” -- thus, according to the State, “the same is true of subsection (c).”\\n\\nUnder the State’s reading, therefore, subsection (c) only prohibits child\\n\\npornography that may be constitutionally criminalized. Even if subsection (c)\\n\\ndid reach some protected speech, the State argues, “any such overbreadth\\n\\nwould be at most minor.” Finally, the State avers, because defendant was not\\n\\ncharged under subsection (a) or (b) and did not challenge subsections (a) or\\n\\n(b), “the [Appellate Division] should not have sua sponte addressed\\n\\nsubsections (a) and (b),” and certainly should not have struck them down.\\n\\n      CPANJ agrees with the State. It also contends that “child erotica” is\\n\\n“harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of” children in the\\n\\nsame ways as child pornography, and therefore “should not be granted any\\n\\nconstitutional protection.”\\n\\n      Defendant argues that “[c]hild erotica is not its own category of speech\\n\\nexempt from [the] First Amendment.” Instead, “lawmakers can\\n\\nconstitutionally prohibit child erotica in only two ways: by criminalizing child\\n\\nerotica that is obscene under [Miller], or by criminalizing child erotica that is\\n\\npornographic under [Ferber].” Because subsection (c) reaches a substantial\\n\\namount of protected speech “that is neither obscene nor child pornography, it\\n\\nis unconstitutionally overbroad.” According to defendant, by proscribing any\\n\\n                                        11\\n image that “otherwise depict[s] a child for the purpose of sexual stimulation or\\n\\ngratification of any person who may view the depiction,” N.J.S.A. 2C:24-\\n\\n4b(1), without requiring that the images be “prurient, offensive, nude, or\\n\\nlewd,” the statute could criminalize photos of children at a playground, on a\\n\\nbeach, or playing sports; children “posing suggestively in a bathing suit or\\n\\nHalloween costume”; or children “performing suggestively in a dance recital\\n\\nor beauty pageant.”\\n\\n      The ACDL states that New Jersey is one of only three states that have\\n\\nattempted to criminalize child erotica. According to the ACDL, subsection (c)\\n\\nis overbroad because it “criminalize[s] a significant universe of speech that is\\n\\nneither ‘child pornography’ under [Ferber] nor ‘obscene’ under [Miller].” But\\n\\nconstruing the statute in the way the State does “would require the Court to\\n\\nsubstantially re-write the entire statutory scheme,” the ACDL maintains,\\n\\nviolating this Court’s role -- to “interpret and apply the law, not to write it.”\\n\\n      The ACLU contends that “if the depiction at issue does not result from\\n\\nthe sexual exploitation of children, no matter how abhorrent the content, it\\n\\ndoes not fall within the child pornography exception to the First Amendment.”\\n\\nBecause the statute “1) expands the definition of child pornography to include\\n\\nimages of children who are not engaged in sex acts or whose genitals are not\\n\\nlewdly displayed; and 2) regulates the private possession of child erotica,\\n\\n                                         12\\n which . . . is not defined using the terms of the Miller obscenity standard,” it is\\n\\nunconstitutionally overbroad. Moreover, the ACLU predicts, “the risks of\\n\\novercriminalization may fall disproportionately on sexual minorities, i.e., the\\n\\nLGBTQ+ community.”\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable\\n\\nto the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, instructs that “Congress shall\\n\\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend.

Hill, \\n256 N.J. 266\\n, 281 (2024). Narrow categories of\\n\\nspeech that are historically unprotected by the First Amendment “include\\n\\nfighting words, obscenity, child pornography, incitement, defamation, true\\n\\nthreats, and speech integral to criminal conduct.” \\nIbid.\\n Child erotica is not on\\n\\nthe list, but both obscenity and child pornography are relevant to this case.\\n\\n      The United States Supreme Court initially defined obscenity in Roth v.\\n\\nUnited States, \\n354 U.S. 476\\n (1957), and then refined the definition in Miller v.\\n\\n                                        13\\n California. Under Miller, something is obscene if (1) “the average person,\\n\\napplying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken\\n\\nas a whole, appeals to the prurient interest”; (2) “the work depicts or describes,\\n\\nin a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the\\n\\napplicable state law”; and (3) “the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious\\n\\nliterary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” 413 U.S. at 24 (quotations\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n       Whereas states may constitutionally proscribe the distribution of obscene\\n\\nmaterial, “mere possession [of obscene material] by the individual in the\\n\\nprivacy of his own home” is constitutionally protected. Stanley, \\n394 U.S. at\\n\\n568\\n.\\n\\n       In New York v. Ferber, the Court recognized a separate exception to the\\n\\nFirst Amendment for child pornography. \\n458 U.S. at 764\\n. The Court has\\n\\nupheld statutes that define child pornography as the portrayal of “sexual\\n\\nconduct” or “sexual acts” by children, which includes the lewd or lascivious\\n\\nexhibition of, or graphic focus on, a child’s “genitals or pubic area.” \\nId. at\\n\\n751-53, 762\\n; Osborne, \\n495 U.S. at 107, 112\\n; United States v.

Osborne, \\n495 U.S. at 111\\n.\\n\\n      In Ferber, the Supreme Court discussed why states “are entitled to\\n\\ngreater leeway” in proscribing child pornography than they are in regulating\\n\\nobscenity. \\n458 U.S. at 756\\n. Several of the Court’s reasons bear mention here.\\n\\n      First, states have a compelling interest in “safeguarding the physical and\\n\\npsychological well-being” of children, and specifically in preventing their\\n\\n“sexual exploitation and abuse.” \\nId. at 756-57\\n (quotation omitted). Child\\n\\npornography is “harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health” of\\n\\nthe children used in its production, and its creation constitutes child sexual\\n\\nabuse. \\nId. at 758\\n; see also Free Speech Coal., \\n535 U.S. at 249, 254\\n (under\\n\\n\\n\\nincluding the “lascivious exhibition of the anus, genitals, or pubic area of any\\nperson”); 720 Ill.

Stat. 5/11-20.1(a)(i)(vii) (defining child pornography\\nas including the “lewd exhibition of the unclothed or transparently clothed\\ngenitals, pubic area, buttocks, or, if such person is female, a fully or partially\\ndeveloped breast of the child or other person”); Mass. Gen.

Ferber, \\n458 U.S. at 759\\n. Later cases have\\n\\nexplained that the circulation of child pornography can “cause[] the child\\n\\nvictims continuing harm by haunting the children in years to come,” Osborne,\\n\\n495 U.S. at 111\\n, and causes a “new injury to the child’s reputation and\\n\\nemotional well-being” with each re-publication, Free Speech Coal., \\n535 U.S. at\\n\\n249\\n; see also Paroline, \\n572 U.S. at 440-41\\n (A young woman who was sexually\\n\\nabused to produce child pornography told the court, after learning that her\\n\\nimages were being trafficked on the Internet: “[e]very day of my life I live in\\n\\nconstant fear that someone will see my pictures and recognize me and that I\\n\\nwill be humiliated all over again. It hurts me to know someone is looking at\\n\\nthem -- at me -- when I was just a little girl being abused for the camera. . . .\\n\\nIt’s like I am being abused over and over and over again.”).\\n\\n      And third, because it is “irrelevant to the child [who has been abused]”\\n\\nby the pornography’s creation whether the final product has “literary, artistic,\\n\\n                                        16\\n political or social value,” the Miller standard does not vindicate the State’s\\n\\ninterest in preventing child sexual abuse and therefore need not be satisfied.\\n\\nFerber, \\n458 U.S. at 761\\n (alteration in original) (quotation omitted).\\n\\n      In keeping with the State’s compelling interest “in protecting the\\n\\nchildren exploited by the [child pornography] production process,” the\\n\\nSupreme Court subsequently clarified that child pornography can be banned,\\n\\nconsistent with the First Amendment, if it is “produced” using “real children.”\\n\\nFree Speech Coal., \\n535 U.S. at 240, 245-46\\n. Laws that ban images that “do\\n\\nnot involve, let alone harm, any children in the production process,” do not\\n\\nsatisfy the government’s compelling interest in protecting children from sexual\\n\\nabuse recognized in Ferber, and therefore violate the First Amendment unless\\n\\nthey conform to the Miller obscenity standard. \\nId. at 240-41\\n; see also \\nid. at\\n\\n251\\n (“[W]here the speech is neither obscene nor the product of sexual abuse, it\\n\\ndoes not fall outside the protection of the First Amendment.”).\\n\\n      Here, defendant contends that the statute under which he was charged is\\n\\nunconstitutionally overbroad because it criminalizes speech that is neither\\n\\nobscenity nor child pornography. The First Amendment’s overbreadth\\n\\ndoctrine is “unusual” in two ways. United States v. Hansen, \\n599 U.S. 762\\n, 769\\n\\n(2023). First, although a defendant generally may not “assert the\\n\\nconstitutional rights of third parties,” ibid., overbreadth allows a successful\\n\\n                                        17\\n constitutional challenge even from a person “to whom a statute may be\\n\\nconstitutionally applied,” Massachusetts v. Oakes, \\n491 U.S. 576\\n, 581 (1989).\\n\\n      Second, unlike a typical facial challenge, a First Amendment\\n\\noverbreadth challenge does not require the defendant to “establish that no set\\n\\nof circumstances exists under which the [statute] would be valid.” Hansen,\\n\\n599 U.S. at 769 (alteration in original) (emphasis omitted) (quoting United\\n\\nStates v. Salerno, \\n481 U.S. 739\\n, 745 (1987)). Instead, a court may hold a law\\n\\nfacially overbroad under the First Amendment “[i]f the challenger\\n\\ndemonstrates that the statute ‘prohibits a substantial amount of protected\\n\\nspeech’ relative to its ‘plainly legitimate sweep.’” Hansen, 599 U.S. at 770\\n\\n(quoting Williams, \\n553 U.S. at 292\\n).\\n\\n      Because the overbreadth doctrine is “strong medicine,” it is to be used\\n\\n“only as a last resort.” Ferber, \\n458 U.S. at 769\\n (quoting Broadrick v.\\n\\nOklahoma, \\n413 U.S. 601\\n, 613 (1973)). In this regard, “a law’s\\n\\nunconstitutional applications must be realistic, not fanciful, and their number\\n\\nmust be substantially disproportionate to the statute’s lawful sweep.” Hansen,\\n\\n599 U.S. at 770. “In the absence of a lopsided ratio” of unconstitutional\\n\\napplications to constitutional ones, “courts must handle unconstitutional\\n\\napplications as they usually do -- case-by-case.” Ibid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       18\\n                                         B.\\n\\n      Defendant was charged with four types of crimes under New Jersey’s\\n\\nchild endangerment statute: creation, distribution, possession with intent to\\n\\ndistribute, and simple possession of items depicting the sexual exploitation or\\n\\nabuse of a child. N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(4) criminalizes the use of “any device,\\n\\nincluding a computer, to reproduce or reconstruct the image of a child in a\\n\\nprohibited sexual act or . . . for portrayal in a sexually suggestive manner.”\\n\\nUnder N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(5)(a)(i) and (ii), “[a] person commits a crime if, by\\n\\nany means . . . he: (i) knowingly distributes an item depicting the sexual\\n\\nexploitation or abuse of a child; [or] (ii) knowingly possesses an item\\n\\ndepicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child with the intent to\\n\\ndistribute that item.” N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(5)(b)(iii) criminalizes the knowing\\n\\npossession of “less than 1,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse\\n\\nof a child.”\\n\\n      Prior to February 2018, “an item depicting the sexual exploitation or\\n\\nabuse of a child” was defined only as an image that “depicts a child engaging\\n\\nin a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act.” N.J.S.A. 2C:24-\\n\\n4(b)(1) (2017). In 2017, the Legislature amended N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4 to expand\\n\\nthe definition. S. L. & Pub. Safety Comm. Statement to S. 3219 1 (June 15,\\n\\n2017). Mindful of “changes in the child pornography industry which are not\\n\\n                                        19\\n adequately addressed by current law” and the lack of statutory coverage for\\n\\n“images that depict nearly naked, suggestively-posed, and inappropriately\\n\\nsexualized children,” the Legislature expanded the definition of “item\\n\\ndepicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child” to include an image that\\n\\n“portrays a child in a sexually suggestive manner.” Ibid. This is what the\\n\\nparties refer to as the Child Erotica Amendments.\\n\\n      The amended definition of “item depicting the sexual exploitation or\\n\\nabuse of a child” is now: “a photograph, film, video,” computer image, or\\n\\n“any other reproduction or reconstruction which: (a) depicts a child engaging\\n\\nin a prohibited sexual act 5 or in the simulation of such an act; or (b) portrays a\\n\\nchild in a sexually suggestive manner.” N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) (emphasis\\n\\nadded).\\n\\n      The statute then defines “portray a child in a sexually suggestive\\n\\nmanner” as:\\n\\n              (a) to depict a child’s less than completely and opaquely\\n              covered intimate parts, as defined in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-1, 6\\n              in a manner that, by means of the posing, composition,\\n              format, or animated sensual details, emits sensuality\\n\\n5\\n  “Prohibited sexual act” includes, among other things, “[n]udity, if depicted\\nfor the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of any person who may\\nview such depiction,” and “[a]ny act of sexual penetration or sexual contact as\\ndefined in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-1.” N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1).\\n6\\n  Under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-1(e), “intimate parts” means “sexual organs, genital\\narea, anal area, inner thigh, groin, buttock or breast of a person.”\\n                                         20\\n             with sufficient impact to concentrate prurient interest\\n            on the child; or\\n\\n            (b) to depict any form of contact with a child’s intimate\\n            parts, as defined in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-1, in a manner that,\\n            by means of the posing, composition, format, or\\n            animated sensual details, emits sensuality with\\n            sufficient impact to concentrate prurient interest on the\\n            child; or\\n\\n            (c) to otherwise depict a child for the purpose of sexual\\n            stimulation or gratification of any person who may\\n            view the depiction where the depiction does not have\\n            serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) (emphasis added).]\\n\\nAs is clear from the text, subsections (a) and (b) of the definition use nearly\\n\\nidentical language to criminalize any depiction of “a child’s less than\\n\\ncompletely and opaquely covered intimate parts” or “any form of contact with\\n\\na child’s intimate parts,” whereas subsection (c) uses different language to\\n\\ncriminalize other depictions of children “for the purpose of sexual stimulation\\n\\nor gratification of any person.”\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      We review the constitutionality of this and all New Jersey statutes de\\n\\nnovo, owing no deference to the legal conclusions of the Appellate Division or\\n\\ntrial court. State v. Hemenway, \\n239 N.J. 111\\n, 125 (2019).\\n\\n      Democratically enacted laws “are presumed constitutional.” Whirlpool\\n\\nProps. Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Tax’n, \\n208 N.J. 141\\n, 175 (2011). We apply “every\\n                                        21\\n possible presumption” in favor of the validity of a challenged statute,\\n\\nrecognizing that it “represents the considered action of a body composed of\\n\\npopularly elected representatives.” State v. Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts,\\n\\nInc., \\n160 N.J. 505\\n, 526 (1999) (quotations omitted). We will thus not strike a\\n\\nstatute as unconstitutional “unless its repugnancy to the Constitution is clear\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Smith, \\n251 N.J. 244\\n, 263 (2022) (quoting\\n\\nState v. Lenihan, \\n219 N.J. 251\\n, 266 (2014)).\\n\\n      We also “construe a challenged statute to avoid constitutional defects if\\n\\nthe statute is reasonably susceptible” to such a construction. Lenihan, \\n219 N.J.\\n\\nat 266\\n (quotation omitted). However, statutory construction begins with an\\n\\nexamination of the plain language of the statute, “ascrib[ing] to the . . . words\\n\\ntheir ordinary meaning and significance.” DiProspero v. Penn, \\n183 N.J. 477\\n,\\n\\n492 (2005). We “may neither rewrite a plainly-written enactment of the\\n\\nLegislature nor presume that the Legislature intended something other than\\n\\nthat expressed by way of the plain language.” O’Connell v. State, \\n171 N.J.\\n\\n484\\n, 488 (2002).\\n\\n      If we find a portion of a statute unconstitutional, the Legislature has\\n\\nmandated a presumption of severability. See N.J.S.A. 1:1-10. We will\\n\\ntherefore sever any unconstitutional provision so long as “the invalid portion is\\n\\nindependent,” and the remainder of the statute, without the invalid provision,\\n\\n                                        22\\n can “form[] a complete act within itself.” Inganamort v. Borough of Fort Lee,\\n\\n72 N.J. 412\\n, 423 (1977).\\n\\n                                         IV.\\n\\n      With this background in mind, we hold that subsection (c) is\\n\\nunconstitutionally overbroad. We do not reach whether subsection (c) is\\n\\nvague, and we do not reach the validity of subsections (a) or (b). We therefore\\n\\naffirm the Appellate Division’s decision as modified.\\n\\n                                         A.\\n\\n      We agree with defendant and the Appellate Division that subsection (c)\\n\\nis unconstitutionally overbroad because it criminalizes a substantial amount of\\n\\nmaterial that is neither obscene nor child pornography, and therefore “does not\\n\\nfall outside the protection of the First Amendment.” Free Speech Coal., \\n535\\n\\nU.S. at 251\\n.\\n\\n      The first step in any overbreadth analysis is to “construe the challenged\\n\\nstatute” to determine what it covers. Williams, \\n553 U.S. at 293\\n. Recall that in\\n\\nconjunction with the substantive provisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1),\\n\\nsubsection (c) of the definition of “portray a child in a sexually suggestive\\n\\nmanner” makes it a crime “to otherwise depict a child for the purpose of sexual\\n\\nstimulation or gratification of any person who may view the depiction where\\n\\nthe depiction does not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific\\n\\n                                         23\\n value.” As earlier noted, while subsections (a) and (b) use nearly identical\\n\\nlanguage to criminalize any depiction of “a child’s less than completely and\\n\\nopaquely covered intimate parts” or “any form of contact with a child’s\\n\\nintimate parts,” subsection (c) uses different language to criminalize other\\n\\ndepictions of children “for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of\\n\\nany person.”\\n\\n      The State does not contend that subsection (c) is limited to material that\\n\\nmeets the Supreme Court’s definition of obscenity. For good reason. The\\n\\nstatute says nothing about obscenity, and it does not incorporate the three\\n\\nprongs of the Miller obscenity standard into its definition of what material is\\n\\nproscribed. Subsection (c) incorporates Miller’s third prong by requiring that\\n\\n“the depiction does not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific\\n\\nvalue.” But whereas subsections (a) and (b) require that the depiction “emits\\n\\nsensuality with sufficient impact to concentrate prurient interest on the child,”\\n\\nsubsection (c) says nothing about Miller’s first prong -- that “the average\\n\\nperson, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work\\n\\n. . . appeals to the prurient interest.” Miller, \\n413 U.S. at 24\\n. Subsection (c)\\n\\nalso does not mention Miller’s second prong -- that the work depict “sexual\\n\\nconduct specifically defined by the applicable state law” in a way that is\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         24\\n “patently offensive.” \\nIbid.\\n Subsection (c) therefore criminalizes a substantial\\n\\namount of speech that does not legally constitute obscenity.\\n\\n      Nor is subsection (c) limited to material that legally constitutes child\\n\\npornography. As earlier noted, the Supreme Court has upheld statutes that\\n\\ndefine child pornography as the portrayal of “sexual conduct” or “sexual acts”\\n\\nby children, Ferber, \\n458 U.S. at 764\\n, including the lewd or lascivious\\n\\nexhibition of, or graphic focus on, a child’s “genitals or pubic area,” \\nid.\\n at 751-\\n\\n53, 762; Osborne, \\n495 U.S. at 107, 112\\n; Williams, \\n553 U.S. at 290\\n. Federal\\n\\nstatutes and statutes from other states have also included within the definition\\n\\nthe lascivious or lewd exhibition of uncovered or transparently clothed\\n\\nbuttocks or breasts. See supra, n.4.\\n\\n      Subsection (c) strays far beyond this “suitably limited and described”\\n\\ndefinition of child pornography. Ferber, \\n458 U.S. at 764\\n. While subsection (a)\\n\\nmakes it a crime “to depict a child’s less than completely and opaquely\\n\\ncovered intimate parts” and subsection (b) makes it a crime to “depict any\\n\\nform of contact with a child’s intimate parts,” and both require that the\\n\\ndepiction “emit[] sensuality with sufficient impact to concentrate prurient\\n\\ninterest on the child,” subsection (c) does not require that the depiction be of\\n\\n“a child’s less than completely and opaquely covered intimate parts,” or “any .\\n\\n. . contact with a child’s intimate parts.” And it does not require that the\\n\\n                                        25\\n depiction “emit[] sensuality with sufficient impact to concentrate prurient\\n\\ninterest on the child.” 7 Given subsection (c)’s lack of reference to “less than\\n\\ncompletely covered intimate parts,” “contact with intimate parts,” “sensuality,”\\n\\nor “prurient interest,” defendant and the Appellate Division are correct to fear\\n\\nthat, on its face, subsection (c) could criminalize photos of children on the\\n\\nbeach, at sporting events, or performing in a dance recital or beauty pageant.\\n\\nWhere the criminalization depends only on whether “any person who may\\n\\nview the depiction” can use it “for the purpose of sexual stimulation or\\n\\ngratification,” and where the only limit is that the depiction lacks “serious\\n\\nliterary, artistic, political, or scientific value,” large swaths of protected\\n\\nmaterial are conceivably ensnared.\\n\\n      This is not a “fanciful” hypothetical -- depictions of something other\\n\\nthan sexual contact and less than completely covered intimate parts appear to\\n\\nbe the only thing that subsection (c) can actually reach that subsections (a) and\\n\\n(b) do not. On its face, subsection (c) criminalizes only materials that do not\\n\\nconstitute child pornography -- materials that do not depict “sexual conduct”\\n\\nor “sexual acts” by children -- and that do not lasciviously or lewdly depict a\\n\\nchild’s genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or breast. The State has not come\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n  As earlier noted, our holding concerns only the validity of subsection (c),\\nand says nothing about the validity of subsections (a) or (b).\\n                                       26\\n forward with, and we have not otherwise found, any prosecution brought only\\n\\nunder subsection (c) based on material that meets the Supreme Court’s\\n\\ndefinition of child pornography. Likewise, the State has not suggested any\\n\\nimage that could be criminalized by subsection (c), but not by subsections (a)\\n\\nor (b), that would meet that definition.\\n\\n      We are mindful that facial overbreadth requires the challenger to\\n\\ndemonstrate that the statute “prohibits a substantial amount of protected\\n\\nspeech” relative to its “plainly legitimate sweep.” Hansen, 599 U.S. at 770.\\n\\nBecause the application of subsection (c) to images that constitute neither\\n\\nobscenity nor child pornography is realistic, not fanciful, and is substantially\\n\\ndisproportionate to subsection (c)’s lawful sweep, we hold that subsection (c)\\n\\nis substantially overbroad.\\n\\n                                           B.\\n\\n      The State disagrees, now contending that subsection (c) is not\\n\\nsubstantially overbroad because “properly construed,” it targets only child\\n\\npornography. According to the State’s current position, “[b]ecause subsection\\n\\n(c) is the final prong of [a] three-part list, introduced with the word\\n\\n‘otherwise,’ it is a ‘catch-all’ clause that covers images that, objectively,\\n\\nconcentrate the prurient interest on a child in a similar manner and to a similar\\n\\ndegree as subsections (a) and (b).” Citing Paroline, \\n572 U.S. at 447\\n, and State\\n\\n                                           27\\n v. Hoffman, \\n149 N.J. 564\\n, 579 (1997), the State relies on what it calls the\\n\\n“familiar canon of statutory construction that catchall clauses are to be read as\\n\\nbringing within a statute categories similar in type to those specifically\\n\\nenumerated.” In the State’s telling, because subsections (a) and (b) only\\n\\nprohibit images that “emit[] sensuality with sufficient impact to concentrate\\n\\nprurient interest on the child” and “their ‘intimate parts,’” the same is also true\\n\\nfor (c).\\n\\n       The State made no such argument before the trial court or the Appellate\\n\\nDivision. Neither did the Attorney General, when it participated as amicus\\n\\ncuriae in support of the State before the Appellate Division. In any event, the\\n\\nState’s current interpretation runs directly counter to the statutory text.\\n\\n       As an initial matter, the word “otherwise” generally does not mean “in a\\n\\nsimilar manner and to a similar degree.” It means the opposite. As an adverb,\\n\\nthe word “otherwise” means “in a different way or manner,” “in different\\n\\ncircumstances,” or “in other respects.” Webster’s Third New International\\n\\nDictionary 1598 (3d ed. 2002); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1328 (11th ed.\\n\\n2019) (defining “otherwise” as “[i]n a different way; in another manner” or\\n\\n“[t]o the contrary; differently”).\\n\\n       Moreover, subsections (a) and (b) both explicitly require that the image\\n\\n“emit[] sensuality with sufficient impact to concentrate prurient interest on the\\n\\n                                        28\\n child.” Subsection (c) does not. Likewise, subsections (a) and (b) both\\n\\nexplicitly require that the depiction be of a child’s “intimate parts.” Not so for\\n\\nsubsection (c).\\n\\n      We agree with the ACDL that “[i]f the Legislature intended” the “emits\\n\\nsensuality with sufficient impact to concentrate prurient interest on the child”\\n\\nlanguage from subsection (a) “to carry over to each of the subsequent\\n\\nSubsections, there would have been no need for [the Legislature] to repeat that\\n\\nphrase in Subsection (b).” Instead, “[t]he fact that the Legislature repeated the\\n\\nlanguage in Subsection (b), but not Subsection (c), demonstrates that the\\n\\nLegislature did not seek to impose such a limit in Subsection (c).” The same is\\n\\ntrue for the requirement that the depiction be of a child’s “intimate parts.”\\n\\n      “[I]t is elementary that when the Legislature includes limiting language\\n\\nin one part of a statute, but leaves it out of another section in which the limit\\n\\ncould have been included, we infer that the omission was intentional.” Ryan v.\\n\\nRenny, \\n203 N.J. 37\\n, 58 (2010). Because the Legislature intentionally crafted\\n\\nsubsection (c) to be different from subsections (a) and (b), and to catch\\n\\ndepictions that are not encompassed within (a) and (b), we cannot heed the\\n\\nState’s request that we interpret subsection (c) only to reach “circumstances of\\n\\nthe same or like depictions as those enumerated in subsections (a) and (b).”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        29\\n       Neither Hoffman nor Paroline counsel otherwise. In Hoffman, we\\n\\ninterpreted N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a), which deems it harassment to “make[], or\\n\\ncause[] to be made, a communication or communications anonymously or at\\n\\nextremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other\\n\\nmanner likely to cause annoyance or alarm,” to “encompass only those types\\n\\nof communications that are . . . invasive of the recipient’s privacy.” \\n149 N.J.\\n\\nat 576, 583\\n (emphasis omitted). We held that the phrase “or any other manner\\n\\nlikely to cause annoyance or alarm” was a “catchall provision,” relying on the\\n\\nprincipal of statutory construction that “‘when general words follow specific\\n\\nwords in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace\\n\\nonly the objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding\\n\\nspecific words.’” \\nId. at 583-84\\n (quoting Hovbilt, Inc. v. Township of Howell,\\n\\n263 N.J. Super. 567\\n, 571 (App. Div. 1993)).\\n\\n      Similarly, in Paroline, the United States Supreme Court interpreted \\n18\\n\\nU.S.C. § 2259\\n. \\n572 U.S. at 439\\n. At the time, the statute contained the\\n\\nintroductory clause “[f]or purposes of this subsection the term ‘full amount of\\n\\nthe victim’s losses’ includes any costs incurred by the victim for,” and then\\n\\nlisted costs for: “(A) medical services . . . ; (B) physical and occupational\\n\\ntherapy . . . ; (C) necessary transportation, temporary housing, and child care\\n\\nexpenses; (D) lost income; (E) attorneys’ fees . . . ; and (F) any other losses\\n\\n                                        30\\n suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense.” \\n18 U.S.C. § 2259\\n\\n\\n(2014) (emphasis added). The court held that (F) was “most naturally\\n\\nunderstood as a summary of the type of losses covered -- i.e., losses suffered\\n\\nas a proximate result of the offense.” Paroline, \\n572 U.S. at 447\\n (emphasis\\n\\nadded).\\n\\n      Here, we are not dealing with one statutory subsection that includes\\n\\nspecific examples of types of communications or types of costs followed by a\\n\\ngeneral summary or catch-all phrase. Instead, as the State correctly argues in\\n\\nits brief, the Legislature defined the phrase “portray a child in a sexually\\n\\nsuggestive manner” “through three disjunctive statutory subsections, which\\n\\nprovide separate and distinct categories of proscribed material.” Each of the\\n\\nthree disjunctive subsections, the State acknowledges, is separated by the word\\n\\n“or” and provides a “distinct scenario under which an item depicts the\\n\\nsexualization of a child.”\\n\\n      Because of the textual differences between subsections (a), (b), and (c)\\n\\ndiscussed above, the relevant part of Hoffman is not the one cited by the State,\\n\\nbut a discussion several pages earlier in that opinion. In addition to deeming\\n\\ncertain communications harassment, the statute at issue in that case, in two\\n\\nadditional subsections, deemed certain types of offensive touching and courses\\n\\nof alarming conduct to be harassment. N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a), (b), and (c).\\n\\n                                        31\\n While the communications only had to “cause annoyance or alarm” to qualify\\n\\nas harassment, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a) (emphasis added), the course of alarming\\n\\nconduct had to be “with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy such other\\n\\nperson,” N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(c) (emphasis added).\\n\\n        We refused to “engraft[] the term ‘serious’ found in subsection (c) into\\n\\nsubsection (a) because the Legislature carefully employed it in subsection (c)\\n\\nand excluded it in subsection (a), thereby indicating that the exclusion was\\n\\nintentional.” Hoffman, \\n149 N.J. at\\n579 (citing N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4(a) and (c)).\\n\\nThe same is true here. “[F]amiliar principle[s] of statutory construction\\n\\npreclude[]” us from importing the language of subsections (a) and (b) into\\n\\nsubsection (c) where the Legislature made the conscious choice not to do so.\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n        Although we “construe a challenged statute to avoid constitutional\\n\\ndefects if the statute is reasonably susceptible” to such a construction,\\n\\nLenihan, \\n219 N.J. at 266\\n (quotation omitted), subsection (c) is not reasonably\\n\\nsusceptible to the State’s limiting construction. Mindful that “it is not our\\n\\nfunction to ‘re-write a plainly written enactment,’” J.H. v. R&M Tagliareni,\\n\\nLLC, \\n239 N.J. 198\\n, 214 (2019) (quoting U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Hough, \\n210 N.J.\\n\\n187\\n, 199 (2012)), we reject the State’s interpretation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        32\\n       We also reject the State’s claim that “everything that subsection (c)\\n\\ncovers . . . fits within” the Supreme Court’s most recent definition of child\\n\\npornography in Williams, which the State contends clarifies that child\\n\\npornography “clearly does not require actual participation by [a] child.” At\\n\\nissue in Williams was a federal statute that criminalized “offers to provide and\\n\\nrequests to obtain child pornography,” defined as “obscene visual depiction[s]\\n\\nof a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct” and “visual depiction[s] of\\n\\nan actual minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.” \\n553 U.S. at 289-90,\\n\\n293\\n (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(3)(B)). Sexually explicit conduct was\\n\\ndefined as “actual or simulated . . . (i) sexual intercourse. . . (ii) bestiality;\\n\\n(iii) masturbation; (iv) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or (v) lascivious\\n\\nexhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.” Id. at 290 (quoting \\n18\\n\\nU.S.C. § 2256\\n(2)(A)).\\n\\n      The Supreme Court concluded that the statute’s definition of prohibited\\n\\nmaterial “precisely tracks the material held constitutionally proscribable in\\n\\nFerber and Miller,” \\nid. at 293\\n, but not in the way the State suggests. Instead,\\n\\nthe Supreme Court held that the statute proscribed “obscene material depicting\\n\\n(actual or virtual) children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and any other\\n\\nmaterial depicting actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          33\\n       Subsection (c) proscribes far more than obscene material depicting\\n\\nvirtual children engaged in what the federal statute defines as sexually explicit\\n\\nconduct, or any material depicting actual children engaged in such conduct.\\n\\nWilliams therefore does not help the State.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      Because we hold that subsection (c) is substantially overbroad, we do\\n\\nnot reach the question of vagueness.\\n\\n      We also do not reach the validity of subsections (a) or (b). Defendant\\n\\nwas not charged under subsections (a) or (b). He did not challenge subsections\\n\\n(a) or (b) before the trial court or the Appellate Division. And subsection (c)\\n\\nis plainly severable from subsections (a) and (b).\\n\\n      We agree with the State that subsections (a), (b), and (c) are disjunctive\\n\\nsubsections that each set forth separate and distinct definitions for materials\\n\\nthat “portray a child in a sexually suggestive manner.” N.J.S.A. 2C:24-\\n\\n4(b)(1). Subsections (a) and (b) are independent of subsection (c), do not\\n\\ndepend on subsection (c) for their meaning, and can stand on their own without\\n\\nsubsection (c). There is no indication that the Legislature “designed” that\\n\\nsubsections (a), (b), and (c) should “stand or fall as a unitary whole.” Brady v.\\n\\nN.J. Redistricting Comm’n, \\n131 N.J. 594\\n, 606-07 (1992) (quoting State v.\\n\\nLanza, \\n27 N.J. 516\\n, 527-28 (1958)).\\n\\n                                        34\\n       Because subsection (c) can be excised without impacting subsections (a)\\n\\nor (b), we hold that subsection (c) -- and subsection (c) alone -- of the\\n\\ndefinition of “portray a child in a sexually suggestive manner” contained in\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(b)(1) is unconstitutional. See Township of Mahwah v.\\n\\nBergen Cnty. Bd. of Tax’n, \\n98 N.J. 268\\n, 294 (1985); In re Adoption of\\n\\nN.J.A.C. 5:96, \\n215 N.J. 578\\n, 617 (2013).\\n\\n      We add a few additional comments. We agree with the State that it has a\\n\\n“compelling interest in protecting children not only from sexual and physical\\n\\nabuse, but also from severe emotional, psychological, and reputational harm.”\\n\\nWe also agree that “an image that associates a child with explicit sexual\\n\\ncontent . . . can haunt the child for years.” This decision does not opine on the\\n\\nState’s ability to protect children from such harms. It simply holds that in\\n\\ncriminalizing a wide swath of material that is neither obscenity nor child\\n\\npornography, subsection (c) is substantially overbroad. 8\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n  In one of its briefs, the State contends that “any applications that are not\\ncovered by the child pornography exception” to the First Amendment are\\ncovered by other First Amendment exceptions, including “obscenity,\\ndefamation, [intentional infliction of emotional distress,] public disclosure of\\nprivate facts, and/or speech integral to criminal conduct.” We explained in\\ndetail above why subsection (c) does not criminalize only obscenity. The State\\nprovides no argument as to how subsection (c) could criminalize defamation,\\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, public disclosure of private facts,\\nor speech integral to criminal conduct. We therefore do not address those\\nexceptions.\\n                                         35\\n       Similarly, we agree with the State that defendant “enjoys no First\\n\\nAmendment right” to combine pictures of Christine with obscene language and\\n\\ndistribute them over the Internet. Defendant agrees with this point as well. He\\n\\nexpressly concedes that he “could be prosecuted under New Jersey’s obscenity\\n\\nstatute.” While defendant can be constitutionally prosecuted under New\\n\\nJersey’s obscenity law, he cannot be prosecuted under a different law that is\\n\\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\\n\\n                                       V.\\n\\n      The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed as modified, and the\\n\\nmatter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with\\n\\nthis opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n    CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE WAINER\\nAPTER’s opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       36\\n '),\n",

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\nComprehensive Neurosurgical, P.C. v. The Valley Hospital (A-52-22) (087469)\\n\\nArgued November 29, 2023 -- Decided April 16, 2024\\n\\nFASCIALE, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       The Court considers The Valley Hospital’s challenge to a jury verdict in favor\\nof a group of eleven neurosurgeons and their practice group, Comprehensive\\nNeurosurgical, P.C. (collectively, plaintiffs). A jury awarded plaintiffs $24,300,000\\nin damages based on their claim that Valley did not deal with them fairly or act in\\ngood faith when it granted another group of neurosurgeons exclusive privileges in\\nareas for which plaintiffs had held privileges.\\n\\n        Plaintiffs joined Valley’s medical staff in 2003. Over the years, they\\nexpanded their group, and they helped grow Valley’s neurosurgical programs and\\nfacilities as well. In addition to holding core hospital and admitting privileges,\\nplaintiffs were given the right to “cover” the Emergency Room (ER) by treating\\n“unassigned” ER patients who arrive to the ER on an emergency basis and are not\\nany other neurosurgeon’s established patient. Plaintiffs’ practice at Valley primarily\\nderived from treating those “unassigned” ER patients. Plaintiffs also received\\n“specialized privileges” authorizing them to use the “Biplane” and “Gamma Knife”\\nequipment they helped implement.\\n\\n       When a new hospital opened six miles from Valley in 2013, plaintiffs obtained\\nprivileges there as well. In 2015, Valley granted a different group of neurosurgeons\\nexclusive rights to use the “Biplane” and “Gamma Knife” equipment and to treat\\n“unassigned” ER patients, thereby revoking plaintiffs’ privileges in those areas.\\nPlaintiffs allege that grant of exclusive rights was not a valid administrative\\nhealthcare decision, but rather a form of retaliation for their perceived disloyalty in\\njoining the new hospital. Valley alleges that the decision was valid in part because\\nplaintiffs were diverting patients from Valley to the new hospital.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Valley. Following summary judgment\\nmotions, two claims reached the jury: (1) a breach of contract claim seeking money\\ndamages, in which plaintiffs alleged that Valley had breached its Medical Staff\\nBylaws (the Bylaws) by failing to provide plaintiffs with a hearing; and (2)\\nplaintiffs’ breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, for\\n                                          1\\n which they also sought money damages. The trial court determined that plaintiffs’\\nchallenge to Valley’s grant of exclusive privileges as an invalid administrative\\ndetermination was “subsumed” within the implied covenant claim because the “same\\narguments” could be used for both.\\n\\n       At trial, plaintiffs presented emails from Valley’s general counsel turned over\\nby Valley during the discovery process. Prior to discovery, the parties agreed that\\nany inadvertent disclosures could be “clawed back,” and Valley attempted to “claw\\nback” the emails from counsel, asserting that they were protected by the attorney-\\nclient privilege. Plaintiffs’ counsel also stressed in summation that Valley had\\npresented little evidence that plaintiffs had diverted patients from Valley to the new\\nhospital. Counsel made that argument despite knowing that materials plaintiffs had\\nsubmitted in discovery showed sixty cases of patient transfers that were excluded\\nfrom admission because Valley learned of them only after granting exclusive rights\\nto the other neurosurgery group. The jury ultimately found no cause of action on the\\nbreach of contract claim based on the lack of a hearing, but it awarded damages\\nbased on the breach of implied covenant claim.\\n\\n       Valley appealed, and the Appellate Division affirmed both the denial of\\nsummary judgment and the jury’s verdict. Valley petitioned for certification,\\narguing that summary judgment should have been granted in its favor because courts\\ntraditionally defer to hospitals’ administrative healthcare policy decisions that\\n“genuinely serve[] a legitimate public-health objective,” Berman v. Valley Hospital,\\n103 N.J. 100\\n, 107 (1986), “including the selection of [its] medical staff,” Desai v. St.\\nBarnabas Medical Center, \\n103 N.J. 79\\n, 90 (1986). Valley argues in the alternative\\nthat substantial cumulative errors tainting the jury verdict require a new trial.\\nAccording to Valley, the jury was improperly permitted -- through an unclear verdict\\nsheet and instructions -- to find that Valley had breached an implied covenant of\\ngood faith and fair dealing. Valley also contends that the jury verdict was tainted by\\nthe erroneous admission into evidence of privileged emails and by the misleading\\nremarks plaintiffs’ attorney made in summation. The Court granted certification.\\n254 N.J. 210\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Plaintiffs’ good faith and fair dealing claim properly survived summary\\njudgment, but the jury was not correctly charged or asked to rule on that claim. The\\ntrial judge failed to instruct the jury that the only underlying contract to which the\\nimplied covenant could attach to had to be one beyond the rights afforded by the\\nBylaws. Adding to the significant uncertainty created by the jury charge and verdict\\nsheet are the improper admission into evidence of the privileged emails and the\\nimproper remarks by plaintiffs’ attorney. Those errors, cumulatively, had the\\ncapacity to lead the jury to reach a verdict it would not have otherwise reached and\\nthus deprived Valley of a fair trial.\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n 1. A claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implied\\nby law into every contract requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant’s\\nalleged misdeeds prevented the plaintiff from enjoying the full benefit of a particular\\nbargain. Although medical staff bylaws impose reciprocal legal obligations and\\nrights between those who agreed to be bound, those obligations do not give rise to a\\ntraditional contract, to a claim for the traditional contract remedy of damages, or to a\\nseparate breach of the implied covenant claim. Instead, when a hospital violates its\\nmedical staff bylaws, equitable relief may be available. Thus, plaintiffs here would\\nhave been entitled to a hearing if Valley had violated the Bylaws by failing to\\nprovide one in the first place; the jury, however, expressly found that Valley did not\\nviolate the Bylaws. The Bylaws cannot constitute the underlying contract for\\npurposes of plaintiffs’ separate breach of the implied covenant claim. (pp. 28-34)\\n\\n2. Just as the Bylaws here offer no ground for a breach of an implied covenant of\\ngood faith and fair dealing claim, Valley’s administrative healthcare decision to\\naward exclusive privileges to a particular group cannot on its own give rise to a\\nclaim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. A hospital\\nmay not act in bad faith and simultaneously serve a “genuine” healthcare objective\\nbased on “reasonable and reliable” information. See Desai, \\n103 N.J. at 91-93\\n.\\nPhysicians who are adversely affected by a hospital’s administrative healthcare\\ndecision may challenge that decision by arguing that it was not made in accordance\\nwith the standard set forth in Desai. Here, however, the trial judge concluded that\\nplaintiffs’ challenge to the Valley’s grant of exclusive privileges was “subsumed”\\nwith their implied covenant claim. As a result, the legal principles related to\\nValley’s administrative decision became relevant only as to its defense to the implied\\ncovenant claim, and not as an asserted basis for money damages. (pp. 34-38)\\n\\n3. The final basis advanced in the course of this litigation for finding that Valley\\nwas bound to act in good faith and deal fairly with plaintiffs is an alleged implied\\ncontract between the parties, one that goes “beyond the Bylaws.” Plaintiffs allege\\nthat, from Valley’s initial offer to join and collaboratively build Valley’s\\nneuroscience department and from the parties’ course of dealings since plaintiffs\\njoined, it can be reasonably inferred that an implied contract existed between\\nplaintiffs and Valley that would allegedly support their expectation to indefinitely\\nmaintain their privileges and rights absent a valid administrative healthcare decision\\nproviding otherwise. In the event that plaintiffs could demonstrate that all the\\nfundamental elements of contract formation had been established, their theory of an\\nagreement beyond the rights afforded by the Bylaws would be contractual in nature.\\nAmong the three possible sources to support plaintiffs’ claim here -- the Bylaws,\\nValley’s administrative healthcare decision, and the alleged implied-in-fact contract\\nbetween plaintiffs and Valley -- the only alleged source of mutual obligation to\\nwhich the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing could properly attach to is\\nthe implied-in-fact contract. (pp. 38-41)\\n                                           3\\n 4. The Court explains how the evidence in the record, taken in the light most\\nfavorable to plaintiffs, was sufficient to raise a factual dispute as to whether there\\nwas an implied-in-fact contract between plaintiffs and Valley and whether Valley\\nacted in bad faith in revoking certain of plaintiffs’ privileges, such that the claim\\nproperly survived summary judgment. Although the claim properly reached the jury,\\nhowever, the jury charge and verdict sheet did not properly instruct the jurors on the\\nelements of the claim. Notably, the jury was given no law on how to measure\\nValley’s defense to the implied covenant claim, and consideration of the jury charge\\nas a whole raises significant doubt as to whether the jury found the underlying\\ncontract for plaintiffs’ implied covenant claim to be some implied or oral agreement\\nbeyond the Bylaws, or just the Bylaws. The jury could have come to a different\\nresult had it been correctly instructed on the contract claims, especially because the\\nunderlying contract on the implied covenant claim -- purportedly an endless right to\\ntreat “unassigned” ER patients with special tools -- was not in writing. (pp. 41-52)\\n\\n5. The emails between Valley and its general counsel for the purpose of legal\\nadvice, rather than business purposes, are protected by the attorney-client privilege.\\nValley did not place its general counsel’s pre-litigation legal advice “in-issue,” nor\\ndid it call its general counsel as a witness. Valley’s inadvertent disclosure of the\\nemails -- allegedly consisting of 352 pages -- in the course of an exchange of about\\n57,000 documents in roughly two months did not amount to waiver of the attorney-\\nclient privilege. The parties’ discovery agreement’s claw-back provision anticipated\\nprecisely such an inadvertence. And admission of the emails into evidence was not\\nharmless. Select emails in many ways became the centerpiece of plaintiffs’ case.\\nOn remand, if plaintiffs attempt to introduce emails from the batch Valley attempted\\nto claw back, the judge should conduct a document-by-document review to\\ndetermine whether the emails are privileged and thus not admissible. (pp. 52-58)\\n\\n6. Certain comments by plaintiffs’ trial counsel in summation were improper.\\nPlaintiffs’ trial counsel knew that Valley had evidence of sixty cases of patient\\ntransfers. The summation remarks implied, however, that there was evidence of only\\ntwo cases of patient transfers, and that inaccurate statement impacted Valley’s\\ncontention that it made a valid healthcare decision. (pp. 58-61)\\n\\n7. The cumulative errors here deprived Valley of a fair trial and warrant a new one.\\nThe Court sets forth specific guidance for the remand proceedings. (pp. 61-62)\\n\\n      REVERSED.

A jury awarded plaintiffs $24,300,000 in damages\\n\\nbased on their claim that Valley did not deal with them fairly or act in good\\n\\nfaith when it granted another group of neurosurgeons exclusive privileges in\\n\\nareas for which plaintiffs had held privileges.\\n\\n      Valley first argues that the trial judge should have granted summary\\n\\njudgment in its favor because courts traditionally defer to hospitals’\\n\\nadministrative healthcare policy decisions that “genuinely serve[] a legitimate\\n\\npublic-health objective,” Berman v. Valley Hospital, \\n103 N.J. 100\\n, 107 (1986),\\n\\n“including the selection of [its] medical staff,” Desai v. St. Barnabas Medical\\n\\nCenter, \\n103 N.J. 79\\n, 90 (1986). Valley argues in the alternative that\\n\\nsubstantial cumulative errors tainting the jury verdict require a new trial.\\n\\nAccording to Valley, the jury was improperly permitted -- through an unclear\\n\\nverdict sheet and instructions -- to find that Valley had breached an implied\\n\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing. Valley also contends that the jury\\n\\nverdict was tainted by the erroneous admission into evidence of privileged\\n\\n\\n                                        3\\n emails and by misleading remarks that plaintiffs’ attorney made in summation\\n\\nwhen he emphasized Valley’s lack of evidence on an issue despite knowing\\n\\nthat such evidence existed.\\n\\n      Although we find that plaintiffs’ good faith and fair dealing claim\\n\\nproperly survived summary judgment, we agree that the jury was not correctly\\n\\ncharged or asked to rule on that claim. The trial judge failed to instruct the\\n\\njury that the only underlying contract to which the implied covenant could\\n\\nattach to had to be one beyond the rights afforded by Valley’s Medical Staff\\n\\nBylaws (the Bylaws). Adding to the significant uncertainty created by the jury\\n\\ncharge and verdict sheet are the improper admission into evidence of the\\n\\nprivileged emails and the improper remarks by plaintiffs’ attorney.\\n\\n      Despite the deference with which we consider jury verdicts, we find that\\n\\nthose errors, cumulatively, had the capacity to lead the jury to reach a verdict\\n\\nit would not have otherwise reached and deprived Valley of a fair trial.\\n\\nAccordingly, we reverse the appellate court’s judgment, vacate that part of the\\n\\nverdict on plaintiffs’ implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim,\\n\\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n      We derive the factual overview that follows from the evidence and\\n\\ntestimony presented at trial. Mindful that a substantial retrial will follow our\\n\\n                                        4\\n decision, we endeavor to attribute differing accounts to the parties that made\\n\\nthem, and also emphasize that no factual findings may be inferred from the\\n\\noverview presented here.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs -- initially a group of two neurosurgeons -- joined the Valley\\n\\nHospital Medical Staff Organization (Medical Staff) in 2003. 1 Upon arrival,\\n\\nplaintiffs received “core privileges” allowing them to perform common\\n\\nneurosurgery procedures, and “admitting privileges” permitting them to admit\\n\\ntheir already-established patients into Valley. Valley also gave plaintiffs the\\n\\nright to “cover” the Emergency Room (ER) by treating “unassigned” ER\\n\\npatients who arrive to the ER on an emergency basis and are not any other\\n\\nneurosurgeon’s established patient. Plaintiffs’ practice at Valley primarily\\n\\nderived from treating those “unassigned” ER patients.\\n\\n      Over the following years, plaintiffs expanded their practice from two to\\n\\nup to twelve neurosurgeons. Additional neurosurgeons and practice groups\\n\\nalso obtained privileges and joined the Medical Staff. For example, Dr.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Valley’s Medical Staff is an organization “responsible to the governing body\\nof the hospital.” See N.J.A.C. 8:43G-16.1 (titled “Medical staff structural\\norganization”).\\n                                       5\\n Anthony D’Ambrosio of the Columbia Neurosurgical Network-NJ (the\\n\\nColumbia Group) joined the Medical Staff in July 2007.2\\n\\n      With plaintiffs’ help, Valley’s programs and facilities grew during that time\\n\\nas well. Plaintiffs helped establish Valley’s “Spine Center,” contributed to the\\n\\ncreation of Valley’s “Neuro-oncology program,” and introduced specialized\\n\\nneurosurgical equipment, such as the “Biplane” angiography system and the\\n\\n“Gamma Knife” radiosurgery procedure, which allowed the neurosurgeons to\\n\\nperform minimally invasive surgeries rather than “opening” patients’ skulls.\\n\\nValley granted “specialized privileges” to the physicians in plaintiffs’ practice\\n\\ngroup who focused their craft on treating stroke and aneurysm patients. The\\n\\n“specialized privileges” authorized them to use the “Biplane” and “Gamma\\n\\nKnife” equipment they helped implement. 3\\n\\n      By 2008, Valley had opened its “Neuroscience Center of Excellence,”\\n\\nwhich included a “Comprehensive Stroke Center.” According to testimony by\\n\\na Valley executive, Valley sought to enhance its programs further by creating a\\n\\n\\n2\\n The record does not clearly reflect whether other physicians in the Columbia\\nGroup joined at the same time as Dr. D’Ambrosio. Further, a solo practitioner,\\nDr. Duncan Carpenter, and a third practice group, Bergen Passaic\\nNeurosurgery, also joined Valley at some point prior to 2015.\\n3\\n  The record is unclear as to how many members of plaintiffs’ practice group\\nwere granted “specialized privileges” for those devices and how many\\nadditional surgeons were granted the same privileges.\\n\\n                                         6\\n “Neuroscience Strategic Planning Committee” tasked with “implementing\\n\\nalignment strategies” between Valley and the neurosurgeons on the Medical\\n\\nStaff. One such “alignment strategy” included a possible co-management\\n\\nagreement. 4 The Valley executive testified that the Columbia Group was\\n\\n“pretty excited” about the possibility of a co-management structure while\\n\\nplaintiffs’ group “was skeptical.”\\n\\n      Meanwhile, six miles down the road from Valley, Hackensack\\n\\nUniversity Medical Center took over a hospital that had previously closed and\\n\\nbegan the process of reopening it as “Hackensack University Medical Center at\\n\\nPascack Valley” (Hackensack). Valley launched several attempts to prevent\\n\\nthat reopening, including a lawsuit where it relied principally on N.J.S.A.\\n\\n26:2H-8 to argue there was no “need” to open a new medical facility in the\\n\\narea. Valley ultimately lost that suit on appeal, and Hackensack opened\\n\\naround June 2013. Hackensack thereafter granted plaintiffs privileges to treat\\n\\npatients at Hackensack. In a meeting with plaintiffs, Valley’s President and\\n\\nCEO, Audrey Meyers, expressed that she disliked how plaintiffs\\n\\nsimultaneously held privileges and leadership positions at both Valley and\\n\\nHackensack.\\n\\n\\n4\\n  Generally, a co-management agreement is an agreement between hospitals\\nand physicians to align with one another and to work with each other toward\\ncommon goals.\\n                                       7\\n       According to Valley, its satisfaction with plaintiffs’ performance\\n\\ndeteriorated over time, exacerbated by concerns over plaintiffs’ relationship\\n\\nwith Hackensack. In 2014, Valley’s Vice President of Planning and\\n\\nGovernment Relations, Gail Callandrillo, along with Valley’s data analysis\\n\\nteam and one independent consultant, evaluated Valley’s neurosurgical\\n\\nservices. Specifically, they compared “data relating to volume, quality,\\n\\nutilization and complication rates” between patients cared for by the Columbia\\n\\nGroup and plaintiffs. That analysis served as the basis for a study authored by\\n\\nCallandrillo and outside counsel, which the parties have called the “White\\n\\nPaper.”\\n\\n      Valley’s White Paper stated that plaintiffs had lower inpatient and\\n\\noutpatient volumes, performed fewer neurosurgery procedures at Valley,\\n\\nmaintained a higher leakage rate, 5 and overall rendered a lower quality of\\n\\npatient care than did the Columbia Group. The White Paper also suggested\\n\\nthat plaintiffs had engaged in so-called “patient transfers,” which involved\\n\\n“accruing patients from [Valley’s] Emergency Department consult and\\n\\nsubsequently performing [] procedures at another facility, presumably\\n\\n[Hackensack] given their strong connection to that organization.” After\\n\\n\\n5\\n  “Leakage” is a term used to describe when a hospital’s patient obtains\\nhealthcare outside the hospital network. One consequence of leakage is loss of\\nrevenue.\\n                                       8\\n ultimately concluding that the Columbia Group outperformed plaintiffs, the\\n\\nWhite Paper recommended that Valley enter into an exclusive agreement with\\n\\nthe Columbia Group (the Exclusive Agreement).\\n\\n      Meyers and the Staff Development Committee of the Valley Board of\\n\\nTrustees then presented the White Paper to the entire Valley Board of\\n\\nTrustees, recommending that Valley enter into the Exclusive Agreement. The\\n\\nBoard agreed, and in December 2015, Valley and the Columbia Group signed\\n\\nthe Exclusive Agreement providing the Columbia Group with the exclusive\\n\\nright over Valley’s “unassigned” ER patients, as well as exclusive access to\\n\\nthe “Gamma Knife” and “Biplane” equipment.\\n\\n      Thereafter, Meyers notified plaintiffs about the Exclusive Agreement.\\n\\nShe explained that the Columbia Group was given exclusive rights to Valley’s\\n\\n“unassigned” ER patients but that plaintiffs were still permitted to admit and\\n\\ntreat their established patients. Plaintiffs demanded Valley “immediately\\n\\nrevoke” the Exclusive Agreement and asserted that its practical effect revoked\\n\\ntheir privileges. Plaintiff Patrick Roth testified that being cut off from treating\\n\\n“unassigned” ER patients meant that plaintiffs’ practice was “dead in the\\n\\nwater” because “all strokes are emergency by definition” and therefore most\\n\\nstroke patients are “unassigned.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         9\\n       The parties dispute whether plaintiffs complied with the procedural\\n\\nrequirements for requesting a hearing in accordance with the Bylaws. Those\\n\\nBylaws, initially approved by Valley’s governing body in 1984 and amended\\n\\ntwenty-seven times since, govern procedures for physician appointment and\\n\\nreappointment, set physician qualifications, provide for the conferral of\\n\\nhospital privileges, and afford certain procedural rights, including a hearing\\n\\nunder certain circumstances. As relevant here, if promptly requested in\\n\\nwriting, Medical Staff members may be entitled to a hearing under the Bylaws\\n\\nupon receipt of a “notice of a corrective action . . . which if ratified . . . would\\n\\nadversely affect the [member’s] appointment, reappointment to the Medical\\n\\nStaff, or clinical privileges on the Medical Staff.” (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Without conducting a hearing, Valley responded that its actions did not\\n\\nconstitute a revocation of plaintiffs’ privileges and refused to “immediately\\n\\nrevoke” the Exclusive Agreement.\\n\\n                                         II.\\n\\n                                         A.\\n\\n      In late January 2016, plaintiffs filed a verified complaint and order to\\n\\nshow cause (OTSC) in the Chancery Division. Plaintiffs alleged that\\n\\n             [t]he Valley Defendants have unilaterally sought to\\n             terminate the rights and Medical Staff privileges of\\n             [plaintiffs] for entirely improper reasons, including:\\n             (1) [Meyers] sought to punish perceived disloyalty\\n                                         10\\n             because [plaintiffs] professionally associated with\\n            Meyers’ rival at Hackensack University Medical\\n            Center; and (2) to enforce Meyers’ demand to exclude\\n            Medicaid and similar financially distressed patients\\n            from Valley Hospital. To accomplish this wrongful\\n            objective, they determined to push out [plaintiffs] by\\n            contracting with [the Columbia Group] to exclusively\\n            perform nearly all of the procedures [plaintiffs] have\\n            developed at Valley. Not only were the Valley\\n            Defendants motivated by illegal purposes -- in flagrant\\n            disregard of this state’s public policy, which requires\\n            that hospital’s actions further legitimate patient-care\\n            needs -- but the Valley Defendants also concocted an\\n            illegal scheme to deny [plaintiffs] even the right to be\\n            heard before their privileges are terminated, as required\\n            by the [Bylaws].\\n\\nIn the Chancery Division, plaintiffs sought to enjoin Valley from allegedly\\n\\nterminating their hospital privileges and from restricting their ability to treat\\n\\n“unassigned” ER patients.\\n\\n      On the initial return date of the OTSC, the chancery judge did not enter\\n\\nrestraints and instead temporarily retained jurisdiction over the entire matter\\n\\nwhile the parties conducted expedited discovery. The parties jointly consented\\n\\nto a protective order enabling either party, if necessary, to “claw back” any\\n\\ndocuments that might be inadvertently produced. Over the next approximate\\n\\ntwo months of discovery, the parties exchanged over 57,000 documents. Two\\n\\nsignificant events transpired during the exchange of discovery.\\n\\n      The first involved a set of emails that Valley produced. Valley invoked\\n\\nthe protective order to “claw back” emails it claimed to have inadvertently\\n                                        11\\n produced. Valley contended that the emails contained legal advice from\\n\\nValley’s general counsel, Robin Goldfischer, including suggestions about how\\n\\nto provide proper documentary support for the hospital’s decision to enter into\\n\\nthe Exclusive Agreement.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs refused to return the requested emails and instead filed a\\n\\nmotion seeking to retain them. The chancery judge reviewed the emails in-\\n\\ncamera and concluded that they were protected by the attorney-client privilege.\\n\\nThe judge determined, however, that Valley waived the privilege by placing\\n\\nthe White Paper “in-issue” and by disclosing the emails in discovery. Despite\\n\\nnoting that plaintiffs could access the information in the emails “in a less\\n\\nintrusive manner,” the judge granted plaintiffs’ motion and allowed them to\\n\\nkeep the emails.\\n\\n      The second significant result of discovery was that Valley found\\n\\nevidence tending to support its suspicion that plaintiffs were engaging in\\n\\npatient transfers. Documents produced by plaintiffs revealed that sixty cases\\n\\nof patient transfers occurred between 2012 and 2014, tending to support what\\n\\nthe White Paper suggested was occurring.\\n\\n      The chancery judge denied plaintiffs’ application for a permanent\\n\\ninjunction and transferred the case to the Law Division. Valley later\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       12\\n unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the order permitting plaintiffs to keep\\n\\nthe emails.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n                                       1.\\n\\n      In the Law Division, plaintiffs amended the complaint that they filed in\\n\\nthe Chancery Division. In their amended pleading, they alleged that Valley\\n\\n(1) engaged in an invalid exercise of its discretionary healthcare powers (the\\n\\n“Berman” claim); (2) violated the doctrine of fundamental fairness;\\n\\n(3) breached the Bylaws by failing to provide a hearing (the purported “breach\\n\\nof contract” claim); (4) breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair\\n\\ndealing; (5) tortiously interfered with prospective economic benefit; and\\n\\n(6) committed trade libel. 6\\n\\n      The parties then moved for summary judgment. The trial judge denied\\n\\nthose motions, finding that there existed genuine issues of material fact,\\n\\nprimarily pertaining to whether Valley properly terminated plaintiffs’\\n\\nprivileges.\\n\\n\\n6\\n  Plaintiffs also named the Board of Trustees of the Valley Hospital, Meyers,\\nthe Columbia Group (now called Neurosurgical Associates of New Jersey,\\nP.C.), and Dr. D’Ambrosio as co-defendants. Plaintiffs’ claims against the\\nColumbia Group and Dr. D’Ambrosio included allegations that they tortiously\\ninterfered with prospective economic advantage and tortiously interfered with\\na contract. All claims against the named co-defendants were dismissed on\\nsummary judgment.\\n                                      13\\n       Two claims reached the jury: (1) a breach of contract claim seeking\\n\\nmoney damages, in which plaintiffs alleged that Valley had breached the\\n\\nBylaws by failing to provide them with a hearing; and (2) plaintiffs’ breach of\\n\\nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, for which they also\\n\\nsought money damages. The trial judge determined that plaintiffs’ challenge\\n\\nto Valley’s decision to enter into the Exclusive Agreement -- i.e., the\\n\\n“Berman” claim -- was “subsumed” within the implied covenant claim because\\n\\nthe “same arguments” could be used for both. He therefore treated the Berman\\n\\nclaim and the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\\n\\nclaim as a single count. All other claims were dismissed.\\n\\n                                       2.\\n\\n      During the trial, plaintiffs presented arguments about Valley’s alleged\\n\\nbreach of the Bylaws as well as the alleged impropriety of Valley’s\\n\\nadministrative healthcare decision. Specifically, plaintiffs argued that Valley’s\\n\\ndecision to enter into the Exclusive Agreement was a spiteful rebuke for\\n\\nplaintiffs’ relationship with Hackensack. According to plaintiffs, the White\\n\\nPaper was not forward-looking research designed to assess Valley’s status and\\n\\nto determine what changes would best allow Valley’s neuroscience department\\n\\nto meet the needs of the public. Instead, plaintiffs claimed the White Paper\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       14\\n was a “sham” document prepared to justify, retroactively, Valley’s decision to\\n\\npunish plaintiffs because of perceived disloyalty to Valley.\\n\\n        Plaintiffs also presented testimony and evidence supporting the mutual\\n\\nobligations that plaintiffs alleged that they and Valley had agreed to.\\n\\nAccording to plaintiffs, those obligations arose from (1) Valley’s persuasion\\n\\nand encouragement of plaintiffs to join the Medical Staff at a time when its\\n\\nneuroscience department was relatively undeveloped; (2) plaintiffs’ agreement\\n\\nto join the Medical Staff believing that Valley wanted plaintiffs to help\\n\\ntransform the hospital into a “Neuroscience Center of Excellence”; and (3)\\n\\nplaintiffs’ continuing efforts to meet Valley’s goals, which included research,\\n\\ntravel, and applying for State funding support. Dr. Roth testified at trial that in\\n\\nreturn, plaintiffs expected to run Valley’s ER “forever”; he explained to the\\n\\njury:\\n\\n              I looked at [Valley’s request] as a quid pro quo,\\n              meaning you know, we’re going to build this [ER],\\n              we’re going to modernize it, we’re going to stop this\\n              flow of patients from outside [Valley] to [other\\n              hospitals] and . . . we’re going to do a great job of\\n              manning [the ER] and . . . in return it’s ours to lose.\\n\\n        Valley opposed the breach of contract claim, arguing that it was not\\n\\nrequired to grant a hearing under the Bylaws. On plaintiffs’ breach of the\\n\\nimplied covenant claim, Valley denied that the Bylaws would somehow\\n\\n\\n                                        15\\n guarantee plaintiffs privileges in perpetuity, regardless of the best interests of\\n\\nthe hospital or the public. Moreover, Valley defended its decision to enter into\\n\\nthe Exclusive Agreement as a valid exercise of hospital administrative\\n\\ndiscretion -- due deference under Berman and Desai -- based on an analysis of\\n\\npatients’ needs and of the practice groups’ respective performances.\\n\\n      In developing its defense, Valley attempted to show that its concerns\\n\\nabout plaintiffs diverting patients from Valley to Hackensack were grounded\\n\\nin reality rather than animus. Valley therefore attempted to question a witness\\n\\nabout the transfers of patients to Hackensack. Plaintiffs’ counsel objected to\\n\\nthat line of questioning, arguing that Valley’s current knowledge of the\\n\\ntransfers -- derived during discovery -- is “irrelevant” to prove that it acted in\\n\\ngood faith back when it entered into the Exclusive Agreement years before.\\n\\nThe trial judge sustained plaintiffs’ objection. Valley’s counsel then requested\\n\\nthat plaintiffs “be precluded from arguing [that the transfers] didn’t happen.”\\n\\nThe transcript reflects that the trial judge did not respond to that request.\\n\\n      In summation, plaintiffs’ counsel attempted to discredit Valley’s\\n\\nargument about the patient transfers by noting that Valley only mentioned two\\n\\nsuch instances. Plaintiffs’ counsel then went on to ask the jury: “[D]o you\\n\\nthink that if there were more, [Valley] would have presented them to us? Do\\n\\nyou think if they existed, they would have found their way into the [White\\n\\n                                        16\\n Paper]?” (emphases added). Valley did not object to the comments. The\\n\\nsummation transcript also reveals that plaintiffs’ counsel referred to the\\n\\nprivileged emails at least three times during summation.\\n\\n                                         3.\\n\\n        During the jury charge conference, there was considerable debate among\\n\\nthe parties and the trial judge about how to instruct the jury on contract\\n\\nformation when medical staff bylaws are involved. Plaintiffs asked that the\\n\\njury be instructed according to Joseph v. Passaic Hospital Ass’n, \\n26 N.J. 557\\n\\n\\n(1958), to prevent confusion because “[t]here is no offer, acceptance,\\n\\nconsideration in the context of the [Bylaws].” 7 After a dialogue over the\\n\\nmeaning of Joseph, the trial judge stated that plaintiffs “still need to prove the\\n\\nexistence of a contract. And the mere fact that there are [Bylaws] doesn’t\\n\\nmean that they had a contract for what’s at issue here at trial.”\\n\\n        Ultimately, as to plaintiffs’ claim that Valley violated the Bylaws by\\n\\nwithdrawing their privileges without a hearing, the judge instructed the jury\\n\\nthat,\\n\\n              [t]o establish [their] contract claim against the\\n              defendant[,] plaintiffs must prove that, one, the parties\\n              entered into a contract containing certain terms.\\n\\n\\n7\\n  In Joseph, this Court held that, under the hospital’s medical staff bylaws, the\\nplaintiff physician was entitled to a hearing before the hospital revoked his\\nprivileges. \\n26 N.J. at 570\\n.\\n                                        17\\n              Two, the plaintiff[s] did what the contract required the\\n             plaintiffs to do.\\n\\n             Three, the defendant did not do what the contract\\n             required the defendant to do. This failure is called a\\n             breach of the contract.\\n\\n             Four, the defendant’s breach or failure to do what the\\n             contract required caused a loss to the plaintiffs.\\n\\nIn his more detailed instructions on contract formation principles, the judge\\n\\nexplained:\\n\\n             There is no requirement that a contract be in writing,\\n             that it be dated, or that it be signed by either party. It\\n             can be entirely oral or it can [be] partly oral and partly\\n             in writing. A contract can be made of several different\\n             documents if the parties intended that their agreement\\n             would include the various documents together.\\n\\n             Express or implied contract. A contract may be\\n             expressed, or implied, or it may be a mixture of the two.\\n             An expressed contract is one in which the parties have\\n             shown their agreements by words. Expressed contracts\\n             include those in which the parties have orally stated the\\n             terms to each other or have placed the terms in writing.\\n             An implied contract is one in which the parties show\\n             their agreement by conduct. For example if someone\\n             provides services to another under circumstances that\\n             do not support the idea that they were donated or free[,]\\n             the law implies an obligation to pay the reasonable\\n             value of services. Thus, an implied contract is an\\n             agreement and for -- from the parties conduct or from\\n             the circumstances surrounding their relationship.\\n\\n             In other words, a defendant may be obligated to pay for\\n             services rendered for defendant by plaintiff if the\\n             circumstances are such that the plaintiff reasonably\\n             expected the defendant to compensate plaintiff and if a\\n                                        18\\n             reasonable person in defendant’s position would know\\n            that plaintiff was performing the services expecting that\\n            the defendant would pay for them.\\n\\nHe continued by describing to the jury the weight to be given to the parties’\\n\\nreasonable expectations and course of dealing in determining the terms of a\\n\\ncontract.\\n\\n      The judge twice instructed the jurors about plaintiffs’ “theory” on their\\n\\nbreach of contract claim:\\n\\n            Plaintiffs claim the following terms were part of the\\n            contract. That a hearing was provided in The Valley\\n            Hospital bylaws for the purpose of resolving any matter\\n            bearing on professional privileges, competency,\\n            personal conduct, or any other matters involving or\\n            related to the hospital bylaw or the medical staff bylaw\\n            rules and regulations.\\n\\n            Plaintiff[s] further claim that the parties intended this\\n            to mean that the plaintiffs were entitled to a hospital\\n            hearing before The Valley Hospital entered an\\n            agreement with [the Columbia Group] to make [the\\n            Columbia Group] the exclusive provider at The Valley\\n            Hospital for Emergency Department on-call duties for\\n            unassigned patients, gamma knife services, and\\n            neurointerventional biplane angiography services.\\n\\n            The Valley Hospital contends that the bylaws did not\\n            require a hearing to be held in these circumstances\\n            because the decision to enter the agreement with [the\\n            Columbia Group] was a hospital-wide decision.\\n\\nThis first set of instructions on plaintiffs’ theory of breach thus focused\\n\\nexclusively on the Bylaws as the underlying contract, despite the judge’s\\n\\n                                        19\\n instruction to the jury on the law governing express or implied contracts and\\n\\nthe parties’ expectations and course of dealings. But when the judge next\\n\\ninstructed the jury on plaintiffs’ “claims of breach,” he added a statement that\\n\\nplaintiffs claimed that “defendant breached the contract by conducting a sham\\n\\nstudy and failing to provide them with a hospital hearing prior to terminating\\n\\ntheir access to the Emergency Department on-call schedule for unassigned\\n\\npatients, gamma knife services, and neurointerventional biplane angiography\\n\\nservices.” (emphasis added).\\n\\n      The trial judge then provided the following instructions about the\\n\\nallegation that Valley separately breached the implied covenant of good faith\\n\\nand fair dealing:\\n\\n            Implied terms, covenant of good faith, and fair dealing.\\n            The plaintiffs . . . in this case contend that [Valley]\\n            breached what is known as the implied covenant of\\n            good faith and fair dealing. In addition to the expressed\\n            terms of a contract[,] the law provides that every\\n            contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and\\n            fair dealing.    This means that even though not\\n            specifically stated in the contract it is implied or\\n            understood that each party to the contract must act in\\n            good faith and deal fairly with the other party in\\n            performing or enforcing the terms of the contract.\\n\\n            ....\\n\\n            The plaintiff[s] in this case claim[] that the defendant\\n            Valley breached the implied covenant [of] good faith\\n            and fair dealing by encouraging plaintiffs to join Valley\\n            and take over the Emergency Department call schedule\\n                                       20\\n [and] invest time, resources, and efforts to modernize\\nthe practice of neurosurgery at Valley, but then unfairly\\nand dishonestly barring plaintiffs from using the tools\\nand facilities they developed.\\n\\nPlaintiffs further contend that Valley breached the\\ncovenant of good faith by making a predetermined\\ndecision to exclude plaintiffs[,] creating a sham study\\nby changing metrics to achieve its intended goal of\\nskewing [plaintiffs’] results to show poor quality[,] and\\nnegotiat[ing] [a] contract with the [Columbia] Group\\nbefore the study even began. To prevail on this claim[,]\\nthe plaintiff[s] must prove each of the following three\\nelements by a preponderance of the evidence.\\n\\nFirst, the plaintiff[s] must prove that some type of\\ncontract existed between the parties. There can [be] no\\nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing\\nunless the parties had a contract.\\n\\nSecond, the plaintiff[s] must prove that the defendant\\nacted in bad faith with the purpose of depriving the\\nplaintiff[s] of rights or benefits under the contract.\\n\\nThird, the plaintiff[s] must prove that the defendant’s\\nconduct caused the plaintiff[s] to suffer injury, damage,\\nloss, or harm.\\n\\nExpress or implied contract. If you find that a contract\\nexisted between the parties, you must then determine\\nwhether the defendant violated the implied covenant of\\ngood faith and fair dealing. Did the defendant act in\\nbad faith with the intent to deprive the plaintiff[s] of\\nrights or benefits under the contract? As to this element\\nyou must decide whether the defendant acted with bad\\nfaith to interfere with the plaintiffs’ right to receive\\nbenefits of the contract.\\n\\n....\\n\\n                           21\\n             In summary, if you find that the plaintiff[s] [have]\\n            proven by a preponderance of the evidence, one, the\\n            existence of some type of contract, two, that the\\n            defendant although acting consistently with the\\n            contract’s terms acted in bad faith with the intent to\\n            deprive the plaintiff[s] of [their] reasonable\\n            expectations under the contract, and, three, the\\n            plaintiff[s] sustained loss as a result of such action, then\\n            you must find for the plaintiff[s].\\n\\n      The judge concluded his instructions on plaintiffs’ two claims -- the\\n\\nbreach of contract claim and the breach of the implied covenant of good faith\\n\\nand fair dealing claim -- by providing guidance as to the award of damages,\\n\\nspecifying that damages were available for both the breach of contract and\\n\\nbreach of covenant claim.\\n\\n                                        4.\\n\\n      The verdict sheet presented the jury with two claims, each determined by\\n\\nthree questions.\\n\\n      The first three questions on the six-question verdict sheet related to what\\n\\nthe sheet labeled as plaintiffs’ “Breach of Contract” claim:\\n\\n            1. Have the plaintiffs, Comprehensive Neurosurgical\\n            PC, proven by a preponderance of the evidence that\\n            there was an enforceable contract between plaintiffs\\n            and defendants?\\n\\n            If “yes” proceed to Question # 2, If “no” proceed to\\n            Question # 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        22\\n               2. Did the defendants breach the contract with the\\n              plaintiff[s], Comprehensive Neurosurgical PC, by\\n              terminating the services without holding a hearing?\\n\\n              If “yes” proceed to Question # 3, If “no” proceed to\\n              Question # 4.\\n\\n              3. What amount of damages, if any, [have] the\\n              plaintiff[s],  Comprehensive    Neurosurgical   PC\\n              established that the defendant owe[s] them for any\\n              breach of contract?\\n\\nThe jury voted 6-0 that there was a contract between plaintiffs and Valley\\n\\n(question one) and then voted 5-1 that Valley did not breach that contract by\\n\\ndeclining to hold a hearing before revoking plaintiffs’ privileges (question\\n\\ntwo). The jurors thus found no cause of action on the breach of contract claim\\n\\nand did not reach question three concerning damages on that claim.\\n\\n      Significantly, after question three, the verdict sheet instructed the jurors\\n\\nas follows:\\n\\n              If you have awarded damages in Question #3, then skip\\n              Questions #4, #5, and #6[.]\\n\\nThus, if the jury awarded damages on the breach of contract claim -- failure to\\n\\ngrant a hearing under the Bylaws -- then the jurors were instructed not to reach\\n\\nplaintiffs’ second claim dealing with the implied covenant of good faith and\\n\\nfair dealing. Because the jury did not award damages in question three, the\\n\\njurors considered the remaining three questions on the verdict sheet, presented\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        23\\n under a separate heading entitled “Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair\\n\\nDealing”:\\n\\n             4. Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that\\n             the Valley Hospital and Comprehensive Neurosurgical\\n             PC entered into a contract?\\n\\n             If “yes” proceed to Question #5, If “no” cease your\\n             deliberations.\\n\\n             5. Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that\\n             the defendant, The Valley Hospital violated the\\n             Covenant of good faith and fair dealing with the\\n             purpose of depriving the plaintiffs, Comprehensive\\n             Neurosurgical, PC of their reasonably expected rights\\n             or benefits under the contract?\\n\\n             If “yes” proceed to Question #6, If “no” cease your\\n             deliberations.\\n\\n             6. What amount of damages, if any, [have] the\\n             plaintiff[s], Comprehensive Neurosurgical, PC\\n             established that the defendant, The Valley Hospital\\n             owe[s] them for the violation of the covenant of good\\n             faith and fair dealing?\\n\\nThe jury answered questions four and five in the affirmative by a 6-0 vote and,\\n\\nin question six, the jury awarded plaintiffs $24,300,000 in damages by a 5-1\\n\\nvote.\\n\\n        Valley moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the\\n\\nalternative, a new trial on the implied covenant claim because according to\\n\\nValley, plaintiffs had no reasonable expectations under the Bylaws that they\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       24\\n would have privileges in perpetuity. The judge denied those motions,\\n\\nreasoning that\\n\\n            [t]he jury was presented with testimony from multiple\\n            witnesses regarding the history of the relationship\\n            between the two parties and the extent of that\\n            relationship [--] which went beyond the bounds of the\\n            [B]ylaws. The jury was within its rights to find that\\n            [plaintiffs] had a reasonable expectation of continuing\\n            this relationship with [Valley] in much the same way as\\n            it had since 2005.\\n\\n            [(emphasis added).]\\n\\n                                       C.\\n\\n      Valley appealed, challenging both the denial of summary judgment and\\n\\nthe verdict in favor of plaintiffs on the implied covenant of good faith and fair\\n\\ndealing claim. Valley further argued that the verdict was legally deficient and\\n\\ntainted by (1) reference to Valley’s privileged emails, which it should have\\n\\nbeen permitted to claw back, and (2) improper summation remarks by\\n\\nplaintiffs’ counsel about the absence of evidence of patient transfers, given\\n\\nthat such evidence undisputedly existed but was not admissible.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division affirmed both the trial judge’s denial of\\n\\nsummary judgment and the jury’s verdict. The appellate court found that\\n\\nValley was not entitled to summary judgment on the implied covenant claim,\\n\\nreasoning that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing could have attached\\n\\nto an underlying contract beyond the rights afforded by the Bylaws. The\\n                                       25\\n appellate court also found that the jury was not tainted by the admission into\\n\\nevidence of privileged attorney-client emails or the challenged summation\\n\\ncomments.\\n\\n                                       D.\\n\\n      We granted Valley’s petition for certification, limited to the\\n\\nconsideration of plaintiffs’ implied covenant claim, as well as “whether\\n\\ndefendants waived the attorney-client privilege for certain communications,\\n\\nand whether plaintiffs’ counsel made improper or misleading comments during\\n\\nsummation about transferring patients that require a new trial.” \\n254 N.J. 210\\n\\n\\n(2023). We also granted motions from the New Jersey Hospital Association\\n\\n(NJHA), the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the Medical Society\\n\\nof New Jersey and the American Medical Association (jointly, MSNJ) to\\n\\nappear as amici curiae.\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n      Valley argues it is entitled to summary judgment on the implied\\n\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing claim. It maintains that the Bylaws\\n\\ncannot serve as an underlying contract and that the implied covenant claim is\\n\\nduplicative of the breach of contract claim. If the Court disagrees, Valley\\n\\nrequests that we remand for a new trial because the jury was substantially\\n\\ntainted by the erroneous admission of privileged attorney-client emails and by\\n\\n                                       26\\n improper summation remarks. At oral argument before us, Valley conceded\\n\\nthat every contract has an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing but\\n\\nsuggested that the jury misunderstood that such an underlying contract could\\n\\nbe the Bylaws.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs asserted at oral argument that their implied covenant claim was\\n\\nproperly before the jury and that the jury was appropriately charged on that\\n\\nclaim. Acknowledging that there must be an underlying contract to make such\\n\\na claim, plaintiffs argue that the parties’ “historical relationship” supports the\\n\\nexistence of an implied contract, one that goes beyond the rights afforded\\n\\nunder the Bylaws. Plaintiffs reiterate that Valley waived the attorney-client\\n\\nprivilege by placing the White Paper “in-issue” and that Valley’s disclosure of\\n\\nthe emails containing legal advice to and from Goldfischer was not\\n\\ninadvertent. Alternatively, if there was no waiver and the summation\\n\\ncomments are deemed improper, plaintiffs argue that any error is harmless\\n\\ngiven the “extensive remaining evidence.”\\n\\n      NJHA and AHA support Valley’s position. NJHA argues that a\\n\\nhospital’s administrative healthcare decision cannot be challenged on contract-\\n\\nbased theories seeking monetary relief. Allowing otherwise, NJHA claims,\\n\\nwould undermine the broad deference courts afford a hospital’s administrative\\n\\nhealthcare decision under Berman. AHA emphasizes that medical staff bylaws\\n\\n                                        27\\n organize the medical staff into a cohesive unit and that upholding this\\n\\n“unprecedented” verdict would impair a hospital’s ability to make decisions\\n\\nfor patients and communities.\\n\\n      MSNJ supports plaintiffs’ arguments and urges that hospitals should be\\n\\nheld “to the standard of good faith and fair dealing” to prevent “abuse” of the\\n\\ncredentialing process because such “abuse” would harm patient care, increase\\n\\nmedical costs, unfairly question qualified physicians, and interfere with\\n\\nphysicians’ medical practices. MSNJ asserts that providing an exclusive\\n\\nagreement to a loyal practice group, while punishing a non-loyal group, is\\n\\ncontrary to a nonprofit hospital’s charitable purpose and is harmful to the\\n\\nhealthcare system.\\n\\n                                       IV.\\n\\n      The main issue in this case is the viability of plaintiffs’ claim for breach\\n\\nof the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\\n\\n      A covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied by law into every\\n\\ncontract. Brunswick Hills Racquet Club, Inc. v. Route 18 Shopping Ctr.\\n\\nAssocs., \\n182 N.J. 210\\n, 224 (2005). The implied covenant of good faith and\\n\\nfair dealing requires the “parties to a contract to refrain from doing ‘anything\\n\\nwhich will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party\\n\\nto receive’ the benefits of the contract.” \\nId. at 224-25\\n (emphasis added)\\n\\n                                        28\\n (quoting Palisades Props., Inc. v. Brunetti, \\n44 N.J. 117\\n, 130 (1965)). Although\\n\\n“[p]roof of ‘bad motive or intention’ is vital to” the claim, \\nid. at 225\\n (quoting\\n\\nWilson v. Amerada Hess Corp., \\n168 N.J. 236\\n, 251 (2001)), such proof is not\\n\\nenough on its own. Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant’s\\n\\nalleged misdeeds prevented the plaintiff from enjoying the full benefit of the\\n\\nterms of a particular bargain. See id. at 226 (“A plaintiff may be entitled to\\n\\nrelief under the covenant if its reasonable expectations are destroyed when a\\n\\ndefendant acts with ill motives and without any legitimate purpose.”\\n\\n(emphasis added)).\\n\\n      As this appeal comes to us, the central dispute concerns whether there is\\n\\na contractual basis for plaintiffs to claim that their reasonable expectations\\n\\nwere left unmet due to Valley’s alleged unfair dealing. Valley argues that\\n\\nthere is no underlying contract to which plaintiffs’ breach of covenant claim\\n\\ncould attach. Valley therefore contends that the claim should never have\\n\\nreached the jury. Valley claims, in the alternative, that the jury’s verdict\\n\\ncannot stand because the jury was never properly instructed that it must find a\\n\\nvalid contract between the parties to find a breach of the implied covenant of\\n\\ngood faith and fair dealing.\\n\\n      Three separate bases have been tied to Valley’s alleged obligation to act\\n\\nin good faith: (1) the Bylaws; (2) Valley’s administrative hospital decision to\\n\\n                                        29\\n enter into the Exclusive Agreement, which in essence revoked plaintiffs’\\n\\nprivileges to use the “Gamma Knife” and “Biplane” technologies and their\\n\\nright to treat “unassigned” ER patients; and (3) an alleged oral or implied\\n\\ncontract between the parties that, according to plaintiffs, led them to join\\n\\nValley and to strive, over the course of a decade, to build and enhance Valley’s\\n\\nneuroscience department, while expecting to indefinitely maintain their\\n\\nprivileges and rights absent a valid administrative healthcare decision\\n\\nproviding otherwise. Those three sources are entirely distinct from one\\n\\nanother, and their separate characteristics have important consequences for the\\n\\ntypes of claims that can be brought based on each source, the proofs necessary\\n\\nto prove those claims, and the types of relief available for each claim if\\n\\nproven.\\n\\n      We therefore begin our discussion of the breach of covenant claim by\\n\\nreviewing the nature of the claims that can arise under a hospital’s medical\\n\\nstaff bylaws and, separately, under a hospital’s administrative healthcare\\n\\ndecision, as well as the showing necessary to support the existence of an\\n\\nimplied or oral contract.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        30\\nA.\\n\\n1\\n.\\n\\n      Although medical staff bylaws impose reciprocal legal obligations and\\n\\nrights between those who agreed to be bound -- obligations that have been and\\n\\nwill continue to be reviewed and enforced by a court if necessary -- we hold\\n\\nthat those obligations are not technically “contractual” in nature. We clarify\\n\\nthat while “[t]hose bound together in the common enterprise have reciprocal\\n\\nrights and duties laid down in the Constitution and [bylaws],” Joseph, \\n26 N.J.\\n\\nat 569\\n, medical staff bylaws cannot serve as an underlying contract to support\\n\\nan alleged breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim,\\n\\nnor can a violation of those bylaws support an independent claim for money\\n\\ndamages.\\n\\n      Medical staff bylaws provide internal rules and procedures that govern\\n\\nthe medical staff. Like other states, New Jersey requires hospitals to adopt\\n\\nmedical staff bylaws. See N.J.A.C. 8:43G-16.1(a) (“Bylaws governing all\\n\\nmedical staff members shall be implemented.”); Belmar v. Cipolla, \\n96 N.J.\\n\\n199\\n, 208 (1984) (“[H]ospitals must adopt rules, regulations, and bylaws\\n\\nconcerning procedures for admission to staff membership . . . .”). In addition\\n\\nto establishing physician qualifications, medical staff bylaws afford certain\\n\\nprocedural rights to physicians whose hospital rights and privileges are\\n\\n                                       31\\n negatively impacted. But more importantly, medical staff bylaws ensure that\\n\\nhospitals and physicians provide quality and ethical healthcare.\\n\\n         However, the fundamental elements of contract formation are missing in\\n\\nthe context of medical staff bylaws -- there is no mutual assent, offer and\\n\\nacceptance, or consideration. See Weichert Co. Realtors v. Ryan, \\n128 N.J.\\n\\n427\\n, 435 (1992) (providing the requirements for an enforceable contract and\\n\\nnoting that when “parties agree on essential terms and manifest an intention to\\n\\nbe bound by those terms,” there is an enforceable contract). Here, there is no\\n\\nevidence that the parties negotiated or engaged in the “bargained-for exchange\\n\\nof promises or performance that may consist of an act, a forbearance, or the\\n\\ncreation, modification, or destruction of a legal relation” in the adoption of\\n\\nValley’s Medical Staff Bylaws. Shebar v. Sanyo Bus. Sys. Corp., \\n111 N.J.\\n\\n276\\n, 289 (1988). The Bylaws existed long before plaintiffs joined the Medical\\n\\nStaff.\\n\\n         Moreover, plaintiffs mistakenly relied upon Joseph to support their\\n\\ncontention that medical staff bylaws create a legally binding contract and may\\n\\notherwise be used to support a contract claim seeking money damages. Such a\\n\\nliteral reading is misplaced. In Joseph, a surgeon sued a hospital seeking,\\n\\namong other relief, reinstatement of his “emeritus staff” status. \\n26 N.J. at 561\\n.\\n\\nIn remanding his equity suit, this Court held that the hospital’s constitution\\n\\n                                         32\\n and medical staff bylaws provided the surgeon with a right to a hearing, but\\n\\nbecause the hospital failed to honor that right, the hospital’s action was “null.”\\n\\nId. at 570, 575\\n.\\n\\n      In reaching that conclusion, the Court stated that\\n\\n            [t]hose bound together in the common enterprise have\\n            reciprocal rights and duties laid down in the\\n            Constitution and [bylaws] and such as are inherent in\\n            the nature of the undertaking; and judicial interposition\\n            may be had to avert unreason and unconscionable and\\n            excessive action, such as would offend against natural\\n            justice. The Association’s Constitution and [bylaws]\\n            are essentially conventional; the compact derives from\\n            the common consent of the parties and is limited\\n            accordingly.\\n\\n            [Id. at 569 (citations omitted).]\\n\\nAs emphasized, medical staff bylaws do impose binding obligations -- such as\\n\\nthe hospital’s obligation to afford a hearing in certain settings -- and “judicial\\n\\ninterposition may be had to avert unreason and unconscionable and excessive\\n\\naction.” \\nIbid.\\n But those obligations do not give rise to a traditional contract,\\n\\nto a claim for the traditional contract remedy of damages, or to a separate\\n\\nbreach of the implied covenant claim.\\n\\n      Instead, when a hospital violates its medical staff bylaws, equitable\\n\\nrelief may be available. Thus, plaintiffs here, like the plaintiff in Joseph,\\n\\nwould have been entitled to a hearing if Valley had violated the Bylaws by\\n\\nfailing to provide one in the first place. But the Bylaws include no promise\\n                                        33\\n that plaintiffs’ privileges would never be limited, and they therefore offer no\\n\\nbasis for the equitable restoration of plaintiffs’ privileges, let alone monetary\\n\\ndamages for any alleged bad faith actions in altering their privileges. And\\n\\nhere, the jury expressly found that Valley did not violate the Bylaws. 8\\n\\n      In short, the Bylaws cannot constitute the underlying contract for\\n\\npurposes of plaintiffs’ separate breach of the implied covenant of good faith\\n\\nand fair dealing claim.\\n\\n                                        2.\\n\\n      Just as the Bylaws here offer no ground for a breach of an implied\\n\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, Valley’s administrative\\n\\nhealthcare decision to award exclusive privileges to the Columbia Group\\n\\ncannot on its own give rise to a claim for breach of the implied covenant of\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n  The jury’s no-cause verdict on plaintiffs’ so-called “breach of contract”\\nclaim is not before us and cannot be relitigated. Here, as is often the case, the\\nBylaws did not meet the basic elements of contract formation -- mutual assent,\\noffer and acceptance, and consideration. In such instances, we note that an\\nalleged breach of medical staff bylaws is not and should not be presented as a\\nbreach of contract claim. The jury should not be instructed on contract\\nformation or the different types of contracts or asked to find that a contract had\\nbeen formed between the parties. Nor should the jury be prompted to award\\ndamages on such a claim. On the verdict sheet in this appeal, there should\\nhave been only one question on the “breach of contract” claim which should\\nhave read: “Under the Bylaws, were plaintiffs entitled to a hearing?” If the\\njury had answered that hypothetical question “Yes,” then the judge could have\\nordered equitable relief -- a hearing -- not money damages, as question three\\nimpermissibly allowed.\\n                                         34\\n good faith and fair dealing, although equitable relief might be available under\\n\\ncertain circumstances.\\n\\n      We have long held, and we reaffirm here, that hospitals maintain “broad\\n\\ndiscretionary powers” in making administrative decisions related to healthcare.\\n\\nSee Desai, \\n103 N.J. at 90\\n. Courts generally defer to a hospital’s administrative\\n\\nhealthcare decisions given “the intrinsic complexities that abound in the area\\n\\nof institutional public health care.” \\nId. at 91-92\\n. And when those decisions\\n\\ninvolve the enactment of “broad” hospital policies, like a closed or restrictive\\n\\nstaff-admissions policy, “the freedom of decisional action accorded a hospital\\n\\nis even greater and judicial review [is] more tolerant,” Berman, \\n103 N.J. at\\n\\n107\\n, even though such an admission policy will inevitably have a\\n\\ndiscriminatory impact upon some doctors, Desai, \\n103 N.J. at 91\\n. This includes\\n\\na hospital’s decision to enter into an exclusive agreement that grants privileges\\n\\nto one group of physicians, typically at the expense of another. See, e.g.,\\n\\nCipolla, \\n96 N.J. at 211\\n (upholding an exclusive contract for anesthesia services\\n\\nbecause it “was motivated by the hospital’s desire to [ensure] a high standard\\n\\nof medical care,” where the benefits included 24-hour coverage, less\\n\\nadministrative issues, and more efficient operating rooms).\\n\\n      But the discretion afforded to hospitals in making such decisions is not\\n\\nunlimited: “A hospital exercises its [healthcare] powers ‘in trust,’ ‘for the\\n\\n                                       35\\n benefit of the public,’ and ‘in aid of [its] service to the public.’” Berman, 103\\n\\nN.J. at 106 (second alteration in original) (quoting Greisman v. Newcomb\\n\\nHosp., \\n40 N.J. 389\\n, 403-04 (1963)). In the seminal case of Falcone v.\\n\\nMiddlesex County Medical Society, this Court first recognized that\\n\\nassociations engaged in “activities vitally affecting the health and welfare of\\n\\nthe people” have fiduciary powers that are “to be exercised in [a] reasonable\\n\\nand lawful manner for the advancement of the interests of the medical\\n\\nprofession and the public generally.” \\n34 N.J. 582\\n, 596-97 (1961). Two years\\n\\nlater, in Greisman, this Court extended that rationale to the context of a\\n\\nhospital’s selection of its medical staff. \\n40 N.J. at 402-04\\n. Since then, this\\n\\nCourt has continuously emphasized the important societal role hospitals play\\n\\nwhen enacting healthcare policies. See, e.g., Doe v. Bridgeton Hosp. Ass’n,\\n\\nInc., \\n71 N.J. 478\\n, 487 (1976); Cipolla, \\n96 N.J. at 208\\n; Desai, \\n103 N.J. at 86\\n;\\n\\nBerman, \\n103 N.J. at 106\\n; Nanavati v. Burdette Tomlin Mem’l Hosp., \\n107 N.J.\\n\\n240\\n, 248 (1987).\\n\\n      And, in recognition of the hospital’s obligations to the public it serves,\\n\\nwe have held that a hospital’s administrative healthcare decision will be\\n\\nupheld only if that decision: (1) genuinely serves a public healthcare\\n\\nobjective; (2) “is reached in the normal and regular course of conducting the\\n\\naffairs of the hospital[;] and [(3)] is based on adequate information, regardless\\n\\n                                       36\\n of form, origin, or authorship, that is generally considered reasonable and\\n\\nreliable by professional persons responsibly involved in the [healthcare] field.”\\n\\nDesai, 103 N.J. at 91-93. This presupposes good faith. A hospital may not act\\n\\nin bad faith and simultaneously serve a “genuine” healthcare objective based\\n\\non “reasonable and reliable” information. In furtherance of the public’s well-\\n\\nsettled interests in healthcare, we hold that a reasonable, rational, and valid\\n\\nhealthcare decision must be made in good faith. In other words, a hospital\\n\\nhealthcare policy made in bad faith under the guise of a genuine public\\n\\nhealthcare objective cannot withstand judicial scrutiny.\\n\\n      Physicians who are adversely affected by a hospital’s administrative\\n\\nhealthcare decision, therefore, may challenge that decision by arguing that it\\n\\nwas not made in accordance with the three-part standard set forth in Desai. In\\n\\na case concerning a chiropractor who argued that he was impermissibly denied\\n\\nprivileges due to a hospital’s exclusionary staff policy, the Appellate Division\\n\\nexplained:\\n\\n             While plaintiff was not entitled to any procedural\\n             protections under the bylaws or the Fourteenth\\n             Amendment, he was entitled to have his claim reviewed\\n             under the special standard developed by our courts for\\n             review of administrative decisions treating exclusion of\\n             certain categories of practitioners, as distinguished\\n             from decisions on the qualifications of individual\\n             applicants. . . . [Greisman, \\n40 N.J. at 403-04\\n, and\\n             Falcone, \\n34 N.J. at 597\\n] permitted judicial review of\\n             exclusionary policies[] on the theory that hospitals\\n                                        37\\n             acted as fiduciaries for the public and could not\\n            exercise their discretion over staff composition without\\n            considering the interests of the medical profession and\\n            the public.\\n\\n            [Petrocco v. Dover Gen. Hosp. & Med. Ctr., \\n273 N.J.\\nSuper. 501\\n, 513-14 (App. Div. 1994) (emphases\\n            added).]\\n\\n      Here, the trial judge concluded that plaintiffs’ challenge to the Exclusive\\n\\nAgreement -- the Berman claim -- was “subsumed” with their implied\\n\\ncovenant claim. As a result, plaintiffs no longer had a stand-alone Berman\\n\\nclaim. Instead, the legal principles of Berman became relevant only as to\\n\\nValley’s defense to plaintiffs’ implied covenant claim, which was premised on\\n\\nan alleged oral or implied contract providing them certain rights and privileges\\n\\nin perpetuity. At trial, Valley defended against that claim by introducing\\n\\nevidence to prove that it made a valid healthcare decision by entering into the\\n\\nExclusive Agreement. Plaintiffs therefore sought money damages not for a\\n\\nBerman violation, but rather for an alleged breach of the implied covenant of\\n\\ngood faith and fair dealing, which attached to an alleged oral or implied\\n\\ncontract beyond the rights afforded under the Bylaws.\\n\\n                                        3.\\n\\n      The final basis advanced in the course of this litigation for finding that\\n\\nValley was bound to act in good faith and deal fairly with plaintiffs is an\\n\\nalleged implied contract between the parties, one that goes “beyond the\\n                                       38\\n Bylaws.” Plaintiffs allege that, from Valley’s initial offer to join and\\n\\ncollaboratively build Valley’s neuroscience department and from the parties’\\n\\ncourse of dealings since plaintiffs joined, it can be reasonably inferred that an\\n\\nimplied contract existed between plaintiffs and Valley. That purported\\n\\ncontract allegedly imposed obligations beyond the provisions of the Bylaws.\\n\\nIn the event that plaintiffs could demonstrate that all the fundamental elements\\n\\nof contract formation had been established, their theory of an agreement\\n\\nbeyond the rights afforded by the Bylaws would be contractual in nature. It\\n\\ncould thus serve as the underlying contract to support a claim for breach of the\\n\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and could provide a proper\\n\\nbasis for damages.\\n\\n      Essentially, plaintiffs argue that an “implied-in-fact” contract existed\\n\\nbetween them and Valley. “[C]ontracts implied in fact are no different than\\n\\nexpress contracts, although they exhibit a different way or form of expressing\\n\\nassent than through statements or writings. Courts often find and enforce\\n\\nimplied promises by interpretation of a promisor’s word and conduct in light\\n\\nof the surrounding circumstances.” Wanaque Borough Sewerage Auth. v.\\n\\nTownship of West Milford, \\n144 N.J. 564\\n, 574 (1996). And, despite the\\n\\ndifference in the way the contracts are created, an implied-in-fact contract is\\n\\ngenerally “as binding as [an] express contract.” Troy v. Rutgers, \\n168 N.J. 354\\n,\\n\\n                                        39\\n 365 (2001). “[T]here is no distinction in the effect of the promise whether it is\\n\\nexpressed in writing, or orally, or in acts, or partly in one of these ways and\\n\\npartly in others.” \\nIbid.\\n (alteration in original) (quoting Restatement (Second)\\n\\nof Contracts § 19 cmt. a (Am. Law Inst. 1981)).\\n\\n      Thus, an implied-in-fact contract may form based on the parties’ actions,\\n\\ncourse of conduct, oral expressions, or a combination of the three. See ibid.\\n\\nAnd, significantly, an implied-in-fact contract gives rise to the implied\\n\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing regarding the performance of that\\n\\ncontract. Guz v. Bechtel Nat’l, Inc., \\n8 P.3d 1089\\n, 1112 (Cal. 2000) (noting\\n\\nthat the breach of an implied contract “may also constitute a breach of the\\n\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing” but that, “insofar as the\\n\\nemployer’s acts are directly actionable as a [direct] breach of an implied-in-\\n\\nfact contract term, a claim that merely realleges that breach as a violation of\\n\\nthe covenant is superfluous”).\\n\\n      Among the three possible sources to support plaintiffs’ claim here -- the\\n\\nBylaws, Valley’s “Berman” decision, and the alleged implied-in-fact contract\\n\\nbetween plaintiffs and Valley -- the only alleged source of mutual obligation to\\n\\nwhich the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing could properly\\n\\nattach to is the implied-in-fact contract. Whether plaintiffs’ implied covenant\\n\\nclaim properly survived summary judgment and was appropriately considered\\n\\n                                        40\\n by the jury thus depends on plaintiffs’ implied-in-fact contract theory. We\\n\\nfirst consider whether the claim properly survived summary judgment.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      When reviewing a denial of summary judgment, “we apply the same\\n\\nstandard governing the trial court.” Qian v. Toll Brothers, Inc., \\n223 N.J. 124\\n,\\n\\n134-35 (2015) (quoting Murray v. Plainfield Rescue Squad, \\n210 N.J. 581\\n, 584\\n\\n(2012)). Thus, “view[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\\n\\nmoving party,” ibid., summary judgment must be granted if based on “the\\n\\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file,\\n\\ntogether with the affidavits, if any,” “there is no genuine issue as to any\\n\\nmaterial fact challenged and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment or\\n\\norder as a matter of law,” Rule 4:46-2(c); Brill v. Guardian Life Insurance Co.\\n\\nof America, \\n142 N.J. 520\\n, 528-29 (1995).\\n\\n      Here, there are two questions pertinent to Valley’s motion to dismiss the\\n\\nimplied covenant claim on summary judgment. First, we must consider\\n\\nwhether there is a factual dispute as to whether an underlying contract, beyond\\n\\nthe rights afforded under the Bylaws, supports the implied covenant claim, and\\n\\nsecond, we must decide whether there is a factual dispute concerning Valley’s\\n\\nalleged bad faith conduct.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        41\\n       As to the first question, the answer is yes. A hospital can give doctors\\n\\nspecific privileges and rights beyond those afforded in the medical staff\\n\\nbylaws. Here, there is sufficient evidence in the summary judgment record,\\n\\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, to support the notion that\\n\\nthe parties had a special relationship -- rooted in part in their course of\\n\\ndealings for more than a decade -- that gave plaintiffs specific rights and\\n\\nobligations beyond the Bylaws.\\n\\n      On this point, several provisions in the Bylaws seemingly leave room for\\n\\nthe formation of such an extra agreement. For example, one provision\\n\\nreferences the possibility of a Medical Staff member having, in addition to\\n\\nrights under the Bylaws, “an actual contractual relationship with the Hospital.”\\n\\nAnd a 2013 letter from Meyers to Dr. Roth similarly raises the possibility of a\\n\\ncontract beyond any obligations created by the Bylaws. That letter stated:\\n\\n“Your appointment and clinical privileges also shall be subject to the terms\\n\\nand provisions of any contract, should you have one with the Hospital.”\\n\\n      Moreover, whether parties’ interactions rise to the level of creating an\\n\\nimplied contract is generally a question of fact best resolved by the jury. See\\n\\nTroy, \\n168 N.J. at 366\\n (“Whether the parties acted in a manner sufficient to\\n\\ncreate implied contractual terms is a question of fact generally precluding\\n\\nsummary judgment.”); Labus v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., \\n740 F. Supp.\\n\\n42\\n\\n 1053, 1063 (D.N.J. 1990) (noting, with regard to a claimed oral employment\\n\\ncontract, that “[t]he legitimacy of the representations and the reasonableness of\\n\\nthe employee’s reliance are questions for the finder of fact that are not\\n\\nappropriate for summary judgment”).\\n\\n      Looking at the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as we must\\n\\nat the summary judgment stage, the record shows plaintiffs “relied upon\\n\\nValley’s offer,” joined the Medical Staff, then “for the next dozen years, . . .\\n\\ninvested resources in building up their practice, reputation, and patient base.”\\n\\nPlaintiffs assert that they helped transform Valley into a “Neuroscience Center\\n\\nof Excellence.” The parties’ course of dealing supports an implied contract\\n\\nthat, in exchange for stopping the outflow of patients to other hospitals and by\\n\\ndevoting substantial time and resources to “modernizing Valley’s\\n\\nneurosurgical department” through establishing cutting-edge “Biplane” and\\n\\n“Gamma Knife” technology and the Valley “Spine Center,” Valley agreed that\\n\\nplaintiffs could continue to build their medical practice at Valley without any\\n\\nrestrictions on treating “unassigned” ER patients. 9 Such an arrangement --\\n\\nderived from an alleged implied-in-fact contract, oral contract, or otherwise --\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n  At oral argument before this Court, plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged that\\ntheir privileges were not granted in perpetuity and could have been revoked\\nprovided that Valley’s decision to do so was a valid administrative healthcare\\ndecision.\\n                                       43\\n went beyond the Bylaws because the Bylaws did not expressly give plaintiffs\\n\\nthose rights in exchange for modernizing Valley’s neurosurgical center. And\\n\\nbecause plaintiffs’ “breach of contract” claim pertains only to whether they\\n\\nwere entitled to a hearing under the Bylaws, plaintiffs’ two “contract” claims\\n\\nare not duplicative as they are based on two allegedly distinct contracts.\\n\\n      As to the second question, whether plaintiffs raised a factual dispute\\n\\nconcerning if Valley failed to deal with them fairly and in good faith, plaintiffs\\n\\npresented evidence that Valley created a “sham” White Paper to justify\\n\\n“oust[ing]” plaintiffs for being disloyal and entering an Exclusive Agreement\\n\\nas “a pretext for the exercise of a contractual right to terminate.” See\\n\\nSeidenberg v. Summit Bank, \\n348 N.J. Super. 243\\n, 260 (App. Div. 2002)\\n\\n(noting that breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is\\n\\nusually tied to one of three situations: “(1) when the contract does not provide\\n\\na term necessary to fulfill the parties’ expectations; (2) when bad faith served\\n\\nas a pretext for the exercise of a contractual right to terminate; and (3) when\\n\\nthe contract expressly provides a party with discretion regarding its\\n\\nperformance” (emphasis added) (citations omitted)). Here, plaintiffs adduced\\n\\nsufficient evidence to raise a genuine question about whether Valley acted in\\n\\nbad faith by having a predetermined outcome for the White Paper; by\\n\\nmanipulating the data and methodology utilized in creating that paper; and by\\n\\n                                       44\\n entering into the Exclusive Agreement based upon animus toward plaintiffs\\n\\nrather than valid healthcare concerns.\\n\\n      Therefore, applying our de novo standard of review, we hold that\\n\\nplaintiffs’ implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, supported by\\n\\nan alleged implied-in-fact contract, properly survived Valley’s motion for\\n\\nsummary judgment.\\n\\n                                         C.\\n\\n      Although we find that plaintiffs’ claim of breach of the implied covenant\\n\\nof good faith and fair dealing properly reached the jury, there were significant\\n\\nproblems in the jury instructions and verdict sheet that call into question the\\n\\njury’s verdict on that claim.\\n\\n                                         1.\\n\\n      We review whether the jury was adequately instructed on the law de\\n\\nnovo, affording no deference to the trial judge’s interpretive legal conclusions.\\n\\nFowler v.

Rather, we will reverse and order a new trial\\n\\nonly when “the jury could have come to a different result had it been correctly\\n\\ninstructed.” Viscik, \\n173 N.J. at 18\\n. And in construing a jury charge, we\\n\\nexamine it “as a whole, rather than focus on individual errors in isolation” by\\n\\nconsidering “the language surrounding an alleged error in order to determine\\n\\nits true effect.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n                                        46\\n       That includes consideration of how the relevant issues are presented on\\n\\nthe verdict sheet. The “verdict sheet constitutes part of the trial court’s\\n\\ndirection to the jury.” State v. Galicia, \\n210 N.J. 364\\n, 388 (2012); see also Bolz\\n\\nv. Bolz, \\n400 N.J. Super. 154\\n, 161-63 (App. Div. 2008) (assessing a verdict\\n\\nsheet as part of the jury instructions and concluding that the sheet’s failure to\\n\\nrequire a discrete mandatory finding on an issue required reversal and a new\\n\\ntrial). “[D]efects in the verdict sheet are reviewed on appeal under the same\\n\\n‘unjust result’ standard of Rule 2:10-2 that governs errors in the jury charge.”\\n\\nGalicia, 210 N.J. at 388.\\n\\n                                        2.\\n\\n      Here, we find several defects with the way the jury was charged. The\\n\\nverdict sheet compounded those problems, and contrary to plaintiffs’\\n\\nassertions at oral argument, the charge and verdict sheet cannot be “married\\n\\ntogether” to uphold the verdict. 10\\n\\n      The first problem with the final jury charge deals with the law given on\\n\\nplaintiffs’ “breach of contract” claim concerning the Bylaws. As plaintiffs’\\n\\ntrial counsel himself described at the charge conference: “This is not your\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n   Whether a correct verdict sheet can “cure” deficient verbal jury instructions\\nis a fact-sensitive question that must be considered on a case-by-case basis.\\nAnd here, as we explain, the incorrect verdict sheet compounded the errors in\\nthe jury charge.\\n                                        47\\n typical contract action.” Counsel repeatedly stressed to the judge that “[t]here\\n\\nis no offer, acceptance, [and] consideration in the context of the [Bylaws].”\\n\\nPlaintiffs’ trial counsel emphasized that charging the jury on basic contract\\n\\nformation principles, in his words, would “fundamentally mislead” the jurors.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs’ trial counsel was right. Contract formation principles should\\n\\nnot have been explained in the part of the final jury charge on plaintiffs’ claim\\n\\nthat Valley failed to give them a hearing, and the jury should not have been\\n\\nprompted through the verdict sheet to determine whether denial of a hearing\\n\\nwas a “breach” that warranted money damages. Had the jury found breach and\\n\\nawarded damages based on the failure to hold a hearing under the Bylaws, the\\n\\nverdict on the mislabeled “breach of contract” claim could not stand; as we\\n\\nexplained, all that could have been awarded based on a violation of the Bylaws\\n\\nwas a hearing.\\n\\n      The second problem with the jury charge is that the discussion of\\n\\ncontract formation was incorrectly included in the count predicated on the\\n\\nBylaws and erroneously omitted in the count for which it was indispensable --\\n\\nthe breach of covenant claim. Although plaintiffs rightly note that duplicate\\n\\ninstructions need not be given, finding the existence of a contract, which in\\n\\nthis case had to be one beyond the Bylaws, was an essential element of\\n\\nplaintiffs’ breach of the implied covenant claim. By failing to instruct the jury\\n\\n                                       48\\n on contract formation principles in connection to the only claim where that law\\n\\nwas applicable, the judge only heightened the potential that the jurors would\\n\\nbe led to believe that the Bylaws were a contract that could give rise to the\\n\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing.\\n\\n         This was reinforced by the jury sheet’s instruction that if damages are\\n\\ngranted for breach of the Bylaws, then the jury need not consider the breach of\\n\\ncovenant claim. Based on the way the two claims were presented to the jury,\\n\\nthe jury could have reasonably believed that it was being asked to assess\\n\\nwhether Valley violated the terms of the Bylaws or their spirit. As a result, we\\n\\nhave no way of reasonably knowing on appeal what purported “contract” or\\n\\n“contracts” the jurors regarded as the foundation for their damages award. To\\n\\nprevent that confusion, the word “contract” should not have appeared under\\n\\ncount one of the verdict sheet and should have been clarified as a “contract\\n\\nbeyond the rights afforded under the Bylaws” under count two of the verdict\\n\\nsheet.\\n\\n         The third problem concerns the judge’s attempt to frame the “parties’\\n\\ncontentions” considering “the applicable legal principles.” Prioleau, \\n223 N.J.\\n\\nat 256\\n (quoting Viscik, \\n173 N.J. at 18\\n). Valley argued in its defense to\\n\\nplaintiffs’ breach of covenant claim that it did not act unfairly or in bad faith\\n\\nbut rather made a valid healthcare decision in granting exclusive privileges to\\n\\n                                         49\\n the Columbia Group. It is perhaps that defense, predicated on Berman and\\n\\nDesai, that led the trial judge to conclude that plaintiffs’ challenge to the\\n\\nExclusive Agreement (i.e., the “Berman” claim) was “subsumed” within their\\n\\nimplied covenant claim. 11 But that decision disadvantaged both parties\\n\\nbecause the jury was never informed of the principles derived from Berman\\n\\nand Desai.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs conceded, even in the face of their implied covenant claim,\\n\\nthat Valley had the legal authority to make a valid healthcare decision. To that\\n\\npoint, plaintiffs’ trial counsel requested that the charge include Berman\\n\\nguidance so that the jury could measure the reasonableness of Valley’s defense\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n   Even though the judge ruled that the Berman claim was “subsumed” in the\\nimplied covenant claim, he expressed apprehension about the appropriate relief\\nfor a pure Berman violation. To be sure, equitable relief is appropriate for a\\nstand-alone Berman violation. But plaintiffs’ implied covenant claim is\\ndifferent than a stand-alone Berman claim. It is premised on plaintiffs’ theory\\nthat Valley acted in bad faith -- even before the purportedly pretextual White\\nPaper was released -- by deciding to enter into a “sham” Exclusive Agreement,\\nwhich plaintiffs argued had frustrated their reasonable expectations associated\\nwith an underlying implied or oral contract, one beyond the rights afforded by\\nthe Bylaws, to treat “unassigned” ER patients. The legal theories and remedies\\nfor a Berman claim and plaintiffs’ distinct implied covenant claim are\\ndifferent; one is not “subsumed” in the other. Nevertheless, plaintiffs have not\\nchallenged the trial judge’s “subsumed” ruling, and instead sought money\\ndamages only on their implied covenant claim. After the “subsumed” ruling,\\ntheir contention was not that the public was harmed by the Exclusive\\nAgreement, but rather, that plaintiffs were harmed and entitled to money\\ndamages because Valley breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair\\ndealing.\\n                                        50\\n that it made a valid healthcare decision. That request for a Berman jury charge\\n\\nwas in essence denied by the trial judge. Although the charge references “the\\n\\nrequirement of an objective healthcare basis” in passing when discussing the\\n\\nparties’ contentions, that was not enough. For the jury to properly assess the\\n\\nvalidity of Valley’s defense, i.e., that Valley acted “entirely lawful[ly] and\\n\\nappropriate[ly],” the judge needed to fully inform the jury of our\\n\\nBerman/Desai principles.\\n\\n      In other words, the charge should have included that a hospital’s\\n\\ndiscretionary healthcare decision is “entirely lawful” when it: (1) genuinely\\n\\nserves a public healthcare objective; (2) is made in the “regular course of\\n\\nconducting the affairs of the hospital”; and (3) is based on adequate, reliable,\\n\\nand reasonable information as would be relied upon “by professional persons\\n\\nresponsibly involved in the [healthcare] field.” Desai, \\n103 N.J. at 91-93\\n. As\\n\\nplaintiffs concede, a valid healthcare decision would have nullified their\\n\\nallegation that Valley breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair\\n\\ndealing. The jury was given no law on how to measure Valley’s defense to the\\n\\nimplied covenant claim.\\n\\n      Thus, consideration of the jury charge “as a whole,” Viscik, \\n173 N.J. at\\n\\n18\\n, raises significant doubt as to whether the jury found the underlying\\n\\ncontract for plaintiffs’ implied covenant claim to be some implied or oral\\n\\n                                        51\\n agreement beyond the Bylaws, or just the Bylaws. We reject the contention\\n\\nthat the charge supports the verdict, and we conclude that the jury could have\\n\\ncome to a different result had it been correctly instructed on the contract\\n\\nclaims, especially because the underlying contract on the implied covenant\\n\\nclaim -- purportedly an endless right to treat “unassigned” ER patients with\\n\\nspecial tools -- was not in writing.\\n\\n                                       V.\\n\\n      In this case, the uncertainty created by the jury charge was cumulatively\\n\\nexacerbated by two additional errors: the admission into evidence of privileged\\n\\ncommunications between Goldfischer and Valley; and plaintiffs’ attorney’s\\n\\nimproper summation comments.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      “[T]he applicability of the attorney-client privilege,” including any\\n\\npotential waiver of that privilege, is a legal question which we review de novo.\\n\\nHedden v. Kean Univ., \\n434 N.J. Super. 1\\n, 10 (App. Div. 2013). Therefore, a\\n\\ntrial judge’s “interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow\\n\\nfrom established facts are not entitled to any special deference.” Rowe v. Bell\\n\\n& Gossett Co., \\n239 N.J. 531\\n, 552 (2019) (quoting Manalapan Realty, L.P. v.\\n\\nTwp. Comm. of Manalapan, \\n140 N.J. 366\\n, 378 (1995)).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       52\\n       “[E]nshrined in history and practice,” the attorney-client privilege\\n\\napplies to communications made “by an individual in his capacity as a client”\\n\\nfor the purpose of “seeking or receiving legal advice from the attorney” with\\n\\nan expectation that it remain confidential. Stengart v. Loving Care Agency,\\n\\nInc., \\n201 N.J. 300\\n, 315 (2010). The privilege further applies to\\n\\ncommunications between a corporation’s general counsel and its officers or\\n\\nother “authorized representative[s].” See Macey v. Rollins Env’t Servs. (N.J.),\\n\\nInc., \\n179 N.J. Super. 535\\n, 539-41 (App. Div. 1981) (relying on Upjohn Co. v.\\n\\nUnited States, \\n449 U.S. 383\\n (1981), and holding that “[t]he necessity for full\\n\\nand open disclosure between corporate employees and in-house counsel . . .\\n\\ndemands that all confidential communications be exempt from discovery”);\\n\\nN.J.R.E. 504(3). We have emphasized how “the primary justification and\\n\\ndominant rationale for the” attorney-client privilege is to encourage the “free\\n\\nand full disclosure of information” because “the public is well served by sound\\n\\nlegal counsel based on full and candid communication between attorneys and\\n\\ntheir clients.” Fellerman v. Bradley, \\n99 N.J. 493\\n, 498, 502 (1985).\\n\\n      In this case, Valley sought to claw back a batch of emails totaling 352\\n\\npages it inadvertently produced during expedited discovery. After conducting\\n\\nan in-camera review, the chancery judge generally found that\\n\\n            [t]o the degree that the contested communications were\\n            sent by or to [Goldfischer], the [emails] fall within the\\n                                       53\\n             definition of communications normally protected by the\\n            attorney-client privilege. The court is satisfied that the\\n            [emails] sent to or by [Goldfischer] were made for the\\n            purpose of legal advice rather than business purposes,\\n            as they relate to legal decisions and required the\\n            judgment that one normally exercises in a legal, rather\\n            than a business capacity.\\n\\n      We agree with the chancery judge. Goldfischer dispensed legal advice\\n\\nto Valley’s officers and employees regarding the legal implications of entering\\n\\nan exclusive agreement that would adversely impact plaintiffs. That is what\\n\\nlawyers do and that is exactly what she did here. As Valley’s top lawyer, she\\n\\nunderstood that such an agreement could lead to litigation. Consistent with the\\n\\nrationale for the attorney-client privilege, Goldfischer counseled Valley to\\n\\ndocument its reasons for its actions, analyze the data, and act carefully.\\n\\nGoldfischer’s emails admitted into evidence at trial that were made for the\\n\\npurpose of legal advice, rather than business purposes, are protected by the\\n\\nattorney-client privilege.\\n\\n      Of course, the privilege is not absolute -- a client can waive the attorney-\\n\\nclient privilege by placing legal advice provided by an attorney “in[-]issue.”\\n\\nKinsella v. Kinsella, \\n150 N.J. 276\\n, 300 (1997). In other words, when a party\\n\\nplaces an attorney-client “communication which goes to the heart of the claim\\n\\nin controversy,” as part of their claim or defense, the privilege is waived. \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n(quoting Developments in the Law: Privileged Communications, 98 Harv. L.\\n\\n                                       54\\n Rev. 1450, 1637-38 (1985)). Such would be the case, for example, when a\\n\\nclient produces testimony from an attorney that the client acted on advice of\\n\\ncounsel. In that situation, the client cannot then selectively invoke the\\n\\nprivilege by “divulg[ing] whatever information is favorable to its position[,]\\n\\nand [then] assert the privilege to preclude disclosure of the detrimental facts.”\\n\\nUnited Jersey Bank v. Wolosoff, \\n196 N.J. Super. 553\\n, 567 (App. Div. 1984).\\n\\n      But that is not what happened here. Contrary to the chancery judge’s\\n\\nruling, Valley did not place Goldfischer’s pre-litigation legal advice “in-issue”\\n\\nby relying on the White Paper. Goldfischer had no direct communication with\\n\\nplaintiffs or their attorney; she did not author the White Paper; she did not act\\n\\nas an investigator for the White Paper; and she did not engage in non-legal\\n\\nactivities surrounding the White Paper. And prior to the order allowing\\n\\nplaintiffs to retain privileged emails, Valley never defended against plaintiffs’\\n\\nclaims by producing Goldfischer as a witness.\\n\\n      Our conclusions are further supported by the fact that, as the chancery\\n\\njudge found, plaintiffs could have challenged the merits of the White Paper in\\n\\na “less intrusive manner.” And they did just that. Plaintiffs’ trial counsel\\n\\ncross-examined the analysts and authors of the White Paper and argued to the\\n\\njury that Valley acted in bad faith by attempting to “oust” plaintiffs because\\n\\nthey were disloyal to Valley. Plaintiffs could have done that without any\\n\\n                                        55\\n reference to Goldfischer’s legal advice. Courts should be circumspect to find\\n\\nthe existence of a waiver of the attorney-client privilege when relevant\\n\\ninformation can be secured elsewhere. Doing otherwise would discourage the\\n\\n“free and full disclosure of information from the client to the attorney.”\\n\\nFellerman, \\n99 N.J. at 498\\n.\\n\\n      Further clouding the issue of whether Valley waived the attorney-client\\n\\nprivilege is the fact that Valley inadvertently disclosed the Goldfischer emails\\n\\nduring the whirlwind of what could realistically and fairly be described as an\\n\\nintense court-ordered expedited discovery. It is alleged that approximately\\n\\n57,000 documents were exchanged in roughly two months, including a batch\\n\\nof emails allegedly consisting of 352 pages. During those same two months,\\n\\nfrom the initial return date of the OTSC in late January 2016 to late March\\n\\n2016, Valley’s counsel informed plaintiffs that some documents “got through”\\n\\nand subsequently sent plaintiffs a “claw back” letter pursuant to the parties’\\n\\ndiscovery agreement. That agreement anticipated precisely what occurred\\n\\nhere: the inadvertent release of materials that could lawfully be withheld as\\n\\nprivileged given the massive scope of documents involved and the short\\n\\ntimeframe in which they were exchanged. 12\\n\\n\\n12\\n  N.J.R.E. 530(c)(2) currently provides that “disclosure does not operate as a\\nwaiver in a state proceeding if: (A) the disclosure is inadvertent; (B) the\\n\\n                                       56\\n       Valley’s inadvertent disclosure of the Goldfischer emails, contrary to the\\n\\nchancery judge’s finding, did not amount to waiver. Valley took “reasonable\\n\\nsteps” to prevent disclosure, which in addition to executing the discovery\\n\\nagreement, included designating the emails with varying levels of\\n\\nconfidentiality. Valley’s then-counsel acted carefully considering the\\n\\nexpedited exchange of voluminous written discovery -- where approximately\\n\\n57,000 documents were exchanged in roughly two months.\\n\\n      Admission of the emails into evidence was not harmless. Select\\n\\nGoldfischer emails in many ways became the centerpiece of plaintiffs’ case.\\n\\nIn his opening statement to the jury, plaintiffs’ counsel accused Goldfischer of\\n\\ninvolvement in a “conspiracy to concoct a reason to try to get rid of\\n\\n[plaintiffs].” Plaintiffs’ counsel went on to highlight the privileged emails at\\n\\nlength in his summation. And perhaps most prejudicial of all, plaintiffs were\\n\\n\\n\\nholder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps to prevent\\ndisclosure; and (C) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the\\nerror.” (effective July 1, 2020). At the time of the chancery judge’s decision\\nin this case, N.J.R.E. 530 (July 1, 1993) (codifying N.J.S.A. 2A:84A-29)\\ngoverned disclosure of privileged materials. That provision provided that “[a]\\nperson waives the privilege if she, ‘without coercion and with knowledge of\\n[her] right or privilege, made disclosure of any part of the privileged matter or\\nconsented to such a disclosure made by anyone.’” Stengart, \\n201 N.J. at 323\\n\\n(second alteration in original) (quoting N.J.R.E. 530 (July 1, 1993)). Although\\nwe do not find a waiver under either N.J.R.E. 530 standard, we note that the\\nparties’ focus on inadvertence corresponds more closely to the current\\nstatutory test.\\n                                        57\\n permitted to call Goldfischer as a trial witness where she had to answer\\n\\nquestions about her emails admitted at the trial pertaining to her confidential\\n\\nlegal advice.\\n\\n      Lastly, we note that plaintiffs introduced a handful of the Goldfischer\\n\\nemails at trial. To be sure, her emails containing legal advice should have\\n\\nbeen excluded from admission into evidence. However, the record is unclear\\n\\nwhether the chancery judge conducted a document-by-document review of all\\n\\nthe emails identified in Valley’s claw back letter because of his blanket ruling\\n\\nthat Valley generally waived the attorney-client privilege. On remand, if\\n\\nplaintiffs attempt to introduce into evidence Goldfischer emails containing\\n\\nlegal advice in the 352-page batch that Valley attempted to claw back, we\\n\\ninstruct the remand judge to conduct a document-by-document review to\\n\\ndetermine whether those emails are protected by the attorney-client privilege.\\n\\nIf the remand judge concludes they are protected by the attorney-client\\n\\nprivilege, then those emails will be inadmissible at the remand trial.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      We also find that certain comments by plaintiffs’ trial counsel in\\n\\nsummation were improper. It is well established that “counsel is allowed\\n\\nbroad latitude in summation.” Hayes v. Delamotte, \\n231 N.J. 373\\n, 387 (2018)\\n\\n(quoting Colucci v. Oppenheim, \\n326 N.J. Super. 166\\n, 177 (App. Div. 1999)).\\n\\n                                       58\\n But that latitude is not unlimited: “counsel’s comments must be confined to\\n\\nthe facts shown or reasonably suggested by the evidence introduced during the\\n\\ncourse of the trial.” \\nIbid.\\n Counsel cannot “misstate the evidence [or] distort\\n\\nthe factual picture” -- summation comments “must be based in truth.” Bender\\n\\nv. Adelson, \\n187 N.J. 411\\n, 431 (2006) (quoting Colucci, \\n326 N.J. Super. at\\n\\n177\\n). That includes commenting on the lack of evidence after successfully\\n\\nexcluding such evidence, despite knowing it exists. See, e.g., id. at 433\\n\\n(holding that counsel improperly asked the jury “[w]here are the outside\\n\\nindependent experts in cardiology?” after successfully moving to exclude two\\n\\nexperts).\\n\\n      Since no objections were made to the summation comments, we review\\n\\nfor plain error and reverse only if there was an error that “was ‘clearly capable\\n\\nof producing an unjust result,’ R[ule] 2:10-2; that is, whether there is ‘a\\n\\nreasonable doubt . . . as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise\\n\\nmight not have reached.’” State v. Dunbrack, \\n245 N.J. 531\\n, 544 (2021)\\n\\n(omission in original) (emphasis added) (quoting State v. Funderburg, \\n225 N.J.\\n\\n66\\n, 79 (2016)).\\n\\n      Here, after opening the door by questioning a Valley analyst about\\n\\npatient transfers, plaintiffs’ counsel successfully prevented Valley from cross-\\n\\nexamining that witness on the patient transfers. The trial judge erred by\\n\\n                                        59\\n preventing Valley from introducing this evidence because it tends “to prove or\\n\\ndisprove any fact of consequence to the determination of the action,” N.J.R.E.\\n\\n401 -- namely, to justify the Exclusive Agreement. A challenge to the\\n\\nevidence, specifically the timing of Valley’s discovery of the patient transfers,\\n\\nwould go to its weight, not admissibility.\\n\\n      After this favorable ruling, plaintiffs’ trial counsel surmised to the jury:\\n\\n            [T]here are two instances that they have mentioned that\\n            there was a transferred patient . . .\\n\\n            [D]o you think that if there were more, they would have\\n            presented them to us? Do you think if they existed, they\\n            would have found their way into the [White Paper]?\\n            Because there are none. It isn’t even mentioned in the\\n            [White Paper].\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\nPlaintiffs’ trial counsel knew that Valley had evidence of sixty cases of patient\\n\\ntransfers. The summation remarks implied, however, that there was evidence\\n\\nof only two cases of patient transfers, and that inaccurate statement impacted\\n\\nValley’s contention that it made a valid healthcare decision. The comments\\n\\nimpermissibly “exploited a favorable evidentiary ruling . . . to strike an unfair\\n\\nblow at the defense.” State v. Garcia, \\n245 N.J. 412\\n, 434 (2021). Although on\\n\\ntheir own the remarks might not be “clearly capable of producing an unjust\\n\\nresult,” Rule 2:10-2, we consider the remarks in context with the other\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        60\\n substantial trial errors and hold that an unjust result was clearly capable of\\n\\nbeing reached.\\n\\n                                       VI.\\n\\n      We may reverse a trial court’s judgment and order a new trial when “the\\n\\ncumulative effect of small errors [is] so great as to work prejudice.” Torres v.\\n\\nPabon, \\n225 N.J. 167\\n, 190 (2016) (alteration in original) (quoting Pellicer v. St.\\n\\nBarnabas Hosp., \\n200 N.J. 22\\n, 53 (2009)). In a cumulative error analysis, we\\n\\ndo not merely count the number of mistakes “because even a large number of\\n\\nerrors, if inconsequential, may not operate to create an injustice.” Id. at 191\\n\\n(quoting Pellicer, \\n200 N.J. at 55\\n). Rather, “we consider the aggregate effect of\\n\\nthe trial court’s errors on the fairness of the trial.” \\nIbid.\\n The cumulative errors\\n\\nhere -- by no means inconsequential -- deprived Valley of a fair trial and\\n\\nwarrant a new one.\\n\\n                                       VII.\\n\\n      We offer these final thoughts about the remand proceedings. Valley\\n\\nobtained a no-cause verdict on plaintiffs’ “breach of contract” claim. In other\\n\\nwords, the jury rejected plaintiffs’ claim that they were entitled to a hearing\\n\\nunder the Bylaws. That issue therefore cannot be retried even though, as noted\\n\\nabove, the question of whether Valley violated the Bylaws in altering\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        61\\n plaintiffs’ privileges without a hearing was improperly presented to the jury\\n\\nthrough the instructions and verdict sheet.\\n\\n      On the other hand, the jury must decide, on retrial, whether Valley\\n\\nbreached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing premised on an\\n\\nunderlying contract beyond the rights and obligations afforded by the Bylaws.\\n\\nAnd instructions on Berman and Desai must be given to the jury so that\\n\\nValley’s defense can be fairly considered. If plaintiffs sustain their burden on\\n\\ntheir implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim -- without reference\\n\\nto privileged emails containing legal advice or suggestions about the absence\\n\\nof evidence regarding patient transfers -- money damages are appropriate.\\n\\n                                      VIII.\\n\\n      We reverse the appellate court’s judgment, vacate that part of the verdict\\n\\non the implied covenant claim, and remand for further proceedings consistent\\n\\nwith this opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER APTER, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE FASCIALE’s\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       62\\n '),\n",

Harrell (A-13-23) (088412)\\n\\n(NOTE: The Court did not write a plenary opinion in this case. The Court\\naffirms the judgment of the Appellate Division substantially for the reasons\\nexpressed in Judge Rose’s opinion, 475 N.J. Super. 545 (App. Div. 2023).)\\n\\nArgued February 26, 2024 -- Decided March 26, 2024\\n\\nPER CURIAM\\n\\n      In this appeal, the Court considers the Appellate Division’s determination that\\nthe admission of a child’s entire video-recorded statement at trial does not violate\\nthe Confrontation Clause if the child testifies at trial that she is unable to recall all\\nbut one incident of alleged sexual assault described in the statement.\\n\\n       In March 2016, the then eight-year-old child disclosed to a detective during an\\ninterview that her music teacher, defendant Donnie E. Harrell, touched her “private\\nparts,” buttocks, “and thighs over her clothing on more than one occasion . . . during\\nschool hours.” 475 N.J. Super. 545, 551-52 (App. Div. 2023). She also said that\\n“defendant placed her hand ‘on his private parts’ over his clothing.” Id. at 552.\\nThree years later, in June 2019, a grand jury indicted defendant for sexual assault\\nand endangering the welfare of a child between September 2015 and March 2016. A\\nsuperseding indictment in December 2019 added official misconduct charges.\\n\\n       In October 2021, the trial court granted the State’s motion to admit the child’s\\nentire recorded statement under the “tender years” hearsay exception, N.J.R.E.\\n803(c)(27)(c)(i), finding the statement trustworthy and noting that the child would\\ntestify at trial. While preparing for trial in 2022, the child could “not recall most of\\nthe events she had reported to” the detective six years earlier. 475 N.J. Super. at\\n552. According to the State, the child remembered the incident when “[d]efendant\\ntook her hand and put it on his private part” but “did not recall other incidents.”\\n\\n       After the child testified at a hearing, the trial court granted defendant’s\\nmotion to limit her trial testimony to the one allegation she recalled and directed that\\nthe recorded statement be redacted accordingly. The court found that “the child’s\\nlack of memory rendered her unavailable for cross-examination on the incidents she\\ncould not recall, thereby violating defendant’s right of confrontation.” Id. at 551.\\n                                            1\\n       The Appellate Division reversed, holding that “defendant’s right of\\nconfrontation is not violated by admission of the child’s entire videorecorded\\nstatement under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), previously deemed trustworthy by the court,\\nprovided the victim testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.” Ibid.\\nUnder the Confrontation Clause, testimonial hearsay statements offered against a\\ndefendant in a criminal prosecution are precluded if the defendant does not have the\\nopportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Id. at 558-59. Quoting United States v.\\nOwens, 484 U.S. 554, 558 (1988), the court noted that “[t]he Confrontation Clause\\nincludes no guarantee that every witness called by the prosecution will refrain from\\ngiving testimony that is marred by forgetfulness, confusion, or evasion” but “is\\ngenerally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and\\nexpose these infirmities through cross-examination.” 475 N.J. Super. at 560.\\n\\n       In this case, it is undisputed that the child’s video-recorded statement was\\ntestimonial. Id. at 559. The Appellate Division determined that “defendant’s right\\nof confrontation is not dependent on [the child’s] ability to recall the details, but\\nrather, on defendant’s opportunity to probe her lack of recollection on cross-\\nexamination.” Id. at 564. Because the State intends to call the child as a trial\\nwitness, the Appellate Division stated that the jury can assess her credibility and\\ndetermine what, if any, weight to ascribe to her testimony. Id. at 565.\\n\\n       The Appellate Division also rejected defendant’s evidentiary arguments that\\nthe child’s inability to recall certain alleged incidents meant she lacked the\\nnecessary personal knowledge to testify to those incidents or was unavailable. Id. at\\n565-67. The appellate court concluded that the child’s answers at the pre-trial\\nhearing established she was not unresponsive and recalled some details about the\\nunderlying events. Ibid. The Court granted leave to appeal. 255 N.J. 424 (2023).\\n\\nHELD: The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed substantially for the\\nreasons expressed in Judge Rose’s opinion. The Court adds one additional point.\\n\\n1. Defendant did not challenge the three-year delay between the child’s interview\\nand the return of the original indictment. The Court has no way to assess the reason\\nfor the delay and does not suggest that the delay violated defendant’s rights. A\\nlengthy delay in a future case, however, might prompt a legal challenge. As a result,\\nit is incumbent on the State to act expeditiously as it investigates and prosecutes\\nmatters that rely heavily on a young child’s ability to recall events.

Caroccia, of counsel and on the\\n            brief).\\n\\n\\n                                 PER CURIAM\\n\\n\\n      This appeal involves a challenge to the admissibility of a video-recorded\\n\\nstatement given by a child. A detective interviewed the child in March 2016\\n\\nwhen she was eight years old. She disclosed that her music teacher, defendant\\n\\nDonnie Harrell, touched her “private parts,” buttocks, “and thighs over her\\n\\nclothing on more than one occasion . . . during school hours.” State v. Harrell,\\n\\n475 N.J. Super. 545, 551-52 (App. Div. 2023). She also said that “defendant\\n\\nplaced her hand ‘on his private parts’ over his clothing.” Id. at 552.\\n\\n      Three years later, in June 2019, a grand jury in Union County indicted\\n\\ndefendant on charges of sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child\\n\\nduring the period from September 1, 2015 through March 23, 2016. 1 Six\\n\\nmonths after the initial charges, the grand jury returned a superseding\\n\\nindictment that added official misconduct charges.\\n\\n\\n1\\n  The indictment also contains separate allegations that involve a second\\nvictim. The sexual assault and endangering charges related to the second child\\nfocus on the period from September 1, 2014 through March 23, 2016. Those\\ncharges are not part of this appeal.\\n                                      2\\n       In April 2020, the State moved to admit the child’s statements under the\\n\\n“tender years” exception to the hearsay rule, N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27)(c)(i). After\\n\\nan evidentiary hearing conducted during the pandemic, in 2021, the trial court\\n\\nissued a detailed written opinion and granted the motion.\\n\\n      While preparing for trial in the summer of 2022, the child could “not\\n\\nrecall most of the events she had reported to” the detective six years earlier.\\n\\nHarrell, 475 N.J. Super. at 552. The prosecution notified defense counsel of\\n\\nthe development by letter. According to the State, the child remembered the\\n\\nincident when “[d]efendant took her hand and put it on his private part” but\\n\\n“did not recall other incidents of sexual conduct.”\\n\\n      Defendant then moved to limit the child’s testimony at trial. After a\\n\\nhearing at which the child testified, the trial court granted the motion. The\\n\\ncourt concluded that “the child’s lack of memory rendered her unavailable for\\n\\ncross-examination on the incidents she could not recall, thereby violating\\n\\ndefendant’s right of confrontation.” Id. at 551. The court therefore limited her\\n\\ntestimony to the one allegation she recalled and directed that the video-\\n\\nrecorded statement be redacted accordingly. Id. at 550-51.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division reversed. It held that “defendant’s right of\\n\\nconfrontation is not violated by admission of the child’s entire videorecorded\\n\\nstatement under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(27), previously deemed trustworthy by the\\n\\n                                        3\\n court, provided the victim testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.”\\n\\nId. at 551. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division substantially for\\n\\nthe reasons expressed in Judge Rose’s thoughtful opinion.\\n\\n      We add one additional point. It is no surprise that a young child may\\n\\nhave difficulty remembering a traumatic episode alleged to have taken place\\n\\nyears earlier. Cf. State v. Henderson, 208 N.J. 208, 267 (2011) (discussing\\n\\nmemory decay). In this case, more than three years elapsed between the date\\n\\nthe detective interviewed the child and the return of the original indictment.\\n\\nDefendant did not challenge the delay, and we have no way to assess the\\n\\nreason for it. Nor do we suggest that the delay here violated defendant’s\\n\\nrights. A lengthy delay in a future case, however, might prompt a legal\\n\\nchallenge. As a result, it is incumbent on the State to act expeditiously as it\\n\\ninvestigates and prosecutes matters that rely heavily on a young child’s ability\\n\\nto recall events.\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in this\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        4\\n '),\n",

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey v. County Prosecutors Association\\n                        of New Jersey (A-33-22) (087789)\\n\\nArgued October 10, 2023 -- Decided April 17, 2024\\n\\nPATTERSON, J., writing for the Court.\\n\\n      In this appeal, the Court considers whether defendant the County Prosecutors\\nAssociation of New Jersey (CPANJ) is a public agency required to disclose records\\npursuant to the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 to -13, and a\\npublic entity subject to the common law right of access.\\n\\n       CPANJ is a nonprofit association whose members are the twenty-one county\\nprosecutors. It has no employees or office. The ACLU asserts that CPANJ\\n“regularly sends copies of its meeting minutes and agendas” to the Office of the\\nAttorney General and that the county prosecutors who comprise the membership of\\nCPANJ use the resources of their offices to conduct CPANJ business, including “the\\ndevelopment of agendas, the coordination of meetings and dinners, and the\\nadministration of [CPANJ’s] scholarship program.” The ACLU states that CPANJ\\nparticipates as amicus curiae in trial and appellate matters and that it has filed\\nappearances in court. The ACLU asserts that CPANJ uses county prosecutors’\\nresources when it participates in court proceedings as amicus curiae.\\n\\n       On July 19, 2019, the ACLU served a records request on CPANJ’s president\\npursuant to OPRA and the common law right of access. CPANJ denied the request,\\nstating that it was “quite simply not a public agency” as that term is defined by\\nN.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. CPANJ also denied the ACLU’s request for disclosure of the\\nrecords pursuant to the common law right of access.\\n\\n       The ACLU filed this action, alleging that CPANJ is a public agency under\\nN.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 because it is “an instrumentality created by a combination of\\npolitical subdivisions to facilitate cooperation between government agencies and\\nother political subdivisions.” The ACLU also asserted that the requested documents\\nare public records subject to public access under the common law.\\n\\n      The trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that CPANJ is not a public\\nagency within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 and that, because CPANJ’s\\n                                          1\\n records were not created under authority granted independently to each county\\nprosecutor, they do not constitute public records for purposes of the common law\\nright of access. The Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of the ACLU’s\\nOPRA claims, and it concurred with the trial court’s rejection of the ACLU’s\\ncommon law right of access argument but on different grounds -- namely, that\\nCPANJ is not a public entity and is therefore not subject to the common law right of\\naccess. \\n474 N.J. Super. 243\\n, 268-72 (App. Div. 2022). The Court granted\\ncertification. \\n253 N.J. 396\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: CPANJ is neither a public agency under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 nor a public\\nentity subject to the common law right of access. The ACLU’s factual allegations\\ndo not support a claim against CPANJ under OPRA or the common law.\\n\\n1. OPRA applies only if the entity to which a request is directed meets the statutory\\ndefinition of a public agency. For purposes of OPRA, the terms “public agency” or\\n“agency” denote the entities specified in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, which include “any\\npolitical subdivision of the State or combination of political subdivisions, and any\\ndivision, board, bureau, office, commission or other instrumentality within or\\ncreated by a political subdivision of the State or combination of political\\nsubdivisions, and any independent authority, commission, instrumentality or agency\\ncreated by a political subdivision or combination of political subdivisions.” The\\nterm “political subdivision” denotes a division of a state that exists primarily to\\ndischarge some function of local government, such as a county or municipality, as\\nwell as certain entities formed by counties and municipalities, such as parking\\nauthorities. The ACLU argues that CPANJ is an instrumentality of the county\\nprosecutors. Accordingly, the core question in this appeal is whether a county\\nprosecutor constitutes a “political subdivision” for purposes of OPRA. (pp. 14-22)\\n\\n2. A county is indisputably a “political subdivision of the State” as defined in\\nOPRA, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. The status of the counties themselves as political\\nsubdivisions under OPRA, however, has no bearing on the analysis. A county\\nprosecutor is distinct from the county that the prosecutor serves for purposes of\\nOPRA’s reach. A county prosecutor, like the Attorney General, is a constitutional\\nofficer who serves by virtue of gubernatorial nomination and Senate confirmation.\\nAlthough a county exercises considerable control over the fiscal operations of the\\ncounty prosecutor’s office, a county prosecutor’s law enforcement function is\\nunsupervised by county government or any other agency of local government. In\\nshort, the county prosecutor is not the alter ego of the county itself, and does not\\nconstitute a “political subdivision” as that term is used in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1.\\nCPANJ, meanwhile, constitutes an organization in which the county prosecutors are\\nmembers and is not the alter ego of the prosecutors themselves. Because a\\nprosecutor does not meet the definition of a “political subdivision” under N.J.S.A.\\n47:1A-1.1’s plain language, CPANJ is not a public agency for purposes of OPRA.\\n                                          2\\n The ACLU’s factual allegations do not support its assertion that CPANJ is a public\\nagency within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. Because the ACLU did not seek\\nthe documents from a public agency in accordance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5 and -6, the\\nCourt does not reach the question whether the documents identified in its request\\nconstitute “government records” under OPRA. (pp. 22-26)\\n\\n3. A public record under the common law is one that is made by a public official in\\nthe exercise of the official’s public function, either because the record was required\\nor directed by law to be made or kept, or because it was filed in a public office.\\nHere, the ACLU identifies no statute, regulation, or other mandate requiring CPANJ\\nto create or maintain the requested documents. It suggests no statutory or regulatory\\nmandates of any kind addressing the records at issue. The ACLU does not allege\\nthat CPANJ maintains public documents in a public office; indeed, it does not\\ndispute CPANJ’s assertion that it maintains no office at all. The ACLU identifies no\\nprecedential decision discussing, let alone upholding, a request for public documents\\nserved on a private entity such as CPANJ. In short, the ACLU asserts no factual\\nallegations that would suggest that CPANJ constitutes an entity upon which a\\ncommon law right of access request for documents may properly be served. The\\nCourt does not reach the question whether the documents that the ACLU requested\\nfrom CPANJ would be considered common law public documents if requested from\\na public entity. (pp. 26-29)\\n\\n      AFFIRMED.\\n\\n       JUSTICE WAINER APTER, dissenting, expresses the view that the facts\\nalleged about CPANJ, taken in the light most favorable to the ACLU, suggest that\\nCPANJ is simply another name for the county prosecutors themselves and that it\\ntherefore meets the definition of “public agency” in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 in the same\\nway that the county prosecutors’ offices themselves do. Looking behind CPANJ’s\\ntechnical form, and construing OPRA “in favor of the public’s right of access,”\\nN.J.S.A. 47:1A-1, Justice Wainer Apter would hold that the trial court erred in\\ngranting CPANJ’s motion to dismiss the ACLU’s OPRA claim. In addition, Justice\\nWainer Apter writes, because no private citizens are members of CPANJ, every\\ndocument recorded, generated, or produced by CPANJ is recorded, generated, or\\nproduced by a public official and, because CPANJ maintains all documents in the\\ncounty prosecutors’ offices -- which are public offices under the common law --\\nCPANJ documents are by definition common law public records. Justice Wainer\\nApter would therefore hold that the trial court also erred in dismissing the ACLU’s\\nclaim under the common law.\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES SOLOMON, PIERRE-LOUIS, and\\nFASCIALE join in JUSTICE PATTERSON’s opinion.

CPANJ denied the request, asserting that it is not a public\\n\\n                                         2\\n agency for purposes of OPRA and is not a public entity subject to the common\\n\\nlaw right of access. The ACLU filed this action, seeking an order compelling\\n\\nproduction of the requested documents and other relief.\\n\\n      The trial court granted CPANJ’s motion to dismiss the complaint\\n\\npursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e). The ACLU appealed that determination, and the\\n\\nAppellate Division affirmed the trial court’s judgment. The appellate court\\n\\nfound that the ACLU’s factual allegations did not support its contention that\\n\\nCPANJ is a public agency under OPRA or its assertion that CPANJ is a public\\n\\nentity subject to the common law. ACLU of N.J. v. Cnty. Prosecutors Ass’n of\\n\\nN.J., \\n474 N.J. Super. 243\\n, 256-72 (App. Div. 2022).\\n\\n      We concur with the Appellate Division that CPANJ is neither a public\\n\\nagency under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 nor a public entity subject to the common\\n\\nlaw right of access. We conclude that the ACLU’s factual allegations do not\\n\\nsupport a claim against CPANJ under OPRA or the common law.\\n\\nAccordingly, we affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment.\\n\\n                                       I.\\n\\n                                      A.\\n\\n                                       1.\\n\\n      We summarize the ACLU’s factual allegations based on the complaint\\n\\nand its attachments.\\n\\n                                       3\\n       CPANJ is a nonprofit association operating pursuant to Internal Revenue\\n\\nCode § 501(c)(3). Its members are the twenty-one county prosecutors.\\n\\nAccording to CPANJ’s 2015 and 2016 Internal Revenue Service disclosure\\n\\nforms, attached to the ACLU’s complaint, the organization’s mission is to\\n\\n“maintain close cooperation between the Attorney General of the State of New\\n\\nJersey, the Division of Criminal Justice of the State of New Jersey and the\\n\\ntwenty-one (21) county prosecutors of the State of New Jersey,” relating to\\n\\n“developing educational programs so as to promote the orderly administration\\n\\nof criminal justice within the State of New Jersey, consistent with the\\n\\nConstitution and the laws of the State of New Jersey.” CPANJ represented in\\n\\nthose disclosure forms that it does not compensate its members, who\\n\\nparticipate as volunteers; that it obtains revenue solely from membership dues,\\n\\nmembership assessments, and educational conferences; that it grants\\n\\nscholarships to law students; and that it has no employees or office.\\n\\n      Citing a 1985 joint policy statement between the New Jersey Attorney\\n\\nGeneral and CPANJ regarding prosecutorial review of search warrant\\n\\napplications, as well as CPANJ’s involvement in a 2018 initiative to stop\\n\\nviolence against women, the ACLU alleged in its complaint that the Office of\\n\\nthe Attorney General views CPANJ as a “partner in implementing statewide\\n\\ncriminal justice policy.” The ACLU noted that pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:17B-\\n\\n                                       4\\n 70(b), CPANJ’s representative is a member of the Department of Law and\\n\\nPublic Safety Police Training Commission, and that under N.J.S.A. 30:4-\\n\\n123.47a, CPANJ’s representative is a member of the Parole Advisory Board.\\n\\nThe ACLU asserted that CPANJ “regularly sends copies of its meeting minutes\\n\\nand agendas” to the Office of the Attorney General.\\n\\n      The ACLU further alleged in its complaint that the county prosecutors\\n\\nwho comprise the membership of CPANJ use the resources of their offices to\\n\\nconduct CPANJ business, including “the development of agendas, the\\n\\ncoordination of meetings and dinners, and the administration of [CPANJ’s]\\n\\nscholarship program.” The ACLU stated that CPANJ participates as amicus\\n\\ncuriae in trial and appellate matters and that it has filed appearances in court.\\n\\nThe ACLU asserted that CPANJ uses county prosecutors’ resources when it\\n\\nparticipates in court proceedings as amicus curiae.\\n\\n                                        2.\\n\\n      On July 19, 2019, the ACLU served a records request on CPANJ’s\\n\\npresident pursuant to OPRA and the common law right of access. The ACLU\\n\\nrequested five categories of records for the period between January 1, 2017,\\n\\nand July 19, 2019: (1) CPANJ meeting agendas; (2) CPANJ meeting minutes;\\n\\n(3) records reflecting funding received by CPANJ; (4) briefs filed in state or\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         5\\n federal courts by CPANJ; and (5) policies or practices shared with county\\n\\nprosecutors through CPANJ.\\n\\n      By letter sent from its president to the ACLU on September 18, 2019,\\n\\nCPANJ denied the request. CPANJ stated that it was “quite simply not a\\n\\npublic agency” as that term is defined by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, and that it\\n\\ninstead constitutes “a private association” comprised of the twenty-one county\\n\\nprosecutors. It asserted that its goal is to promote “the orderly administration\\n\\nof criminal justice within the State” and “the fair and effective enforcement”\\n\\nof New Jersey’s Constitution and laws “through the cooperation of all law\\n\\nenforcement agencies.” CPANJ further contended that even if it were to meet\\n\\nOPRA’s definition of a public agency, the requested records would be exempt\\n\\nfrom disclosure on confidentiality grounds, as inter-agency advisory,\\n\\nconsultative, or deliberative materials, or as records pertaining to a criminal\\n\\ninvestigation or related civil enforcement proceeding that are not “required by\\n\\nlaw to be made, maintained or kept on file.” It took the position that it could\\n\\nnot comply with the ACLU’s OPRA request because it lacked “a physical\\n\\noffice, location or even an online presence.”\\n\\n      CPANJ also denied the ACLU’s request for disclosure of the records\\n\\npursuant to the common law right of access. Maintaining that the ACLU had\\n\\nfailed to identify its interest in the request for purposes of the common law\\n\\n                                        6\\n balancing analysis, CPANJ contended in its response to the ACLU’s request\\n\\nthat it was not subject to the common law right of access and that the requested\\n\\ndocuments did not meet the common law definition of a public document.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n                                       1.\\n\\n      The ACLU filed this action, alleging that CPANJ is a public agency\\n\\nunder N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 because it is “an instrumentality created by a\\n\\ncombination of political subdivisions to facilitate cooperation between\\n\\ngovernment agencies and other political subdivisions.” The ACLU also\\n\\nasserted that the requested documents are public records subject to public\\n\\naccess under the common law. It sought a declaratory judgment stating that\\n\\nCPANJ is subject to OPRA and the common law, and that CPANJ violated the\\n\\nlaw by rejecting the ACLU’s request for documents. The ACLU also\\n\\nrequested an injunction requiring production of the disputed documents, or, in\\n\\nthe alternative, an in camera review of those documents followed by\\n\\ndisclosure. It sought an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.\\n\\n      CPANJ filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a\\n\\nclaim pursuant to ----\\n                  Rule 4:6-2(e). It asserted that it is not a public agency under\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 and is not subject to the common law right of access.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        7\\n       The trial court held that CPANJ is not a public agency within the\\n\\nmeaning of N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. It rejected the ACLU’s claim that because\\n\\ncounty prosecutors comprise CPANJ’s membership, CPANJ cooperates with\\n\\nthe Attorney General on certain law enforcement issues, and CPANJ is\\n\\nrepresented in the governing bodies of certain public organizations, it should\\n\\nbe viewed as a public agency for purposes of OPRA. The trial court found that\\n\\nCPANJ’s amicus curiae appearances, which further the orderly administration\\n\\nof criminal justice, do not support the ACLU’s contention that CPANJ is a\\n\\npublic agency under OPRA.\\n\\n      The trial court also found that because CPANJ’s records were not\\n\\ncreated under authority granted independently to each county prosecutor, they\\n\\ndo not constitute public records for purposes of the common law right of\\n\\naccess. The court noted that although county prosecutors are invited to join\\n\\nCPANJ, they are not required to do so, and that membership in the\\n\\norganization is not mandated in order for prosecutors to fulfill their public\\n\\nfunction.\\n\\n      The trial court entered an order dismissing the complaint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        8\\n                                         2.\\n\\n      The ACLU appealed the trial court’s judgment. 1 The Appellate Division\\n\\ngranted amicus curiae status to Libertarians for Transparent Government.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division agreed with the trial court that CPANJ does not\\n\\nconstitute a public agency as the Legislature defined the term in N.J.S.A.\\n\\n47:1A-1. ACLU, 474 N.J. Super. at 257-68. The appellate court\\n\\nacknowledged that a county is a political subdivision of the State under OPRA,\\n\\nbut rejected the contention that CPANJ was created by a combination of\\n\\npolitical subdivisions, given the absence of any evidence “that the counties\\n\\ndirectly created CPANJ or authorized its creation.” Id. at 261. The Appellate\\n\\nDivision recognized the distinction between a county and a county prosecutor,\\n\\nwho is a constitutional officer and “the foremost representative of the\\n\\nexecutive branch of government in law enforcement in [the] county.” Id. at\\n\\n262 (quoting Cherrits v. Ridgewood, \\n311 N.J. Super. 517\\n, 528-29 (App. Div.\\n\\n1998)). The appellate court concluded that “any entity created by the county\\n\\nprosecutors is, at most, an instrumentality of instrumentalities or of offices,”\\n\\nand that such an entity is not a public agency under OPRA. Id. at 263-64. The\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  The Appellate Division rejected a challenge by CPANJ to the court’s\\njurisdiction to determine whether CPANJ is subject to OPRA. 474 N.J.

City of Hoboken, \\n196 N.J. 51\\n, 64 (2008)).\\n\\n      Consistent with that legislative goal, OPRA applies only if the entity to\\n\\nwhich a request is directed meets the statutory definition of a public agency.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 47:1A-1, -6; see also Fair Share Hous.

Pennsauken Sewerage Auth., \\n15 N.J. 456\\n, 470 (1954); see also\\n\\nVerry, 230 N.J. at 297 (noting that a municipality is a political subdivision of\\n\\nthe State “and has long been understood as such”) (citing City of Jersey City v.\\n\\nMartin, \\n126 N.J.L. 353\\n, 361 (E. & A. 1941))); Headen v.

Corp. v. Lafayette Yard Community\\n\\nDevelopment Corp., we concluded that defendant Lafayette Yard Community\\n\\nDevelopment Corporation, a nonprofit corporation created to oversee a\\n\\nredevelopment project on donated property in the City of Trenton, was a public\\n\\nagency for purposes of OPRA. \\n183 N.J. 519\\n, 534-36 (2005). Noting that\\n\\nTrenton’s Mayor and City Council had “absolute control over the\\n\\n                                       18\\n membership” of the corporation’s board of trustees and that the corporation\\n\\n“could only have been ‘created’ with their approval,” we deemed the\\n\\ncorporation to be “an ‘instrumentality or agency created by a political\\n\\nsubdivision’ under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1.’” \\nId. at 534-35\\n.\\n\\n      In Fair Share Housing, we applied OPRA’s definition of a public agency\\n\\nto the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, “a nonprofit, unincorporated\\n\\nassociation, today representing all of New Jersey’s 566 municipalities.” \\n207\\n\\nN.J. at 494\\n. Noting the League’s role in promoting the municipalities’\\n\\ninterests in the Legislature and in educating local officials, we concluded that\\n\\nthe League “is achieving an end and providing a function on behalf of all 566\\n\\nof New Jersey’s municipalities.” \\nId. at 503-04\\n. Because each municipality\\n\\nconstitutes a “political subdivision of the State” under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, and\\n\\nthe League of Municipalities is an “instrumentality” under OPRA, we held that\\n\\nthe League “is an ‘instrumentality’ of a ‘combination of political\\n\\nsubdivisions,’” and thus a public agency under OPRA. \\nId. at 504\\n.\\n\\n      In Verry, we considered OPRA’s applicability to two distinct entities:\\n\\nthe Franklin Fire District No. 1, a fire district established pursuant to N.J.S.A.\\n\\n40A:14-70, and the Millstone Valley Fire Department, a nonprofit volunteer\\n\\nfire department that was a member of the Fire District. 230 N.J. at 296-302.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        19\\n       We found in Verry that Franklin Fire District No. 1 constituted a public\\n\\nagency under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 because it was the “creation of a\\n\\nmunicipality,” which in turn was “undoubtedly a political subdivision” that\\n\\nhad exercised statutory authority to form the Fire District. Id. at 298-99. We\\n\\ntherefore deemed the Fire District to be “an instrumentality of a political\\n\\nsubdivision,” thus satisfying “the definition of public agency under the second\\n\\nsentence of OPRA’s definition.” Id. at 299 (citing N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1).\\n\\n      We reached the opposite conclusion with respect to the volunteer fire\\n\\ndepartment, however. Id. at 299-302. Noting that N.J.S.A. 40A:14-70.1\\n\\nauthorizes a fire district to create or contract with volunteer fire companies, we\\n\\nconcluded that “a volunteer squad may be regarded as an instrumentality of a\\n\\nfire district.” Id. at 300-01. We observed that\\n\\n            because the District itself is not a political subdivision,\\n            but rather the instrumentality of one, the volunteer\\n            company is only the instrumentality of an\\n            instrumentality. Although OPRA provides that an\\n            instrumentality of a political subdivision constitutes a\\n            public agency, it does not provide that an\\n            instrumentality of an instrumentality constitutes a\\n            public agency. OPRA requires a direct connection to a\\n            political subdivision.\\n\\n            [Id. at 301 (citing N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1).]\\n\\n      We also clarified language in our jurisprudence relying on “‘creation’ or\\n\\n‘governmental-function’ tests when demarcating the boundaries of what\\n\\n                                        20\\n qualifies as a public agency.” Id. at 302 (citing League of Muns., \\n207 N.J. at\\n\\n507\\n). Observing that “such tests are useful only insomuch as they effectuate\\n\\napplication of the statutory language,” we reiterated that the plain language of\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 established that the District, an instrumentality of a\\n\\npolitical subdivision, is a public agency subject to OPRA, and that the\\n\\nvolunteer company, although supervised by the District, “is not a public\\n\\nagency as defined by OPRA.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                       2.\\n\\n      Guided by OPRA’s plain language and our prior case law construing that\\n\\nlanguage, and assuming the truth of the ACLU’s factual allegations in\\n\\naccordance with Rule 4:6-2(e), we consider the ACLU’s argument that CPANJ\\n\\nis a public agency as defined by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. 3 We conduct a fact-\\n\\nsensitive inquiry, “look[ing] behind the technical form” of the entity at issue\\n\\n“to consider its substantive attributes.” Paff v. State Firemen’s Ass’n, \\n431 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 278\\n, 288 (App. Div. 2013).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  The factual allegations that a court must assume to be true in a motion to\\ndismiss under Rule 4:6-2 are the allegations set forth in the complaint. See,\\ne.g., Dimitrakopoulos, \\n237 N.J. at 107\\n; Printing Mart, 16 N.J. at 746. A\\nparty’s factual assertions in a trial brief, in an appellate brief, or at oral\\nargument, and the factual contentions of an amicus curiae, however, are not\\nassumed to be true for purposes the court’s inquiry. See ibid.\\n\\n                                       21\\n       The ACLU urges us to find that CPANJ is an instrumentality of the\\n\\ncounty prosecutors, “state actors” who together comprise a “combination of\\n\\npolitical subdivisions” under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. Accordingly, the core\\n\\nquestion in this appeal is whether a county prosecutor constitutes a “political\\n\\nsubdivision” for purposes of OPRA. 4\\n\\n      A county is indisputably a “political subdivision of the State” as defined\\n\\nin OPRA, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1; accord Camden County, 15 N.J. at 470. The\\n\\nstatus of the counties themselves as political subdivisions under OPRA,\\n\\nhowever, has no bearing on the analysis. As the Appellate Division observed,\\n\\n“[n]othing in the record before us suggests that the counties directly created\\n\\nCPANJ or authorized its creation.” ACLU, 474 N.J. Super. at 261. Indeed,\\n\\nthe ACLU’s complaint is devoid of any allegation that the counties themselves\\n\\ncreated CPANJ, or have ever controlled its operations. The ACLU’s\\n\\nallegations center entirely on the county prosecutors’ authority over CPANJ.\\n\\n      A county prosecutor is distinct from the county that the prosecutor\\n\\nserves for purposes of OPRA’s reach. Our State Constitution provides that\\n\\n“[c]ounty prosecutors shall be nominated and appointed by the Governor with\\n\\nthe advice and consent of the Senate,” that the prosecutors’ “term of office\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n The parties agree that the county prosecutors themselves are subject to\\nOPRA.\\n                                      22\\n shall be five years,” and that the prosecutors “shall serve until the appointment\\n\\nand qualification of their respective successors.” N.J. Const. art. VII, § 2, ¶ 1.\\n\\nIn accord with the constitutional provisions governing county prosecutors, the\\n\\nLegislature has determined that\\n\\n            [t]here shall be appointed, for each county, by the\\n            governor with the advice and consent of the senate to\\n            serve for a term of 5 years and until the appointment\\n            and qualification of his successor, some fit person who\\n            shall have been admitted to the practice of law in this\\n            state for at least 5 years, who shall be known as the\\n            county prosecutor and who, except as otherwise\\n            provided by law, shall prosecute the pleas of the state\\n            in such county and shall have all of the powers and\\n            perform all of the duties formerly had and performed\\n            by the prosecutor of the pleas of such county. As the\\n            term of the prosecutor of the pleas of any county shall\\n            expire there shall be appointed in his place and stead\\n            such county prosecutor.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 2A:158-1.]\\n\\n      Accordingly, a county prosecutor, like the Attorney General, is a\\n\\nconstitutional officer who serves by virtue of gubernatorial nomination and\\n\\nSenate confirmation. Morss v. Forbes, \\n24 N.J. 341\\n, 369 (1957). “[C]ounty\\n\\nprosecutors occupy a ‘hybrid’ role, serving both the county and the State . . . .”\\n\\nGramiccioni v. Dep’t of Law & Pub. Safety, \\n243 N.J. 293\\n, 310 (2020).\\n\\nAlthough a “county exercises considerable control over the fiscal operations of\\n\\nthe county prosecutor’s office,” a county prosecutor’s “‘law enforcement\\n\\nfunction is unsupervised by county government or any other agency of local\\n                                        23\\n government.’” Yurick v. State, \\n184 N.J. 70\\n, 80 (2005) (quoting Wright v.\\n\\nState, \\n169 N.J. 422\\n, 452 (2001)). In short, the county prosecutor is not the\\n\\nalter ego of the county itself, and does not constitute a “political subdivision”\\n\\nas that term is used in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1.\\n\\n      The ACLU’s reliance on CPANJ’s law enforcement functions and\\n\\nrelationship with the Attorney General is misplaced; because a prosecutor does\\n\\nnot meet the definition of a “political subdivision” under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1’s\\n\\nplain language, CPANJ’s role in law enforcement does not confer on it public\\n\\nagency status for purposes of OPRA. See Verry, 230 N.J. at 302 (noting that\\n\\n“creation” or “governmental-function” tests in determining public agency\\n\\nstatus under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 are “useful only insomuch as they effectuate\\n\\napplication of the statutory language”). The ACLU does not allege facts\\n\\nsuggesting that CPANJ is a public agency in accordance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-\\n\\n1.1’s plain language. The terms of the statute control.\\n\\n      Notwithstanding the contention of our dissenting colleagues, CPANJ has\\n\\nnot identified itself as the organizational shorthand of the county prosecutors;\\n\\nto the contrary, it stresses the distinctions between itself and the county\\n\\nprosecutors. See post at ___ (slip op. at 9-12). Those distinctions are\\n\\nfundamental. A county prosecutor, a constitutional officer, is “statutorily\\n\\nendowed with powers that arm him or her to perform wide ranging\\n\\n                                        24\\n duties.” Yurick, \\n184 N.J. at\\n78-79 (citing Wright, \\n169 N.J. at 437\\n). A\\n\\nprosecutor “shall be vested with the same powers and be subject to the same\\n\\npenalties, within his county, as the attorney general shall by law be vested with\\n\\nor subject to,” and “shall use all reasonable and lawful diligence for the\\n\\ndetection, arrest, indictment and conviction of offenders against the\\n\\nlaws.” N.J.S.A. 2A:158-5. CPANJ, in contrast, has no constitutional or\\n\\nstatutory powers of any kind, and it is not authorized to investigate, arrest, or\\n\\nprosecute anyone. It constitutes an organization in which the county\\n\\nprosecutors are members. It is not the alter ego of the prosecutors\\n\\nthemselves. 5\\n\\n      We therefore concur with the Appellate Division that the ACLU’s\\n\\nfactual allegations do not support its assertion that CPANJ is a public agency\\n\\nwithin the meaning of N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. The Appellate Division properly\\n\\naffirmed the dismissal of the ACLU’s OPRA claim pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e).\\n\\nBecause the ACLU did not seek the documents from a public agency in\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  Indeed, county prosecutors sometimes disagree with one another with respect\\nto criminal justice issues. See, e.g., State v. Gomes, \\n253 N.J. 4\\n, 12-14, 34\\n(2023) (noting that the county prosecutors in the two cases before the Court\\nhad taken opposing positions with respect to the question whether individuals\\nwho received conditional discharges for marijuana offenses prior to the\\nLegislature’s adoption of the Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance,\\nand Marketplace Modernization Act, N.J.S.A. 24:61-32 to -56, are statutorily\\nineligible for admission into the pretrial intervention program).\\n                                         25\\n accordance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5 and -6, we do not reach the question\\n\\nwhether the documents identified in its request constitute “government\\n\\nrecords” under OPRA as defined in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, or whether those\\n\\ndocuments are within one or more OPRA exemptions.\\n\\n      Our decision affirming the dismissal of the ACLU’s OPRA claim against\\n\\nCPANJ does not preclude the ACLU from requesting the same categories of\\n\\ndocuments from one or more public agencies subject to OPRA.\\n\\n                                       C.\\n\\n      We next consider the Appellate Division’s decision affirming the trial\\n\\ncourt’s dismissal of the ACLU’s common law right of access claim.\\n\\n                                       1.\\n\\n      Long before the Legislature codified the right of access to certain public\\n\\ndocuments, we recognized “that citizens have [a] common law right ‘to require\\n\\ncustodians of public records to make them available for reasonable inspection\\n\\nand examination.’” Tarus v. Borough of Pine Hill, \\n189 N.J. 497\\n, 507 (2007)\\n\\n(quoting Irval Realty Inc. v. Bd. of Pub. Util. Comm’rs, \\n61 N.J. 366\\n, 372\\n\\n(1972)). The common law determination raises an issue distinct from the\\n\\nstatutory construction that governs our analysis of the ACLU’s OPRA claim.\\n\\n“Although both paths raise similar considerations, OPRA does not limit the\\n\\nright of access to government records under the common law.” Rivera v.\\n\\n                                       26\\n Union Cnty.

Hyland, \\n76 N.J. 213\\n, 222 (1978)). A\\n\\npublic record under the common law “is one that is made by a public official\\n\\nin the exercise of [the official’s] public function, either because the record was\\n\\nrequired or directed by law to be made or kept, or because it was filed in a\\n\\npublic office.” Keddie, \\n148 N.J. at 49\\n.\\n\\n      To access public documents under the common law, “requestors must\\n\\nmake a greater showing than required under OPRA: (1) ‘the person seeking\\n\\naccess must “establish an interest in the subject matter of the material”’; and\\n\\n(2) ‘the citizen’s right to access “must be balanced against the State’s interest\\n\\nin preventing disclosure.”’” Mason, \\n196 N.J. at 67-68\\n (quoting Keddie, \\n148\\n\\nN.J. at 50\\n)). We have identified factors to guide that determination. See\\n\\n                                        27\\n Rivera, \\n229 N.J. at 144-49\\n (identifying factors addressing a common-law\\n\\nrequest for police internal affairs materials); Loigman v.

Super. at 269. In factual allegations that we assume\\n\\nto be true for purposes of CPANJ’s motion to dismiss under Rule 4:6-2(e), the\\n\\nACLU asserts that CPANJ identifies itself in its disclosure forms as a\\n\\nnonprofit, tax-exempt, unstaffed organization with a governing body\\n\\ncomprised of seven voting members. The ACLU identifies no statute,\\n\\nregulation, or other mandate requiring CPANJ to create or maintain the\\n\\ndocuments in dispute. It suggests no statutory or regulatory mandates of any\\n\\nkind addressing the records at issue. The ACLU does not allege that CPANJ\\n\\nmaintains public documents in a public office; indeed, it does not dispute\\n\\nCPANJ’s assertion that it maintains no office at all. The ACLU identifies no\\n\\nprecedential decision discussing, let alone upholding, a request for public\\n\\ndocuments served on a private entity such as CPANJ. In short, the ACLU\\n\\nasserts no factual allegations that would suggest that CPANJ constitutes an\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        28\\n entity upon which a common law right of access request for documents may\\n\\nproperly be served.\\n\\n      We agree with the Appellate Division’s conclusion that “CPANJ is not a\\n\\npublic entity subject to the common law right of access” and that it\\n\\naccordingly “was not required to provide the requested documents” to the\\n\\nACLU. Id. at 271. We concur with the appellate court’s determination that\\n\\nthe trial court properly dismissed the ACLU’s common law claims.\\n\\n      We do not reach the question whether the documents that the ACLU\\n\\nrequested from CPANJ would be considered common law public documents if\\n\\nrequested from a public entity subject to the common law right of access. 6 Nor\\n\\ndo we conduct the balancing test required if a public entity disputes a common\\n\\nlaw request for access to public documents. If the ACLU serves a request for\\n\\nthe documents at issue in this appeal on one or more public entities subject to\\n\\nthe common law right of access, and that request is denied, the ACLU may\\n\\nassert a claim against that entity under the common law.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n  Our dissenting colleagues state that any CPANJ documents stored at the\\ncounty prosecutors’ offices constitute common law public records.

CPANJ has no staff; its work is completed by the county\\n\\nprosecutors themselves, or by employees of the county prosecutors’ offices\\n\\nacross the state, including assistant prosecutors. It has no office; its documents\\n\\nare maintained in the county prosecutors’ offices. And CPANJ receives no\\n\\nprivate funding; it is funded only through government funding sources.\\n\\n      Taken in the light most favorable to the ACLU, as we must on a motion\\n\\nto dismiss under Rule 4:6-2(e), those facts at least suggest that CPANJ is\\n\\nsimply another name for the county prosecutors themselves and that it\\n therefore meets the definition of “public agency” in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1 in the\\n\\nsame way that the county prosecutors’ offices themselves do.\\n\\n      Looking behind CPANJ’s technical form, and construing the Open\\n\\nPublic Records Act (OPRA) “in favor of the public’s right of access,” N.J.S.A.\\n\\n47:1A-1, I would hold that the trial court erred in granting CPANJ’s motion to\\n\\ndismiss Count One of the ACLU’s complaint pursuant to ----\\n                                                      Rule 4:6-2(e).\\n\\n      In addition, even if the majority were correct on the ACLU’s OPRA\\n\\ncount, the records the ACLU requested from CPANJ are common-law public\\n\\ndocuments. Because no private citizens are members of CPANJ, every\\n\\ndocument recorded, generated, or produced by CPANJ is recorded, generated,\\n\\nor produced by a public official. And CPANJ itself says that it was created to\\n\\npromote “the orderly administration of criminal justice within the State and the\\n\\nfair and effective enforcement of the constitution and laws of this State” -- a\\n\\ngovernmental purpose of the highest order.\\n\\n      In any event, CPANJ conceded that it has no physical office, and it\\n\\nmaintains all documents in the county prosecutors’ offices. The county\\n\\nprosecutors’ offices are public offices under the common law. Any CPANJ\\n\\ndocuments stored at the county prosecutors’ offices are by definition common\\n\\nlaw public records. I would therefore hold that the trial court also erred in\\n\\ndismissing Count Two of the ACLU’s complaint.\\n\\n                                        2\\n       For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n      All agree that the county prosecutors themselves are “public agenc[ies]”\\n\\nsubject to OPRA.

Indeed, in many cases this\\n\\nCourt has assumed that county prosecutors and county prosecutors’ offices fall\\n\\nunder N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1’s definition of “public agency” and has simply\\n\\nconsidered whether a specific OPRA exemption nonetheless shielded the\\n\\nrecords in question from access.

CPANJ is operated entirely by\\n\\ngovernment appointees who are paid with New Jersey taxpayer funds to\\n\\nperform legal duties on behalf of the State of New Jersey while using\\n\\ngovernment resources to do so.”\\n\\n      CPANJ acknowledges this. In its responsive letter to the ACLU dated\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019, then-CPANJ President, the Sussex County Prosecutor,\\n\\nstated that CPANJ is “comprised of the 21 County Prosecutors,” and “does not\\n\\nhave a physical office, location, or even an online presence.”\\n\\n      At oral argument, counsel for CPANJ agreed that only sitting county\\n\\nprosecutors can participate in CPANJ -- once a county prosecutor has resigned\\n\\nor been removed, that individual can no longer participate. He also stated that\\n\\nbecause CPANJ has no physical office, it maintains all documents in the\\n\\ncounty prosecutors’ offices. And he conceded that CPANJ is funded only\\n\\nthrough government resources (i.e., county prosecutors’ office resources) --\\n\\nthere are no private sources of funding.\\n\\n      In their briefing and at argument, the ACLU and amici Libertarians for\\n\\nTransparent Government and the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\\n\\n(together, LFTG) likewise assert that: (1) no private citizens are members of\\n\\n                                       8\\n CPANJ; (2) CPANJ funding appears to be derived entirely from county\\n\\nprosecutors’ offices; and (3) CPANJ has no office, no email address, and no\\n\\nstaff of its own, and relies solely on government staff and government\\n\\nresources, including email addresses, funds, and computers, to complete all of\\n\\nCPANJ’s work. 2 In other words, “the overlap” between the county\\n\\nprosecutors’ offices and CPANJ “is complete,” and CPANJ is simply\\n\\n“organizational shorthand for the twenty-one county prosecutor’s offices.”\\n\\n      The majority states that CPANJ is a “private entity.” Ante at ___ (slip\\n\\nop. at 28). But based on their actions, the county prosecutors see CPANJ as\\n\\n“organizational shorthand” for themselves and their offices, not as any separate\\n\\nprivate entity.\\n\\n      The relevant statutes prove the point. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:158-1.1,\\n\\n“[a]ny person appointed to the office of county prosecutor” must “serve on a\\n\\nfull-time basis” and “shall not engage in the practice of law or other gainful\\n\\nemployment.” Similarly, assistant prosecutors may never engage in “outside\\n\\nemployment” that involves “the private practice of law or the provision of\\n\\nother legal services.” N.J.S.A. 2A:158-15.1b. Yet the county prosecutors and\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  It is appropriate to consider the assertions set forth by the ACLU and their\\namici in briefing and at oral argument because the ACLU has not yet had an\\nopportunity to amend its complaint, and leave to amend is to be freely granted.\\nSee Printing Mart, \\n116 N.J. at 746\\n.\\n                                         9\\n assistant prosecutors regularly represent CPANJ in court, demonstrating that\\n\\nthey view CPANJ as the voice of the county prosecutors speaking together, not\\n\\nas a private organization.\\n\\n         In this case, an Assistant Prosecutor from the Mercer County\\n\\nProsecutor’s Office represented CPANJ before the trial court and the Appellate\\n\\nDivision, using his county prosecutor’s office email address and resources to\\n\\ndo so.\\n\\n         In In re Request to Release Certain Pretrial Detainees, CPANJ\\n\\nparticipated before this Court as a “party in interest,” urging the Court not to\\n\\ncompel the release of pretrial detainees in response to COVID-19. See \\n245\\n\\nN.J. 218\\n (2021). CPANJ was represented by the then-President of CPANJ, the\\n\\nHudson County Prosecutor, and Assistant Prosecutors from the Morris County\\n\\nProsecutor’s Office, Warren County Prosecutor’s Office, and Somerset County\\n\\nProsecutor’s Office. Accompanying the brief was a certification from the First\\n\\nAssistant Prosecutor for the Warren County Prosecutor’s Office explaining that\\n\\nhe had been tasked by CPANJ with authoring a portion of the brief and had\\n\\nobtained data on COVID-19 from representatives of CPANJ, i.e., staff from\\n\\nother county prosecutors’ offices.\\n\\n         LFTG provided a list of 29 published decisions of this Court for which\\n\\nCPANJ participated as amicus curiae and was represented by assistant\\n\\n                                        10\\n prosecutors, dating back to 1986. And there are additional cases as well. For\\n\\nexample, in State v. Higginbotham, which is pending, CPANJ submitted an\\n\\namicus curiae brief to this Court defending the constitutionality of\\n\\namendments to the child endangerment statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4. Listed as\\n\\ncounsel for CPANJ on the brief were then-President of CPANJ, the Cape May\\n\\nCounty Prosecutor, and Assistant Prosecutors from the Mercer County\\n\\nProsecutor’s Office, Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office, Bergen County\\n\\nProsecutor’s Office, and Cape May County Prosecutor’s Office.\\n\\n      The county prosecutors thus see CPANJ as a convenient way to make\\n\\ntheir collective views known to this Court -- when they agree, rather than\\n\\nsubmit 21 amicus briefs, they submit one joint brief. In a certification in\\n\\nsupport of CPANJ’s motion to appear as amicus curiae in State v. Smart, \\n253\\n\\nN.J. 156\\n (2023), to defend the constitutionality of a particular search and\\n\\nseizure, an Acting Assistant Prosecutor from the Monmouth County\\n\\nProsecutor’s Office explained why: “CPANJ is an organization whose\\n\\nmembership is comprised of the 21 county prosecutor’s offices in New Jersey,”\\n\\nand it “serves to represent the interests of the assistant prosecutors employed\\n\\nin the diverse prosecutor’s offices around the State.”\\n\\n      All of this points to CPANJ being indivisible from the county\\n\\nprosecutors’ offices themselves.\\n\\n                                       11\\n       CPANJ conceded that the offices of the county prosecutors are public\\n\\nagencies under OPRA. If county prosecutors’ offices are public agencies\\n\\nunder OPRA, and CPANJ is the county prosecutors’ offices by another name,\\n\\nthen CPANJ should likewise be a public agency subject to OPRA’s\\n\\nrequirements. I would therefore hold that the ACLU has asserted sufficient\\n\\nfacts to at least suggest that CPANJ is mere shorthand for New Jersey’s county\\n\\nprosecutors’ offices, and meets the definition of “public agency” in N.J.S.A.\\n\\n47:1A-1.1 in the same way that they do.\\n\\n      At the very least, the ACLU should have been entitled to discovery of\\n\\ninformation uniquely in CPANJ’s possession that is relevant to whether it\\n\\nmeets the definition of public agency under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. CPANJ\\n\\npossesses the facts that establish whether it and the county prosecutors’ offices\\n\\nare actually one and the same, and yet it moved to dismiss this case without\\n\\ndisclosing that information. The Court should not countenance such an\\n\\napproach. Cf. Cardali v. Cardali, \\n255 N.J. 85\\n, 110-11 (2023) (one party cannot\\n\\nbe required to put forth information solely in the other party’s possession\\n\\nwithout first having the opportunity to obtain that information through\\n\\ndiscovery).\\n\\n      We have previously endorsed OPRA’s “underlying premise . . . that\\n\\nsociety as a whole suffers when ‘governmental bodies are permitted to operate\\n\\n                                       12\\n in secrecy.’” Fair Share, \\n207 N.J. at 502\\n (quoting Asbury Park Press, \\n374 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. at 329\\n). Public officials should not be permitted to hide behind\\n\\norganizational forms to utilize government resources to carry out government\\n\\nbusiness in secrecy. This means that county prosecutors’ offices should not be\\n\\npermitted to escape OPRA by labeling certain of their activities as occurring\\n\\non behalf of CPANJ, rather than themselves, when the ACLU alleges that there\\n\\nis no functional difference between the two.\\n\\n      I would hold the trial court erred in granting CPANJ’s motion to dismiss\\n\\nthe ACLU’s complaint pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e). In my view, the court should\\n\\nhave either granted discovery on whether CPANJ is a “public agency” under\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, or considered CPANJ’s argument that the documents in\\n\\nquestion were exempt from OPRA for various reasons. I therefore dissent\\n\\nfrom the majority’s affirmance of the dismissal of Count One of the ACLU’s\\n\\ncomplaint at this stage.\\n\\n                                      II.\\n\\n      Even if the majority were correct that the ACLU did not allege sufficient\\n\\nfacts that CPANJ meets the definition of “public agency” in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-\\n\\n1.1 to survive a motion to dismiss, I would nonetheless hold that the ACLU\\n\\nsufficiently alleged that the records it requested from CPANJ are common-law\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      13\\n public records. I therefore separately dissent from the majority’s affirmance of\\n\\nthe dismissal of Count Two of the ACLU’s complaint.\\n\\n      As the majority correctly explains, “OPRA does not limit the right of\\n\\naccess to government records under the common law.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at\\n\\n25) (quoting Rivera, 250 N.J. at 143). The majority also acknowledges that\\n\\n“[t]he definition of a public record under the common law is broader than\\n\\nunder OPRA.” Rivera, 250 N.J. at 143.\\n\\n      A common law public record “is one that is made by a public official in\\n\\nthe exercise of [the official’s] public function, either because the record was\\n\\nrequired or directed by law to be made or kept, or because it was filed in a\\n\\npublic office.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 27) (emphasis added) (quoting Keddie\\n\\nv. Rutgers, \\n148 N.J. 36\\n, 49 (1997)). The majority concludes that the requested\\n\\ndocuments are not common law public records because “[t]he ACLU identifies\\n\\nno statute, regulation, or other mandate requiring CPANJ to create or maintain\\n\\nthe documents in dispute,” and because “[t]he ACLU does not allege that\\n\\nCPANJ maintains public documents in a public office.” Ante at ___ (slip op.\\n\\nat 28). The first is not required; the second is incorrect.\\n\\n      As an initial matter, “written memorials made by public officers in the\\n\\nexercise of public functions are common-law public records” “even if they are\\n\\nnot” “required by law to be made, maintained or kept on file.” Loigman v.\\n\\n                                        14\\n Kimmelman, \\n102 N.J. 98\\n, 102 (1986) (citations and internal quotation marks\\n\\nomitted); Shuttleworth v. City of Camden, \\n258 N.J. Super. 573\\n, 582-83 (App.\\n\\nDiv. 1992) (quoting N.J.S.A. 47:1A-2). Common law public records thus\\n\\n“include almost every document recorded, generated, or produced by public\\n\\nofficials.” Shuttleworth, \\n258 N.J. Super. at 582\\n (emphasis added).\\n\\n      The documents the ACLU requested were written by public officers\\n\\nexercising public functions.\\n\\n      As earlier noted, CPANJ concedes that it consists of only the 21 sitting\\n\\ncounty prosecutors. It concedes that it has no private citizens as members, and\\n\\nno paid staff. Therefore, every document recorded, generated, or produced by\\n\\nCPANJ must be recorded, generated, or produced by a public official; there is\\n\\nsimply no one other than public officials that can perform CPANJ work.\\n\\n      CPANJ disputes that the county prosecutors and their staff are exercising\\n\\nany governmental function when acting on behalf of CPANJ. At oral\\n\\nargument, counsel for CPANJ suggested that a county prosecutor’s\\n\\nparticipation in CPANJ is similar to that prosecutor serving on their town’s\\n\\n“little league board.” That is false. One must go no further than CPANJ’s own\\n\\nwords, and the statutes enacted by the Legislature, to see why.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       15\\n       First, in its tax returns, CPANJ does not describe itself as a volunteer\\n\\norganization with social, professional, or athletic aims. It describes itself as an\\n\\norganization created to\\n\\n            maintain close cooperation between the Attorney\\n            General of the State of New Jersey, the Division of\\n            Criminal Justice of the State of New Jersey and the\\n            twenty-one (21) county prosecutors of the State of New\\n            Jersey relative to . . . developing educational programs\\n            so as to promote the orderly administration of criminal\\n            justice within the State of New Jersey, consistent with\\n            the Constitution and the laws of the State of New\\n            Jersey.\\n\\nSimilarly, in its September 18, 2019 response to the ACLU, CPANJ stated that\\n\\nits goal is “the promotion of the orderly administration of criminal justice\\n\\nwithin the State and the fair and effective enforcement of the constitution and\\n\\nlaws of this State through the cooperation of all law enforcement agencies.”\\n\\n      The promotion of the orderly administration of criminal justice within\\n\\nthe State, and the fair and effective enforcement of our criminal laws and our\\n\\nconstitution, is a governmental function of the highest order. How do we\\n\\nknow? Because the Legislature has declared it to be.\\n\\n      In 1970, the Legislature declared it\\n\\n            the public policy of this State to encourage cooperation\\n            among law enforcement officers and to provide for the\\n            general supervision of criminal justice by the Attorney\\n            General as chief law enforcement officer of the State,\\n            in order to secure the benefits of a uniform and efficient\\n\\n                                        16\\n              enforcement of the criminal law and the administration\\n             of criminal justice throughout the State.\\n\\n             [N.J.S.A. 52:17B-98.]\\n\\nBut the Legislature did not simply leave the “administration of criminal justice\\n\\nthroughout the State” to the Attorney General. Instead, it statutorily mandated\\n\\nthat the county prosecutors “cooperate with and aid the Attorney General” in\\n\\nthis vital work. N.J.S.A. 52:17B-112(a). In order to facilitate that aid and\\n\\ncooperation, it also provided that “[t]he Attorney General may, from time to\\n\\ntime, and as often as may be required, call into conference the county\\n\\nprosecutors, . . . for the purpose of discussing the duties of their respective\\n\\noffices with a view to the adequate and uniform enforcement of the criminal\\n\\nlaws of this State.” \\nId.\\n at (c).\\n\\n      According to the ACLU, that is exactly what CPANJ does: provides a\\n\\nconvenient way for all 21 county prosecutors to cooperate with and aid the\\n\\nAttorney General in the performance of his official duties regarding the fair\\n\\nand effective enforcement of the criminal law of this State. That is true when\\n\\nCPANJ submits amicus briefs to this court defending the constitutionality of a\\n\\ncriminal statute, see State v. Higginbotham, or a particular search and seizure,\\n\\nsee State v. Smart. It is true when CPANJ weighs in on the possible release of\\n\\npretrial detainees in response to COVID-19. See In re Request to Release\\n\\nCertain Pretrial Detainees.\\n                                        17\\n       And, the ACLU alleges, it is true when CPANJ meets with the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral to discuss the uniform and effective enforcement of this State’s\\n\\ncriminal laws. In its complaint, the ACLU alleges that CPANJ “regularly\\n\\nmeets with representatives of the Attorney General of New Jersey at the\\n\\nHughes Justice Complex in Trenton, New Jersey and is treated by the Office of\\n\\nthe Attorney General . . . as a partner in implementing statewide criminal\\n\\njustice policy.” The Appellate Division similarly stated that “CPANJ’s\\n\\nmonthly meetings are a convenient forum for the Attorney General to meet\\n\\nwith the county prosecutors. Such meetings could be convened, of course,\\n\\nwithout the existence of CPANJ.” ACLU of N.J. v. Cnty. Prosecutors Ass’n of\\n\\nN.J., \\n474 N.J. Super. 243\\n, 267 (App. Div. 2022).\\n\\n      Therefore, CPANJ’s documents are written by public officers exercising\\n\\npublic functions.\\n\\n      However, even if county prosecutors and their staff were somehow not\\n\\nexercising public functions when acting on behalf of CPANJ, CPANJ records\\n\\nwould still meet the definition of common law public records. This is so\\n\\nbecause any document “filed in a public office” is a common law public\\n\\nrecord. Keddie, \\n148 N.J. at 49\\n.\\n\\n      In Keddie, a Rutgers professor sought information from Rutgers about\\n\\nwork that private attorneys performed on civil rights claims and other matters.\\n\\n                                      18\\n Id. at 41\\n. The professor specifically requested bills that the private attorneys\\n\\nsubmitted to Rutgers for payment. \\nIbid.\\n This Court held that the private\\n\\nattorneys’ bills were common law public records because they were “writings\\n\\nfiled in a public office,” i.e., writings filed at Rutgers. \\nId. at 50\\n.\\n\\n      Here, again, CPANJ has conceded that it has no physical office, and it\\n\\nmaintains any and all documents that it has in the county prosecutors’ offices.\\n\\nThe county prosecutors’ offices are, without question, public offices under the\\n\\ncommon law. Therefore, any CPANJ documents stored at the county\\n\\nprosecutors’ offices are common law public records.\\n\\n      Because CPANJ documents are common law public records, the trial\\n\\ncourt should have assessed whether the ACLU “establish[ed] an interest in the\\n\\nsubject matter of the material” and then should have balanced the ACLU’s\\n\\n“right to access” the materials against CPANJ’s “interest in preventing\\n\\ndisclosure.” Mason v. City of Hoboken, \\n196 N.J. 51\\n, 67-68 (2008). It did not.\\n\\nFor this independent reason, I dissent from the majority’s affirmance of the\\n\\ndismissal of Count Two of the ACLU’s complaint.\\n\\n                                         III.\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         19\\n '),\n",

(A-48/49-22) (087975)\\n\\nArgued November 8, 2023 -- Decided May 13, 2024\\n\\nPATTERSON, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       The Court considers whether an agreement between a real estate broker and a\\nreal estate salesperson identifying the salesperson as an independent contractor\\nexcludes the salesperson from the Wage Payment Law (WPL), a statute that governs\\ncompensation paid to employees but does not apply to independent contractors.\\n\\n      Plaintiff James Kennedy, II, a real estate salesperson, entered into two written\\nagreements to affiliate as an independent contractor with defendant Weichert Co.\\n(Weichert), a real estate broker. After working as a Weichert salesperson from 2012\\nto 2018, Kennedy filed this putative class action, alleging that Weichert violated the\\nWPL by misclassifying him and other real estate salespersons as independent\\ncontractors and unlawfully deducting fees and expenses from their commissions.\\n\\n       The trial court denied Weichert’s motion to dismiss Kennedy’s complaint for\\nfailure to state a claim, ruling that the question of Kennedy’s status was not\\ndetermined by the parties’ agreement, but by the legal standard that generally\\ngoverns employee classification issues under the WPL, known as the “ABC” test.\\nThe Appellate Division affirmed as modified, concluding that the 2018 amendments\\nto the New Jersey Real Estate License Act, commonly known as the Brokers Act,\\nauthorized real estate brokers and salespersons to enter into independent contractor\\nrelationships, but that those amendments applied prospectively and thus governed\\nonly a brief portion of Kennedy’s claim.\\n\\n       The Court granted leave to appeal but then remanded to the Appellate\\nDivision when, in 2022, the Legislature further amended the Brokers Act, providing\\nin part that the 2018 amendments apply retroactively. On remand, the Appellate\\nDivision again affirmed, holding that the ABC test does not apply to real estate\\nbroker-salespersons or salespersons but that the parties’ contractual election of a\\nbusiness affiliation was a relevant but not dispositive factor in an employment status\\ndetermination. \\n474 N.J. Super. 541\\n, 551-59 (App. Div. 2023). The Court granted\\nWeichert’s motion for leave to appeal, \\n254 N.J. 173\\n (2023), and Kennedy’s cross-\\nmotion for leave to appeal, \\n254 N.J. 178\\n (2023).\\n                                          1\\n HELD: The parties’ agreement to enter into an independent contractor business\\naffiliation is enforceable under N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2, and Kennedy, as an independent\\ncontractor, was not subject to the WPL pursuant to N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1(b). The trial\\ncourt therefore erred when it denied Weichert’s motion to dismiss the complaint.\\n\\n1. The Legislature enacted the Brokers Act in 1921 in part to define, regulate, and\\nlicense real estate brokers and salesmen. The Brokers Act has since been amended\\nand has been the subject of regulations promulgated by the Real Estate Commission.\\nFrom 1993 until the 2018 amendments to the Brokers Act, the statute defined a “real\\nestate salesperson” as a “person who . . . is employed by and operates under the\\nsupervision of a licensed real estate broker” to conduct real estate activities\\nenumerated in the statute. N.J.S.A. 45:15-3 (2017). (pp. 14-16)\\n\\n2. The WPL prohibits employers from withholding or diverting any portion of an\\nemployee’s wages unless the employer is required or empowered to do so by law or\\nfor purposes enumerated in the statute. The WPL provides that “independent\\ncontractors and subcontractors shall not be considered employees,” but it prescribes\\nno statutory standard for a court to determine whether a person is an employee or an\\nindependent contractor. N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1(b). In Hargrove v. Sleepy’s, LLC, the\\nCourt adopted the ABC test for determining whether a person is an employee or an\\nindependent contractor under the WPL. \\n220 N.J. 289\\n, 312-16 (2015). (pp. 16-18)\\n\\n3. In the wake of Hargrove, the Real Estate Commission adopted regulations,\\neffective in July 2017, to make clear that a real estate broker and a real estate\\nsalesperson may elect a business affiliation in which the salesperson is an\\nindependent contractor, not an employee. In August 2018, the Legislature amended\\nthe Brokers Act accordingly. Most significantly, the Legislature added a new\\nsection, N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2, providing that “[n]otwithstanding any provision of [the\\nBroker’s Act] or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a business\\naffiliation between a broker and a broker-salesperson or salesperson may be that of\\nan employment relationship or . . . an independent contractor” and that “[t]he nature\\nof the business affiliation shall be defined in [a] written agreement.” (pp. 18-21)\\n\\n4. After the Appellate Division’s first decision in this matter, the Legislature passed\\na bill to further amend the Brokers Act. The Court reviews the legislative history of\\nthe bill, including the deletion of language about which Governor Philip D. Murphy\\nexpressed concern that it could be invoked by employers in other industries in an\\nattempt to misclassify employees. With regard to the real estate industry, the 2022\\namendments, as enacted, provided that N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2 “shall apply retroactively\\nto enforce but not change any written agreement between a broker-salesperson or\\nsalesperson and a broker” under which “the broker-salesperson or salesperson is or\\nwas [identified as] an independent contractor.” (pp. 21-24)\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n 5. The plain language of the Brokers Act addresses whether Kennedy may assert a\\nclaim under the WPL. The Legislature’s use of the word “notwithstanding” in\\nN.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2 is significant: the Legislature clearly intended that -- in the real\\nestate setting in which the Brokers Act applies -- the parties’ business affiliation\\nagreement will prevail, even if it conflicts with a law, rule, or regulation. That\\nlegislative intent is underscored by the 2022 amendments and their history. Under\\nthe Brokers Act, the parties’ agreement to an independent contractor affiliation\\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2 is not merely one of several factors in the analysis;\\nrather, that agreement is dispositive and a court must enforce its terms. (pp. 24-27)\\n\\n6. Kennedy, who agreed in writing to affiliate with Weichert as an independent\\ncontractor, must accordingly be treated as an independent contractor\\n“notwithstanding . . . any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary,” including\\nthe WPL. The written agreement is dispositive, and Kennedy was not subject to the\\nABC test or to any other classification standard. Because he was an independent\\ncontractor when he was affiliated with Weichert, Kennedy was not covered by the\\nWPL and therefore cannot assert the claim set forth in his complaint, a\\nmisclassification claim premised on the WPL.

(Weichert) in which he\\n\\nagreed to affiliate with Weichert as an independent contractor. After working\\n\\nfor six years as a Weichert salesperson, Kennedy filed this putative class\\n\\naction, alleging that Weichert violated the WPL by misclassifying him and\\n\\nother real estate salespersons as independent contractors and unlawfully\\n\\ndeducting marketing fees and other expenses from their commissions.\\n\\n      Weichert moved to dismiss Kennedy’s complaint for failure to state a\\n\\nclaim pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e). It argued that its agreement with Kennedy,\\n\\nwhich provided that Kennedy would work as an independent contractor, was\\n\\nenforceable under the Brokers Act as amended in 2018. The trial court denied\\n\\nWeichert’s motion, ruling that the question of Kennedy’s status was not\\n\\ndetermined by the parties’ agreement, but by the legal standard that generally\\n\\ngoverns employee classification issues under the WPL.\\n\\n      Weichert appealed, and the Appellate Division affirmed as modified the\\n\\ntrial court’s decision. The appellate court agreed with Weichert that the 2018\\n\\namendments to the Brokers Act authorized real estate brokers and real estate\\n\\nsalespersons to enter into independent contractor relationships. It ruled,\\n\\n                                        3\\n however, that the 2018 amendments applied only prospectively to contracts\\n\\nexecuted after the amendments’ effective date and that those amendments\\n\\ngoverned only a brief portion of the time period relevant to Kennedy’s claim.\\n\\n      After we granted the parties’ cross-motions for leave to appeal, the\\n\\nSenate and General Assembly passed a bill further amending the Brokers Act.\\n\\nA. 6206. The bill provided in part that the 2018 amendments would apply\\n\\nretroactively to contracts between real estate brokers and real estate\\n\\nsalespersons that were executed prior to the bill’s effective date. \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      Governor Philip D. Murphy conditionally vetoed the bill approved by\\n\\nthe Senate and General Assembly. Governor’s Veto Statement to A. 6206\\n\\n(Jan. 10, 2022). The Governor concurred with the Legislature’s retroactive\\n\\napplication of the 2018 amendments enforcing agreements to independent\\n\\ncontractor business affiliations in the real estate field, but he recommended\\n\\ndeleting the language that the Legislature proposed because of concerns that\\n\\nemployers in other industries might invoke that language in an attempt to\\n\\nmisclassify employees. \\nIbid.\\n The Governor instead recommended new\\n\\nlanguage confirming that the provision addressing business affiliations added\\n\\nto the Brokers Act in the 2018 amendments would “apply retroactively to\\n\\nenforce but not change” any written agreement between a broker-salesperson\\n\\nor salesperson and a broker providing that the broker-salesperson or\\n\\n                                        4\\n salesperson was an independent contractor. \\nIbid.\\n The Legislature accepted the\\n\\nGovernor’s changes to the bill, and the 2022 amendments were enacted. See\\n\\nL. 2021, c. 486.\\n\\n      We remanded the matter to the Appellate Division to consider the impact\\n\\nof the 2022 amendments to the Brokers Act on this appeal. The Appellate\\n\\nDivision again affirmed the trial court’s denial of Weichert’s motion to\\n\\ndismiss. Kennedy v. Weichert Co., \\n474 N.J. Super. 541\\n, 551-57 (App. Div.\\n\\n2023). The appellate court held that the test that generally governs\\n\\nclassification disputes under the WPL does not apply to real estate broker-\\n\\nsalespersons or salespersons. \\nIbid.\\n It viewed the parties’ contractual election\\n\\nof a business affiliation to be a relevant but not dispositive factor in an\\n\\nemployment status determination under the WPL. \\nId. at 559\\n.\\n\\n      We granted the parties’ cross-motions for leave to appeal, and now\\n\\nreverse. We hold that the parties’ agreement to enter into an independent\\n\\ncontractor business affiliation is enforceable under N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2 and that\\n\\nKennedy, as an independent contractor, was not subject to the WPL pursuant\\n\\nto N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1(b). We remand this matter for the dismissal of\\n\\nKennedy’s complaint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         5\\n                                          I.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Weichert is a real estate broker operating offices throughout New Jersey.\\n\\nKennedy, a licensed real estate salesperson, worked for Weichert from 2012 to\\n\\n2018, based at its Howell real estate office. It is undisputed that the parties\\n\\nagreed in writing that Kennedy would work as a Weichert salesperson in the\\n\\ncapacity of an independent contractor, not as an employee. 1\\n\\n      On November 6, 2018, the contract between Kennedy and Weichert was\\n\\nterminated. The record does not indicate which party terminated the contract\\n\\nor the reason for the termination.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n                                        1.\\n\\n      On March 25, 2019, Kennedy filed this action on his own behalf and on\\n\\nbehalf of a putative class defined as “[a]ll individuals that contracted as a ‘real\\n\\nestate salesperson’ with Defendant Weichert Co. within the State of New\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Neither Kennedy nor Weichert submitted their written agreements to the trial\\ncourt. At the Appellate Division’s request, counsel for Weichert submitted to\\nthe court two agreements executed by Kennedy and Weichert: an agreement\\nentitled “Independent Contractor Agreement Between Broker and Salesperson”\\ndated August 8, 2012, and an agreement entitled “Addendum to Independent\\nContractor Agreement between Broker and Salesperson” dated June 8, 2017.\\nBoth agreements provide, among other terms, that Kennedy would act as an\\nindependent contractor, and that he would be compensated by commission.\\n                                      6\\n Jersey from March 25, 2013 through to the present.” He alleged that\\n\\nnotwithstanding the Weichert salespersons’ agreement to work as independent\\n\\ncontractors, salespersons should be deemed “employees” pursuant to the\\n\\n“ABC” test that we adopted as the governing standard for WPL classification\\n\\ndisputes in Hargrove v. Sleepy’s, LLC, \\n220 N.J. 289\\n, 312-16 (2015). Kennedy\\n\\nasserted that Weichert misclassified the real estate salespersons as independent\\n\\ncontractors in order to circumvent the WPL’s requirements. He alleged that\\n\\nWeichert violated the WPL by deducting money from the salespersons’\\n\\ncommissions and requiring that salespersons pay certain expenses. Kennedy\\n\\nsought compensatory damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, and other\\n\\nremedies.\\n\\n      Weichert filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a\\n\\nclaim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 4:6-2(e). 2 Weichert sought\\n\\na declaration that the parties’ agreement presumptively defines their business\\n\\naffiliation. Asserting that the ABC test is incompatible with the requirements\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n    In support of its motion to dismiss, Weichert argued before the trial court\\nand the Appellate Division that because this Court in Hargrove imported the\\nABC test from a provision of the Unemployment Compensation Law, see\\nN.J.S.A. 43:21-19(i)(6)(A) to (C), real estate salespersons should be exempt\\nfrom the WPL in light of the UCL’s exemption for real estate salespersons\\ncompensated entirely by commission, see N.J.S.A. 43:21-19(i)(7)(K).\\nWeichert did not raise that argument before this Court, and we do not consider\\nit.\\n                                          7\\n imposed by the Brokers Act on real estate brokers, broker-salespersons, and\\n\\nsalespersons, Weichert contended that if the court did not find that the parties’\\n\\nagreement defined their affiliation, it should apply a test other than the ABC\\n\\ntest to real estate salespersons.\\n\\n      The trial court found that under Hargrove, \\n220 N.J. at 312-16\\n, the ABC\\n\\ntest governs the WPL claim asserted by Kennedy and the putative class. The\\n\\ncourt therefore denied Weichert’s motion to dismiss.\\n\\n                                        2.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division granted Weichert’s motion for leave to appeal.\\n\\nThe appellate court acknowledged that on August 10, 2018, the Legislature\\n\\nhad amended the Brokers Act to adopt N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2, a provision that\\n\\nauthorizes real estate brokers and real estate salespersons to enter into\\n\\nindependent contractor business affiliations. The Appellate Division declined,\\n\\nhowever, to retroactively apply the Act as amended to Kennedy’s claim based\\n\\non alleged WPL violations prior to the amendments. It found that for all but\\n\\nthe last three months of the time period relevant to Kennedy’s claim, the 2018\\n\\namendments did not apply, and that the question of Kennedy’s classification\\n\\nfor that period should therefore be determined under the ABC test.\\n\\n      With respect to the three-month period to which the 2018 amendments to\\n\\nthe Brokers Act applied, the Appellate Division declined to assess the impact\\n\\n                                        8\\n of those amendments on the claim. It instead affirmed the trial court’s denial\\n\\nof Weichert’s motion to dismiss and remanded the matter to the trial court to\\n\\ndetermine, based on a full factual record, the test that should apply to\\n\\nKennedy’s claims for the time period following the 2018 amendments to the\\n\\nBrokers Act.\\n\\n                                        3.\\n\\n      We granted Weichert’s motion for leave to appeal. \\n249 N.J. 66\\n (2021).\\n\\nShortly after we granted leave to appeal, the Legislature enacted the 2022\\n\\nAmendments to the Brokers Act. L. 2021, c. 486.\\n\\n      We then vacated our grant of leave to appeal and summarily remanded\\n\\nthe matter to the Appellate Division so that it could consider, in the first\\n\\ninstance, the impact of the 2022 amendments to the Brokers Act on this appeal.\\n\\n251 N.J. 22\\n (2022).\\n\\n                                        4.\\n\\n      On remand, the Appellate Division granted amicus curiae status to the\\n\\nNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development and New Jersey\\n\\nRealtors.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division concluded that by virtue of the requirements\\n\\nimposed on real estate brokers and salespersons by the Brokers Act, the ABC\\n\\ntest imposed by Hargrove is “a standard virtually unattainable for real estate\\n\\n                                         9\\n salespersons.” Kennedy, 474 N.J. Super. at 553-54. The appellate court held\\n\\nthat “Hargrove does not apply to WPL claims asserted by fully commissioned\\n\\nreal estate salespersons because the Brokers Act forecloses application of the\\n\\nABC test.” Id. at 551.\\n\\n      Nonetheless, the Appellate Division declined to find that the written\\n\\nagreement between a real estate broker and a real estate salesperson is, in and\\n\\nof itself, dispositive with respect to the parties’ business affiliation. Id. at 552-\\n\\n58. The Appellate Division cited MacDougall v. Weichert, \\n144 N.J. 380\\n, 388\\n\\n(1996), in which we stated that “an individual “may be an employee ‘for some\\n\\npurposes but an independent contractor for others.’” Kennedy, 474 N.J. Super.\\n\\nat 557-59 (quoting MacDougall, \\n144 N.J. at 388\\n). The appellate court\\n\\nconcluded that “the written agreement required by [N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2(a)] is a\\n\\nfactor, but not the sole factor, in determining the employment status of a fully\\n\\ncommissioned real estate salesperson.” Id. at 551. It reasoned that holding\\n\\nthat the parties’ written contract defines the business relationship would\\n\\ndeviate from “decades of precedent that requires us to look beyond the words\\n\\nused in this agreement,” a determination it viewed to be “more appropriately\\n\\nthe province of our Supreme Court.” Id. at 559.\\n\\n      Accordingly, the Appellate Division affirmed as modified the trial\\n\\ncourt’s denial of Weichert’s motion to dismiss and remanded the matter to the\\n\\n                                         10\\n trial court for a determination of the appropriate test to define the relationship\\n\\nbetween a real estate broker and a real estate salesperson. Id. at 561.\\n\\n                                        5.\\n\\n      We granted Weichert’s motion for leave to appeal, \\n254 N.J. 173\\n (2023),\\n\\nand Kennedy’s cross-motion for leave to appeal, \\n254 N.J. 178\\n (2023). The\\n\\nNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development and New Jersey\\n\\nRealtors retained their amicus curiae status.\\n\\n                                        II.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Kennedy argues that we should reverse the Appellate Division’s\\n\\ndetermination that the ABC test adopted in Hargrove does not govern the\\n\\nquestion of his employment status for purposes of his WPL claim. He asserts\\n\\nthat absent express language in the Brokers Act prescribing an exception to\\n\\nHargrove for real estate salespersons, the Appellate Division should have held\\n\\nthat the ABC test governs misclassification disputes under the WPL that\\n\\ninvolve real estate salespersons, just as it governs such disputes involving\\n\\nworkers in other industries.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      Weichert agrees with the Appellate Division’s holding that Hargrove\\n\\ndoes not apply to WPL disputes involving real estate salespersons, given the\\n\\n                                        11\\n plain terms of the Brokers Act as amended in 2018 and 2022. It contends,\\n\\nhowever, that the appellate court deviated from the Legislature’s mandate\\n\\nwhen it declined to enforce the parties’ agreement that Kennedy was an\\n\\nindependent contractor and instead held that the agreement is only one factor\\n\\nin the misclassification analysis.\\n\\n                                         C.\\n\\n      Amicus curiae the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce\\n\\nDevelopment argues that the Brokers Act recognizes the business affiliation\\n\\nset forth in the parties’ contract to be a relevant but not dispositive factor in\\n\\ndetermining whether a real estate salesperson is an independent contractor or\\n\\nan employee for purposes of the WPL.\\n\\n                                         D.\\n\\n      Amicus curiae New Jersey Realtors argues that the Legislature expressly\\n\\nexempted real estate salespersons from WPL mandates that are incompatible\\n\\nwith the Brokers Act and longstanding practice, and that a decision declaring\\n\\nall real estate salespersons to be employees under the WPL would imperil the\\n\\ncareers of part-time or less productive salespersons and disrupt the real estate\\n\\nindustry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         12\\n                                        III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      We review de novo a court’s determination of a motion to dismiss for\\n\\nfailure to state a claim under Rule 4:6-2(e). W.S. v. Hildreth, \\n252 N.J. 506\\n,\\n\\n518 (2023). In that inquiry, we owe no deference to the trial court’s legal\\n\\nconclusions. Dimitrakopoulos v. Borrus, Goldin, Foley, Vignuolo, Hyman &\\n\\nStahl, P.C., \\n237 N.J. 91\\n, 108 (2019). When an appeal involves the\\n\\ninterpretation of a statute, we review de novo the court’s statutory\\n\\nconstruction. Hildreth, 252 N.J. at 518-19.\\n\\n      “When courts interpret the meaning of a statute, the paramount goal is\\n\\n‘to determine and give effect to the Legislature’s intent.’” Malanga v.\\n\\nTownship of West Orange, \\n253 N.J. 291\\n, 310 (2023) (quoting State v.

It requires, for example,\\n\\nthat a real estate salesperson conduct real estate operations enumerated in the\\n\\nstatute “under the supervision of a licensed real estate broker.” N.J.S.A.\\n\\n45:15-3. The salesperson’s license “shall be kept by the broker,” and must be\\n\\n“prominently displayed” at the broker’s main office. N.J.S.A. 45:15-12, -14.\\n\\nA salesperson or broker-salesperson “shall be licensed under a broker” and\\n\\n“cannot be licensed with more than one broker at the same time.” N.J.S.A.\\n\\n45:15-14. In short, the Brokers Act requires that a real estate salesperson\\n\\naffiliate with a broker in order to conduct real estate activities and imposes on\\n\\nthat broker significant responsibilities with respect to the salesperson’s\\n\\noperations. N.J.S.A. 45:15-3, -12, -14.\\n\\n      The core issue in this appeal -- the business affiliation between a real\\n\\nestate broker and a real estate broker-salesperson or salesperson -- has been\\n\\naddressed by the Legislature in successive amendments to the Brokers Act. It\\n\\nhas also been the subject of regulations promulgated by the Real Estate\\n\\nCommission, an entity created to regulate the real estate industry that is now a\\n\\nDivision of the Department of Banking and Insurance. See N.J.S.A. 45:15-5.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        15\\n       From 1993 until the 2018 amendments to the Brokers Act, the statute\\n\\ndefined a “real estate salesperson” as a “person who, for compensation,\\n\\nvaluable consideration or commission, or other thing of value, or by reason of\\n\\na promise or reasonable expectation thereof, is employed by and operates\\n\\nunder the supervision of a licensed real estate broker” to conduct real estate\\n\\ntransactions and other activities enumerated in the statute. See N.J.S.A. 45:15-\\n\\n3 (2017). Viewing real estate salespersons to be “an integral, but not an\\n\\nindependent, part of [real estate brokers’] business activity,” we invoked that\\n\\nstatutory language, as well as the supervisory requirements imposed on\\n\\nbrokers, to find that real estate salespersons constituted employees for\\n\\npurposes of the Workers Compensation Act, N.J.S.A. 34:15-1 to -147.\\n\\nRe/Max, \\n162 N.J. at 286-88\\n.\\n\\n      In 2015, we decided Hargrove, addressing the standard governing\\n\\nemployment misclassification disputes under the WPL. \\n220 N.J. at 312-16\\n.\\n\\nAmong other provisions, the WPL prohibits employers from withholding or\\n\\ndiverting “any portion of an employee’s wages unless . . . [t]he employer is\\n\\nrequired or empowered to do so by New Jersey or United States law; or . . .\\n\\n[t]he amounts withheld or diverted are for” purposes enumerated in the statute.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 34:11-4.4. The WPL defines an “employee” as “any person suffered\\n\\nor permitted to work by an employer, except that independent contractors and\\n\\n                                       16\\n subcontractors shall not be considered employees,” but it prescribes no\\n\\nstatutory standard for a court to determine whether a person is an employee or\\n\\nan independent contractor. N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1(b).\\n\\n      Hargrove was an action brought in federal court by truckers hired to\\n\\ndeliver the defendant’s products to its customers. \\n220 N.J. at 295-96\\n. The\\n\\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit submitted to this Court a\\n\\ncertified question, asking that we identify the test to determine an employee’s\\n\\nstatus under the WPL and the Wage and Hour Law (WHL), N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1\\n\\nto -68. \\nId. at 295\\n. We considered, among other tests, the ABC test set forth in\\n\\nthe Unemployment Compensation Law (UCL), N.J.S.A. 43:21-19(i)(6)(A) to -\\n\\n(C), and adopted by regulation for WHL classification disputes. \\nId. at 301\\n.\\n\\n      “The ‘ABC’ test presumes an individual is an employee unless the\\n\\nemployer can make certain showings regarding the individual employed.” \\nId.\\n\\nat 305\\n. Those showings include:\\n\\n            A. Such individual has been and will continue to be\\n            free from control or direction over the performance of\\n            such service, both under contract of service and in fact;\\n            and\\n            B. Such service is either outside the usual course of the\\n            business for which such service is performed, or that\\n            such service is performed outside of all the places of\\n            business of the enterprise for which such service is\\n            performed; and\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       17\\n             C. Such individual is customarily engaged in an\\n            independently established trade, occupation, profession\\n            or business.\\n\\n            [Id. at 305 (citing N.J.S.A. 43:21-19(i)(6))].\\n\\n      We noted in Hargrove that “[t]he [Department of Labor and Workforce\\n\\nDevelopment], the agency charged with implementation and enforcement of\\n\\nthe WHL and WPL,” had declared -- “without challenge since 1995” -- that the\\n\\nABC test should govern employment status disputes under the WHL and had\\n\\n“applied the same test to employment-status issues under the WPL because of\\n\\nits similar purpose of furthering income security.” \\nId. at 316\\n. Accordingly,\\n\\nwe held that “employment-status issues raised under the WPL or WHL -- i.e.,\\n\\nwhether a person retained to provide services to an employer is an employee or\\n\\nindependent contractor -- are governed by the ‘ABC’ test.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                        2.\\n\\n      In the wake of our decision in Hargrove, the Real Estate Commission\\n\\nadopted regulations to make clear that a real estate broker and a real estate\\n\\nsalesperson may elect a business affiliation in which the salesperson is an\\n\\nindependent contractor, not an employee. The Commission observed that, in\\n\\naccordance with “[h]istorical practice as well as current practice,” real estate\\n\\n“licensees determine the nature of their business relationship.” 48 N.J.R.\\n\\n1900(a) (Sept. 19, 2016). The Commission proposed an amendment to\\n\\n                                        18\\n N.J.A.C. 11:5-4.1’s title, replacing the term “[e]mployment agreements” with\\n\\n“[l]icensee business relationship agreements,” and an amendment to N.J.A.C.\\n\\n11:5-4.1(a) requiring a broker and a salesperson or referral agent to “enter into\\n\\n. . . a written agreement that contains the terms of their business relationship”\\n\\nbefore the salesperson or referral agent conducts real estate brokerage activity.\\n\\nIbid. The Commission also proposed a new subsection, N.J.A.C. 11:5-4.1(j),\\n\\nstating that it “interprets ‘employment agreement,’ ‘employ,’ and ‘employing\\n\\nbroker’ in [the Brokers Act] and this section to permit an employment\\n\\nrelationship or an independent contractor relationship between a broker and a\\n\\nbroker-salesperson, salesperson, or referral agent.” Ibid.\\n\\n      The Commission explained that “[t]he proposed amendments will have a\\n\\npositive effect on licensees by conforming the rules to reflect the historical and\\n\\ncurrent practice that licensees are free to agree to the type of business\\n\\nrelationship that is appropriate for them.” Ibid.\\n\\n      After a period of public comment, in which all commenters supported\\n\\nthe regulations, the Commission adopted the regulations effective on July 3,\\n\\n2017. 49 N.J.R. 1910(a).\\n\\n      The Legislature addressed the question of real estate business affiliations\\n\\nthe following year. L. 2018, c. 71. On August 10, 2018, it added new\\n\\nlanguage to the Brokers Act’s definitions of the terms “real estate broker-\\n\\n                                        19\\n salesperson” and “real estate salesperson,” defining both categories to include\\n\\nindividuals “contracted” by a licensed real estate broker as well as those\\n\\n“employed” by a broker. Id. § 2. In several provisions of the Brokers Act in\\n\\nwhich a salesperson or broker-salesperson had previously been defined as\\n\\n“employed” by a broker or as a broker’s “employee,” the Legislature added the\\n\\nterms “contracted,” “contracting,” “contractor,” or “contracting broker.” See\\n\\nid. §§ 4(b), 10, 11, 12, 17, 22.\\n\\n      Most significantly, the Legislature added to the Brokers Act a new\\n\\nsection, N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2, providing that\\n\\n             a. No broker-salesperson or salesperson shall\\n             commence business activity for a broker and no broker\\n             shall authorize a broker-salesperson or salesperson to\\n             act on the broker’s behalf until a written agreement, as\\n             provided in this subsection, has been signed by the\\n             broker and broker-salesperson or salesperson. Prior to\\n             an individual’s commencement of business activity as\\n             a broker-salesperson or salesperson under the authority\\n             of a broker, the broker and broker-salesperson or\\n             salesperson shall both sign a written agreement which\\n             recites the terms under which the services of the broker-\\n             salesperson or salesperson have been retained by the\\n             broker.\\n             b. Notwithstanding any provision of [N.J.S.A.] 45:15-\\n             1 et seq. or any other law, rule, or regulation to the\\n             contrary, a business affiliation between a broker and a\\n             broker-salesperson or salesperson may be that of an\\n             employment relationship or the provision of services by\\n             an independent contractor. The nature of the business\\n             affiliation shall be defined in the written agreement\\n             required pursuant to subsection a. of this section.\\n\\n                                        20\\n             [L. 2018, c. 71, § 3 (codified at N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2).]\\n\\n      The Legislature provided that this new section “shall take effect\\n\\nimmediately” and that the remainder of the amendments would take effect on\\n\\nJanuary 1, 2018, “except the New Jersey Real Estate Commission may take\\n\\nany anticipatory administrative action as shall be necessary for the\\n\\nimplementation of this act.” Id. § 29.\\n\\n                                         3.\\n\\n      On December 20, 2021, shortly after the Appellate Division’s first\\n\\ndecision in this matter -- which applied the 2018 amendments to the Brokers\\n\\nAct only to contracts executed after the amendments’ effective date -- A. 6206\\n\\nwas introduced in the Legislature. The bill included the following proposed\\n\\naddition to N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2(b):\\n\\n            If a current or previously written agreement exists or\\n            existed between the broker and the broker-salesperson\\n            or salesperson that defines, sets forth, identifies, or\\n            provides that the broker-salesperson or salesperson is\\n            or at any time has been an independent contractor of the\\n            broker, the broker-salesperson or salesperson shall be\\n            deemed to be or have been an independent contractor\\n            during the period in which the agreement is or was\\n            effective and shall not be classified as an employee for\\n            any purpose under any law, rule, or regulation for that\\n            period of time, except that the broker-salesperson or\\n            salesperson shall satisfy the test set forth in [N.J.S.A.]\\n            43:21-19(i)(7)(K) in order to be deemed an independent\\n            contractor under [N.J.S.A.] 43:21-1 et seq. The broker-\\n            salesperson or salesperson shall not be required to\\n                                         21\\n              satisfy any other test for any other law, rule, or\\n             regulation, including, but not limited to, the tests set\\n             forth at or applied to [N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1 et seq.] and\\n             [N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a et seq.] to be deemed an\\n             independent contractor as provided in this section for\\n             purposes of any other law, rule or regulation.\\n\\n             [A. 6206.]\\n\\n      The Assembly Housing Committee Statement to A. 6206 provided that\\n\\nthe bill “reaffirms the intent of the Legislature, as stated in [L. 2018, c. 71] . . .\\n\\nthat broker-salespersons and salespersons who agree with a broker to be\\n\\nindependent contractors are not to be and historically have not been deemed\\n\\nemployees of the broker,” and that the bill also enforced “past written\\n\\nagreements regarding same.” A. Hous. Comm. Statement to A. 6206 (Dec. 13,\\n\\n2021). The Senate and General Assembly passed A. 6206, and sent it to\\n\\nGovernor Murphy for his signature.\\n\\n      Governor Murphy conditionally vetoed the bill. In his veto message, the\\n\\nGovernor noted that he had approved the 2018 amendments to the Brokers Act\\n\\n“providing that the business affiliation between a broker and a broker-\\n\\nsalesperson or salesperson may be that of an employment relationship or\\n\\nindependent contractor relationship.” Governor’s Veto Statement to A. 6206\\n\\n(2021). The Governor recognized that “[c]ourts have interpreted the Brokers\\n\\nAct as prospective in effect, applying to contracts for the period beginning\\n\\nAugust 10, 2018,” the date of the 2018 amendments to the Act. Ibid. He\\n                                         22\\n acknowledged that A. 6206 was passed “to reaffirm the intent of the\\n\\nLegislature as stated in the Brokers Act, regarding the employment\\n\\nrelationship or independent contractor relationship of real estate brokers, and\\n\\nto retroactively enforce past written agreements regarding same.” Ibid. The\\n\\nGovernor confirmed that he did “not object to the general intent of [A. 6206]\\n\\nto give certain provisions of the Brokers Act retroactive effect.” Ibid.\\n\\n      Governor Murphy expressed concern, however, about a different aspect\\n\\nof the proposed bill. Ibid. He stated that “several of the bill’s provisions, as\\n\\ndrafted, could be used as a basis for other employers in the State to misclassify\\n\\nworkers.” Ibid. The Governor criticized language in A. 6206 that “would\\n\\nimpose independent contractor-status upon an individual on the basis that the\\n\\nindividual is exempt from coverage under the UCL,” contrary to his\\n\\nAdministration’s position “that the UCL’s categorical exemptions are\\n\\nspecifically tailored to the context of unemployment benefits.” Ibid. He stated\\n\\nthat A. 6206, as passed by the Legislature, “could seriously erode the basic\\n\\nprotections afforded to employees by allowing employers to use a categorical\\n\\nUCL exemption as a basis to deem an employee an independent contractor\\n\\nnotwithstanding the particulars of that employee’s relationship with his or her\\n\\nemployer.” Ibid. The Governor observed that, notwithstanding A. 6206’s\\n\\nlimitation to real estate broker-salespersons or salespersons, “the legal theories\\n\\n                                        23\\n upon which the bill relies could be used by other employers across the State to\\n\\nmisclassify their employees as independent contractors.” Ibid.\\n\\n      Accordingly, Governor Murphy recommended that the Legislature delete\\n\\nthe terms that it had proposed to add to N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2(b), including the\\n\\nreference to the UCL provision, N.J.S.A. 43:21-19(i)(7)(K), that had raised\\n\\nconcerns about misclassification of employees outside the real estate industry.\\n\\nIbid. The Governor recommended new language stating that N.J.S.A. 45:15-\\n\\n3.2 “shall apply retroactively to enforce but not change any written agreement\\n\\nbetween a broker-salesperson or salesperson and a broker where the written\\n\\nagreement defines, sets forth, identifies or provides that the broker-salesperson\\n\\nis or was an independent contractor.” Ibid. He also recommended that the\\n\\namendments to the Brokers Act “be retroactive to August 10, 2018.” Ibid.\\n\\n      The Legislature agreed to the Governor’s recommended changes to A.\\n\\n6206. On January 18, 2022, it approved the final version of A. 6206. L. 2021,\\n\\nc. 486.\\n\\n                                       C.\\n\\n      Against that backdrop, we construe the Brokers Act as amended in 2018\\n\\nand 2022 to determine whether Kennedy may assert a claim under the WPL.\\n\\n      The plain language of the Brokers Act addresses the question raised by\\n\\nthis appeal. A real estate broker and a broker-salesperson or salesperson\\n\\n                                       24\\n seeking to conduct real estate activities must execute a written agreement\\n\\ndefining “the nature of the business affiliation” between the parties as either an\\n\\nemployment relationship or an independent contractor relationship. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n45:15-3.2(a), (b). The statute expresses no preference between the two\\n\\noptions; that question is for the parties to resolve. N.J.S.A. 45:15-3, -3.2; -14\\n\\nto -20.\\n\\n      Here, the real estate broker and the real estate salesperson agreed in\\n\\nwriting to affiliate in an independent contractor relationship, thus complying\\n\\nwith N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2(a) and (b). The Brokers Act expressly defines the\\n\\nconsequences of that choice; it provides that brokers and broker-salespersons\\n\\nor salespersons may affiliate in an independent contractor relationship,\\n\\n“[n]otwithstanding any provision of” the Brokers Act “or any other law, rule,\\n\\nor regulation to the contrary.” N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2(b). The Legislature’s use of\\n\\nthe word “notwithstanding” is significant; “[i]n construing statutes, the use of\\n\\nsuch a ‘notwithstanding’ clause clearly signals the drafter’s intention that the\\n\\nprovisions of the ‘notwithstanding’ section override conflicting provisions of\\n\\nany other section.” Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Grp., \\n508 U.S. 10\\n, 18 (1993).\\n\\nThus, in the Brokers Act, the Legislature clearly intended that if the parties’\\n\\nbusiness affiliation agreement under N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2 conflicts with another\\n\\nlaw, rule or regulation, the agreement will prevail.\\n\\n                                        25\\n       That legislative intent is underscored by changes to A. 6206 that\\n\\nGovernor Murphy recommended and the Legislature accepted in the 2022\\n\\namendments to the Brokers Act. L. 2021, c. 486; Governor’s Veto Statement\\n\\nto A. 6206 (2021). The import of the recommended deletions in the\\n\\nconditional veto is plain: the Governor eliminated a reference to a UCL\\n\\nexemption and other proposed language in the bill so that the Brokers Act\\n\\nwould not be invoked by employers in other industries in support of arguments\\n\\nthat their employees should be considered independent contractors. He acted,\\n\\nin short, to ensure that the statute would operate within its intended bounds.\\n\\nGovernor’s Veto Statement to A. 6206. 3\\n\\n      With respect to the real estate setting in which the Brokers Act applies,\\n\\nhowever, the Governor agreed with the Legislature that the 2018 amendments\\n\\n“shall apply retroactively to enforce but not change any written agreement\\n\\nbetween a broker-salesperson or salesperson and a broker where the written\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Relying on Governor Murphy’s conditional veto, Kennedy and amicus curiae\\nthe New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development urge a\\nnarrow construction of N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2. They contend that at most,\\nN.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2 mandates enforcement of the parties’ agreement to an\\nindependent contractor relationship only when a claim arises under the Brokers\\nAct itself and that the provision has no impact on the application of other\\nstatutes such as the WPL to real estate broker-salespersons or salespersons.\\nWe disagree. The interpretation of the Brokers Act urged by Kennedy and the\\nDepartment not only lacks support in the conditional veto message, but it\\ndirectly conflicts with the statutory language. See N.J.S.A. 45:15-3.2;\\nGovernor’s Veto Statement to A. 6206.\\n                                         26\\n agreement defines, sets forth, identifies or provides that the broker-salesperson\\n\\nor salesperson is or was an independent contractor.” L. 2021, c. 486. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n45:15-3.2’s plain language and the Governor’s conditional veto message are\\n\\nthus in accord.\\n\\n      Under the Brokers Act, the parties’ agreement to an independent\\n\\ncontractor affiliation is not merely one of several factors in the analysis, as the\\n\\nAppellate Division viewed it to be. See Kennedy, 474 N.J. Super. at 551. To\\n\\nthe contrary, if the parties have agreed in writing to a business affiliation in\\n\\ncompliance with the Brokers Act, that agreement is dispositive. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n45:15-3.2(b). If a written agreement entered into pursuant to N.J.S.A. 45:15-\\n\\n3.2 states that the broker-salesperson or salesperson is an independent\\n\\ncontractor, a court must enforce its terms.\\n\\n      Kennedy, who agreed in writing to affiliate with Weichert as an\\n\\nindependent contractor, must accordingly be treated as an independent\\n\\ncontractor “notwithstanding . . . any other law, rule, or regulation to the\\n\\ncontrary,” including the WPL. Ibid. For the period during which he worked as\\n\\na Weichert real estate salesperson, Kennedy was not subject to the ABC test\\n\\nthat governs employee classification disputes under the WPL pursuant to\\n\\nHargrove, \\n220 N.J. at 312-16\\n, or to any other classification standard set forth\\n\\nin statutes, regulations, or case law. Because he was an independent contractor\\n\\n                                        27\\n when he was affiliated with Weichert, Kennedy may not be deemed to have\\n\\nbeen Weichert’s employee under the WPL, see N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1(b), and he\\n\\nwas not covered by that statute. He cannot assert the claim set forth in his\\n\\ncomplaint, a misclassification claim premised on the WPL.\\n\\n      Accordingly, the trial court erred when it denied Weichert’s motion to\\n\\ndismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e).\\n\\n                                      IV.\\n\\n      The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed, and the matter is\\n\\nremanded to the trial court for an order dismissing Kennedy’s complaint.\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES SOLOMON, PIERRE-LOUIS,\\nWAINER APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE PATTERSON’s\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       28\\n '),\n",

(A-23-23) (088761)\\n\\nArgued May 1, 2024 -- Decided July 2, 2024\\n\\nFASCIALE, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court addresses two legal questions: (1) when is a Megan’s\\nLaw registrant who faces internet publication under N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2) entitled\\nto an evidentiary hearing to challenge the State’s proofs that the registrant’s conduct\\nestablished a pattern of compulsiveness and repetitiveness; and (2) whether, to\\nestablish that the registrant’s conduct constituted a pattern of compulsiveness and\\nrepetitiveness, the State may rely on a psychological report that had been prepared\\nfor sentencing purposes under N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3, for which the burden of proof is by\\na preponderance of the evidence, given that “Tier” classification determinations\\nrequire clear and convincing evidence.\\n\\n       In July 2016, then fourteen-year-old A.W. reported to police that her\\ngrandfather, petitioner R.S., had sexually molested her for two years. R.S. later\\nadmitted that he had touched his daughter in a similar manner when she was a minor.\\nR.S. was charged with one count of second-degree sexual assault against A.W. He\\npled guilty as charged and underwent a psychological examination to determine\\nwhether he should serve his sentence at the Adult Diagnostic Treatment Center at\\nAvenel (Avenel) pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3. The Avenel evaluator prepared a\\n2017 report and concluded that “[R.S.’s] repetitive criminal sexual behavior was\\nperformed compulsively,” and that R.S. was amenable and willing to participate in\\nsex offender treatment. The judge sentenced R.S. to four years at Avenel.\\n\\n       In June 2022, the Camden County Prosecutor’s Office notified R.S. that it\\nwould seek Tier Two (moderate risk of reoffense) classification and community\\nnotification with additional internet publication. Through counsel, R.S. challenged\\ntwo aspects of the State’s proposal. Pertinent to this appeal, R.S. argued he was\\nnever found to have engaged in “repetitive and compulsive” behavior by clear and\\nconvincing evidence as required for inclusion on the internet registry.\\n\\n       At the August 2022 Tier classification hearing, the assistant prosecutor\\nrequested that the Megan’s Law judge find by clear and convincing evidence that\\nR.S.’s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive and compulsive behavior.\\n                                          1\\n In response, the judge explained that R.S. “certainly would not have been eligible to\\nserve his sentence at [Avenel] if he was not found to be repetitive and compulsive”\\nand stated that she was “satisfied clearly and convincingly that [R.S.] is repetitive\\nand compulsive.” The Megan’s Law judge ordered Tier Two community\\nnotification, including internet publication. The Appellate Division affirmed that\\nportion of the judgment, determining that the Megan’s Law judge correctly found,\\nbased on clear and convincing evidence, that R.S.’s conduct was compulsive and\\nrepetitive. The Court granted certification. \\n256 N.J. 349\\n (2024).\\n\\nHELD: Under N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2), a Megan’s Law registrant is entitled to an\\nevidentiary hearing if the registrant demonstrates that there exists a genuine issue of\\nmaterial fact about whether the registrant’s conduct is characterized by a pattern of\\nrepetitive and compulsive behavior. The State may rely on an earlier psychological\\nreport that had been prepared pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3, but the independent\\nfindings by a Megan’s Law judge as to compulsivity and repetitiveness must be\\nbased on clear and convincing evidence.\\n\\n1. The Court reviews the history of Megan’s Law and the registration requirements\\nfor which it provides, including the 2000 amendment to the New Jersey Constitution\\npursuant to which the Legislature amended Megan’s Law to authorize internet\\npublication of certain sex offenders’ information. Through a 2014 amendment, the\\nLegislature broadened the reach of internet publication. Under that amendment,\\ncodified at N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2), an offender with a low or moderate re-offense\\nrisk will be placed on the internet registry if the underlying sex offense was found to\\nbe repetitive and compulsive pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3. N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3\\npermits a sentencing judge to impose a term of incarceration to be served at Avenel,\\nrather than in state prison, if first, a psychological examination of the offender\\n“reveals that the offender’s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive,\\ncompulsive behavior” and second, the sentencing judge likewise finds “the\\noffender’s conduct was so characterized” and also that the offender is both amenable\\nto and willing to participate in treatment. At the sentencing stage, such findings are\\nmade by a preponderance of the evidence. (pp. 13-19)\\n\\n2. In L.A. v. Hoffman, \\n144 F. Supp. 3d 649\\n (D.N.J. 2015), two convicted sex\\noffenders filed a class action lawsuit challenging the 2014 Megan’s Law amendment\\nmandating that certain sex offenders’ information -- i.e., those with a low or\\nmoderate risk of reoffending whose conduct was found to be repetitive and\\ncompulsive -- be published on the sex offender internet registry. The Hoffman\\nparties settled the case, and the district court entered a Consent Order in March 2017\\nmemorializing the agreement. Pursuant to that Consent Order, a registrant’s\\ninformation cannot be included on the internet registry unless the State “establishes\\nby clear and convincing evidence that the offender’s conduct was characterized by a\\npattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior.” The Administrative Office of the Courts\\n                                           2\\n subsequently directed that “the determination to include certain sex offenders on the\\nInternet Registry in accordance with the [Hoffman Consent Order], will be decided\\nby Megan’s Law judges upon completion of their tier classification and community\\nnotification hearing, and not at the time of sentencing.” (pp. 19-23)\\n\\n3. Recognizing that the parties agree they are bound by the Hoffman Consent Order,\\nthe Court holds that under N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2), a Megan’s Law registrant is\\nentitled to an evidentiary hearing if the registrant demonstrates there exists a genuine\\nissue of material fact about whether the registrant’s conduct at the time the underlying\\nsex offense was committed was compulsive and repetitive. The Court furthers hold\\nthat, for Tier classification purposes, the State may rely on a psychological report\\nprepared earlier pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3. However, the independent findings by\\na Megan’s Law judge as to compulsivity and repetitiveness must be made based on\\nclear and convincing evidence. When the State relies upon an Avenel report to meet\\nits burden by clear and convincing evidence, the registrant is not automatically\\nentitled to cross-examine the expert who authored the report. Registrants who wish\\nnot to introduce their own evidence but only to cross-examine an Avenel expert must\\npoint to a genuine issue of material fact with the expert’s report. Once that\\nprerequisite showing has been made, the Megan’s Law judge has discretion over the\\nscope of the limited evidentiary hearing. And whether an Avenel report alone\\nprovides clear and convincing evidence that a registrant’s conduct was repetitive and\\ncompulsive is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Megan’s Law judge.\\nBut the Megan’s Law judge may not rely simply on the Avenel expert’s conclusion in\\nthe report to support a finding that the registrant’s conduct was compulsive and\\nrepetitive; instead, the judge must identify aspects of the report on the record that\\nsupport the judge’s independent findings and conclusions. See R. 1:7-4(a). (pp. 23-28)\\n\\n4. Here, the Megan’s Law judge appears to have relied primarily on the 2017 Avenel\\nreport’s conclusion that R.S.’s behavior was in fact repetitive and compulsive. The\\nCourt remands to resolve whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted and,\\nirrespective of that determination, to allow the Megan’s Law judge to make\\nadditional findings and conclusions in accordance with Rule 1:7-4(a). The judge\\nmay continue to rely on the 2017 Avenel report when making independent findings\\nand conclusions regarding R.S.’s conduct but must identify aspects of the report on\\nthe record that support those independent findings and conclusions as to whether\\nR.S. was clearly and convincingly repetitive and compulsive. (pp. 28-29)\\n\\n      The judgment of the Appellate Division is VACATED as to the single issue\\nbefore the Court.

They\\n\\nagree further that those registrants may challenge the State’s proofs. For those\\n\\npositions, the parties rely on a Consent Order entered in L.A. v. Hoffman, \\n144\\n\\nF. Supp. 3d 649\\n (D.N.J. 2015).\\n\\n      In this appeal, we address two legal questions: (1) when is a Megan’s\\n\\nLaw registrant who faces internet publication under N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2)\\n\\n                                       2\\n entitled to an evidentiary hearing to challenge the State’s proofs that the\\n\\nregistrant’s conduct established a pattern of compulsiveness and repetitiveness;\\n\\nand (2) whether, to establish that the registrant’s conduct constituted a pattern\\n\\nof compulsiveness and repetitiveness, the State may rely on a psychological\\n\\nreport that had been prepared for sentencing purposes under N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3,\\n\\nfor which the burden of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence, given that\\n\\n“Tier” classification determinations require clear and convincing evidence.\\n\\n      Recognizing that the parties agree they are bound by the Hoffman\\n\\nConsent Order, we hold that under N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2), a Megan’s Law\\n\\nregistrant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if the registrant demonstrates\\n\\nthat there exists a genuine issue of material fact about whether the registrant’s\\n\\nconduct is characterized by a pattern of repetitive and compulsive behavior.\\n\\nWe further hold that the State may rely on an earlier psychological report that\\n\\nhad been prepared pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3, but we emphasize that the\\n\\nindependent findings by a Megan’s Law judge as to compulsivity and\\n\\nrepetitiveness must be based on clear and convincing evidence.\\n\\n      Here, the record must be more fully developed (1) to address whether an\\n\\nevidentiary hearing is warranted and (2) for the Megan’s Law judge to make\\n\\nfurther findings and conclusions. We therefore remand for further proceedings\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        3\\n consistent with this opinion. Internet publication remains stayed pending\\n\\nremand.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      In July 2016, then fourteen-year-old A.W. reported to police that her\\n\\ngrandfather, petitioner R.S., had sexually molested her for two years. 1 A\\n\\ndetective report summarized A.W.’s statements to the police as follows:\\n\\n            [A.W.] disclosed that [R.S.] would come into her\\n            room in the morning around 7:00 AM and would\\n            massage her body. [A.W.] would pretend to be\\n            sleeping. [R.S.] would touch her breast underneath\\n            her shirt with his hand and would squeeze her breast.\\n            [A.W.] further stated that [R.S.] would touch her\\n            vagina over her underwear. She said that this has\\n            occurred for two years on a daily basis, including this\\n            morning.\\n\\n      A.W.’s mother then telephoned R.S. and allowed detectives to listen to\\n\\nthe conversation. On that call, R.S. apologized for touching A.W. in the\\n\\nmanner A.W. had reported. The police then conducted a recorded interview of\\n\\nR.S. during which he admitted to touching A.W. in the mornings before he\\n\\nwent to work for the past two years, including that very morning. 2\\n\\n\\n1\\n  We refer to the individuals involved in this appeal by initials to protect their\\nprivacy. See R. 1:38-3(c)(9).\\n2\\n R.S. further admitted that he had touched his daughter in a similar manner\\nwhen she was a minor. Although R.S.’s daughter later confirmed to police that\\n                                      4\\n          R.S. was charged with one count of second-degree sexual assault against\\n\\nA.W., in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(b). R.S. pled guilty as charged and\\n\\nunderwent a psychological examination to determine whether he should serve\\n\\nhis sentence at the Adult Diagnostic Treatment Center at Avenel (Avenel)\\n\\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3. The Avenel evaluator prepared a 2017 report\\n\\nand concluded that “[R.S.’s] repetitive criminal sexual behavior was performed\\n\\ncompulsively,” and that he was amenable and willing to participate in sex\\n\\noffender treatment. Consequently, the judge sentenced R.S. to four years at\\n\\nAvenel. See N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(b) (providing that if a court finds that a sex\\n\\n“offender’s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive\\n\\nbehavior and that the offender is amenable to sex offender treatment and is\\n\\nwilling to participate in such treatment, the court shall” sentence the defendant\\n\\nto Avenel); State v. Howard, \\n110 N.J. 113\\n, 126-27, 131 (1988) (applying a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence standard to a finding under N.J.S.A. 2C:47-\\n\\n3(a)).\\n\\n         Before he was released from Avenel, R.S. underwent a second\\n\\npsychological evaluation in July 2019, in which the evaluator noted R.S.’s\\n\\nsatisfactory progress and release plans. Indeed, using the “STATIC-99R”\\n\\n\\nher father had repeatedly sexually assaulted her between the ages of twelve\\nand fourteen, the statute of limitations barred prosecution for R.S.’s offenses\\nagainst his daughter.\\n                                         5\\n scale, R.S.’s low score suggested he had a “very low” risk of reoffending.\\n\\nNevertheless, the July 2019 report recommended continued treatment upon\\n\\nrelease and that R.S. have “no unsupervised contact with female children.”\\n\\nAvenel released him in December 2019.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      In June 2022, the Camden County Prosecutor’s Office notified R.S. that\\n\\nhis Registrant Risk Assessment Scale (RRAS) score was forty-one, which\\n\\nreflected a moderate risk of reoffending, and that it would therefore seek Tier\\n\\nTwo classification and community notification with additional internet\\n\\npublication. The “Megan’s Law Statement of Reasons” attached to the notice\\n\\nstated in part that\\n\\n             [t]he State seeks internet notification. The State seeks\\n             notification to schools and community groups at the\\n             high and middle school levels. Normally [R.S.] would\\n             qualify for the incest exception [to internet\\n             notification] however due to his status as repetitive\\n             and compulsive AND the fact he has multiple victims\\n             overcomes the presumption against internet\\n             publication.\\n\\nIn addition to providing R.S. with the day, time, and location of his Megan’s\\n\\nLaw Tier classification hearing, the notice informed R.S. that he may object to\\n\\nthe proposed classification. The notice detailed the procedures for doing so,\\n\\nwhich included the submission of an “Application for Judicial Review” form.\\n\\n\\n                                        6\\n       Through counsel, R.S. challenged two aspects of the State’s proposal.\\n\\nFirst, R.S. argued his RRAS score should be reduced to thirty-six points,\\n\\nrelegating him to Tier One “low risk,” because he did not use “force” as\\n\\noutlined in the RRAS’s first factor. Second, and pertinent to this appeal, R.S.\\n\\nargued he was never found to have engaged in “repetitive and compulsive”\\n\\nbehavior by clear and convincing evidence as required for inclusion on the\\n\\ninternet registry. Relying on the Hoffman Consent Order, R.S. asserted that\\n\\n“while an offender’s repetitive and compulsive conduct need only be proven\\n\\nby a preponderance of the evidence for sentencing to [Avenel],” the standard is\\n\\nclear and convincing at a Tier classification hearing when the State seeks to\\n\\ninclude an offender on the internet registry. R.S.’s counsel stated that if the\\n\\nMegan’s Law judge finds R.S.’s conduct to be clearly and convincingly\\n\\nrepetitive and compulsive, then R.S. would be requesting an adjournment “for\\n\\nan updated psychosexual evaluation speaking to his repetitive and compulsive\\n\\ndesignation.”\\n\\n      At the August 2022 Tier classification hearing -- the only hearing\\n\\nconducted by the Megan’s Law judge in this case -- R.S. again objected to his\\n\\nRRAS score. The judge rejected R.S.’s argument that factor one (dealing with\\n\\nforce) should be low risk and instead found him to be moderate risk. She\\n\\ncalculated R.S.’s RRAS score as forty-one.\\n\\n                                        7\\n       The assistant prosecutor then requested that the Megan’s Law judge find\\n\\nby clear and convincing evidence that R.S.’s conduct be characterized by a\\n\\npattern of repetitive and compulsive behavior. In response, the judge\\n\\nexplained that\\n\\n            there was a finding from the Avenel report that I did\\n            review . . . that he was eligible for sentencing under\\n            the . . . sex offender statute . . . . It was Avenel who\\n            made the finding that h[is] [conduct] was repetitive\\n            and compulsive . . . . In fact, he served his sentenc[e]\\n            at [Avenel]. . . . He certainly would not have been\\n            eligible to serve his sentence at [Avenel] if he was not\\n            found to be repetitive and compulsive.\\n\\nThe judge elaborated that she reviewed the police reports and “the Avenel\\n\\nreport” and was “satisfied clearly and convincingly that [R.S.] is repetitive and\\n\\ncompulsive.” R.S.’s counsel moved to stay the Tier Two notification,\\n\\nincluding internet publication, and essentially argued that the State failed to\\n\\nmeet its burden of proof. R.S.’s counsel reiterated his request for an\\n\\nevidentiary hearing to challenge the State’s proofs that R.S.’s conduct could be\\n\\ncharacterized, clearly and convincingly, by a pattern of repetitive and\\n\\ncompulsive behavior.\\n\\n      The Megan’s Law judge ordered Tier Two community notification,\\n\\nincluding internet publication, but granted R.S.’s request for a stay to allow\\n\\nR.S. to either obtain a new psychological examination of his own and move for\\n\\nreconsideration or file an appeal. R.S. decided to appeal, and the Megan’s\\n                                        8\\n Law judge thereafter entered a second stay of the imposition of the Tier Two\\n\\nnotification requirements, including internet publication, pending disposition\\n\\nof the appeal.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division affirmed in part and reversed in part. The\\n\\nappellate court upheld internet publication, determining that the Megan’s Law\\n\\njudge correctly found, based on clear and convincing evidence, that R.S.’s\\n\\nconduct was compulsive and repetitive. It concluded that the Megan’s Law\\n\\njudge “engaged in an independent assessment” regarding the characterization\\n\\nof R.S.’s conduct and further noted that she relied on “all the other\\n\\ninformation” provided at the hearing in addition to the “unrebutted” 2017\\n\\nAvenel report. 3 Although the Appellate Division agreed that R.S. should be\\n\\nplaced on the sex offender internet registry, it nevertheless reversed in part,\\n\\nremanded, and directed that the Megan’s Law judge classify R.S. “as a Tier\\n\\nOne low-risk offender with a score of thirty-six.” 4\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  The August 2022 Tier hearing transcript reveals the “other information”\\nincluded police reports and witness statements.\\n4\\n  The State did not cross-appeal from the Appellate Division’s judgment\\ndirecting that the Megan’s Law judge classify R.S. as a Tier One, low-risk\\nreoffender. That issue is therefore not before us, but we note that under\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2), low-risk reoffenders whose conduct was repetitive and\\ncompulsive are also subject to internet publication.\\n                                        9\\n                                        D.\\n\\n      We granted R.S.’s petition for certification, \\n256 N.J. 349\\n (2024), and\\n\\nstayed publication on the internet registry pending appeal. We granted leave\\n\\nto the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU), the Association\\n\\nof Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL), and the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral, to participate as amici curiae.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      R.S. relies on the Hoffman Consent Order. He contends that he is\\n\\nentitled to “an adversarial evidentiary hearing” to challenge the State’s proofs\\n\\nthat his conduct could be characterized by a pattern of repetitiveness and\\n\\ncompulsiveness. He argues that a registrant is entitled to such a hearing upon\\n\\nmaking “specific arguments . . . challeng[ing] the finding of a previous\\n\\n[Avenel] report.”\\n\\n      R.S. further submits that a Megan’s Law judge cannot solely rely “on the\\n\\nsentencing court’s previous ‘repetitive and compulsive’ finding, made by a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence.” On that point, R.S. emphasizes that the\\n\\nMegan’s Law judge failed to “analyze any of the underlying information and\\n\\nreasoning” in his 2017 Avenel report before finding R.S. was clearly and\\n\\nconvincingly repetitive and compulsive. He argues that a registrant is\\n\\n                                       10\\n presumptively entitled to cross-examine the Avenel expert and may “always”\\n\\nchallenge a compulsive and repetitive designation by marshalling “expert or\\n\\ndocumentary evidence,” including evidence of subsequent therapeutic\\n\\ntreatment.\\n\\n      The ACLU supports R.S.’s arguments. Comparing the lower\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence burden of proof at sentencing to the higher\\n\\nclear and convincing standard at a Megan’s Law Tier classification hearing,\\n\\nthe ACLU argues that when the State has a higher standard of proof at a Tier\\n\\nclassification hearing, a registrant should be afforded a “full and fair\\n\\nopportunity to test the State’s proofs” by cross-examining or marshalling their\\n\\nown evidence. The ACLU cites to other court proceedings where a judge\\n\\npermits additional evidence “to achieve the level of accuracy that the relevant\\n\\nstandard of proof demands.”\\n\\n      The ACDL likewise supports R.S.’s position and argues that R.S. is\\n\\nentitled to a full evidentiary hearing. The ACDL discusses the various types\\n\\nof relevant evidence that should be considered at a Megan’s Law Tier\\n\\nclassification hearing and emphasizes that an Avenel report created for\\n\\nsentencing purposes “cannot alone be dispositive evidence” of a registrant’s\\n\\nrepetitive and compulsive conduct at the later Tier hearing. To allow\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        11\\n otherwise, the ACDL argues, would “erroneously” place registrants on the\\n\\ninternet registry.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      The State agrees that a Megan’s Law registrant facing a repetitive and\\n\\ncompulsive determination is entitled to “marshal evidence to rebut the State’s”\\n\\nproofs at the Tier classification hearing. According to the State, R.S. failed to\\n\\nchallenge the 2017 Avenel report’s “material facts or conclusions.” Had he\\n\\ndone so, the State concedes that “cross-examination and other evidence\\n\\nchallenging the State’s submission [would be] expected” at the Tier\\n\\nclassification hearing.\\n\\n      The State contends that evidence of a low STATIC-99R score and\\n\\nsubsequent therapeutic treatment speak to a registrant’s mindset after the fact,\\n\\nbut that N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2) focuses on the registrant’s mindset when they\\n\\ncommitted the underlying sex offense. Furthermore, the State recognizes that\\n\\nunder the Consent Order in Hoffman, it has the burden of proving the\\n\\nregistrant’s conduct was repetitive and compulsive by clear and convincing\\n\\nevidence. It submits however that it is possible for an initial Avenel report to\\n\\nmeet that standard.\\n\\n      The Attorney General generally supports the State’s position. The\\n\\nAttorney General agrees that under the Consent Order in Hoffman and other\\n\\n                                       12\\n Megan’s Law case precedent, the State must justify its proposed Tier\\n\\nclassification, including if it seeks internet publication, based on clear and\\n\\nconvincing evidence. Furthermore, the Attorney General does not dispute that\\n\\na registrant may be entitled to an evidentiary hearing. To warrant such a\\n\\nhearing, the Attorney General asserts that the registrant must “interpose[]\\n\\nobjections sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact” challenging that\\n\\nthe registrant’s conduct “was clearly and convincingly repetitive and\\n\\ncompulsive.” The Attorney General argues that R.S. failed to raise a genuine\\n\\nissue regarding whether his conduct was repetitive and compulsive and, thus,\\n\\nan evidentiary hearing was unwarranted.\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Following “the abduction, rape, and murder of seven-year-old Megan\\n\\nKanka by her neighbor,” who unbeknownst to Megan’s family was a convicted\\n\\nsex offender, In re Registrant H.D., \\n241 N.J. 412\\n, 419 (2020), the New Jersey\\n\\nLegislature enacted Megan’s Law in 1994, L. 1994, c. 133 (originally codified\\n\\nat N.J.S.A. 2C:7-1 to -11). The Legislature declared that “[t]he danger of\\n\\nrecidivism posed by sex offenders” requires certain sex offenders to register\\n\\nwith law enforcement officials. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-1(a). The registration system\\n\\nallows law enforcement “to identify and alert the public when necessary for\\n\\n                                        13\\n the public safety” in addition to providing law enforcement “with additional\\n\\ninformation critical to preventing and promptly resolving incidents involving\\n\\nsexual abuse and missing persons.” \\nId.\\n at -1(a), (b). Megan’s Law delegates\\n\\nresponsibility for implementing the registration and notification systems to\\n\\nvarious governmental institutions, including to the Attorney General and the\\n\\nAdministrative Office of the Courts. See, e.g., \\nid.\\n at -3(2).\\n\\n      In furtherance of its legislative purposes, Megan’s Law has two core\\n\\ncomponents: (1) law enforcement registration and (2) community notification.\\n\\nIn re Registrant M.F., \\n169 N.J. 45\\n, 52 (2001). The latter component requires\\n\\nlaw enforcement to “provide notification of [an] inmate’s release to the\\n\\ncommunity” where the inmate intends to live. In re N.B., \\n222 N.J. 87\\n, 95\\n\\n(2015); N.J.S.A. 2C:7-6.\\n\\n      Megan’s Law uses a risk-based “Tier” notification system where the\\n\\ndegree of community notification depends on how likely a sex offender is to\\n\\nreoffend. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-8(c). N.J.S.A. 2C:7-8(a) requires that the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral “promulgate guidelines and procedures for the notification” system.\\n\\nThe regulations are to “provide for three levels of notification depending upon\\n\\nthe risk of re-offense”: Tier Three (high risk) reoffender; Tier Two (moderate\\n\\nrisk) reoffender; and Tier One (low risk) reoffender. \\nId.\\n at -8(c)(1), (2), (3).\\n\\nWhen a registrant’s “risk of re-offense is low [(Tier One)], law enforcement\\n\\n                                        14\\n agencies likely to encounter the person registered shall be notified,” \\nid.\\n at\\n\\n-8(c)(1), but when the re-offense risk is moderate (Tier Two), “organizations\\n\\nin the community are also notified,” N.B., \\n222 N.J. at 95\\n (emphasis added)\\n\\n(citing N.J.S.A. 2C:7-8(c)(2)). When a registrant’s “risk of re-offense is high\\n\\n[(Tier Three)], notification is also given to members of the public who are\\n\\nlikely to encounter the registrant.” \\nIbid.\\n (emphasis added) (citing N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:7-8(c)(3)). 5\\n\\n      Moreover, the statute explicitly requires the Attorney General to\\n\\n“develop procedures for evaluation of the risk of re-offense and\\n\\nimplementation of community notification,” which must, at a minimum,\\n\\nrequire that the county prosecutor where the offender was convicted and the\\n\\ncounty prosecutor where the offender now lives assess the registrant’s re-\\n\\noffense risk together. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-8(d). The Attorney General Guidelines\\n\\nmandate that an offender on parole or probation be notified “of their duty to\\n\\nregister and that, upon registration, they will be subject to a determination by\\n\\nthe Prosecutor’s Office as to which tier is appropriate in their circumstances,\\n\\n\\n5\\n  The Attorney General Guidelines contain the RRAS, which is used to assess\\na sex offender’s re-offense risk. N.B., \\n222 N.J. at\\n95 n.3. An RRAS score is\\ncalculated by weighing several risk assessment criteria. \\nIbid.\\n “An RRAS\\nscore of 0 to 36 is low risk; 37 to 73 moderate risk; and 74 or more, high risk.”\\nIn re T.T., \\n188 N.J. 321\\n, 329 (2006) (citing Attorney General Guidelines for\\nLaw Enforcement for the Implementation of Sex Offender Registration and\\nCommunity Notification Laws).\\n                                        15\\n based upon an assessment of a risk of re-offense.” Attorney General\\n\\nGuidelines for Law Enforcement for the Implementation of Sex Offender\\n\\nRegistration and Community Notification Laws 8 (Attorney General\\n\\nGuidelines) (rev.

In addition to outlining the procedures for a\\n\\nregistrant’s Tier classification hearing where the State must prove that its\\n\\nproposed Tier designation and community notification are appropriate, the\\n\\nguidelines require that “[a]ll tier and scope of notification determinations made\\n\\nby the court . . . be embodied in the court order, including posting on the\\n\\nInternet Registry.” 6 Id. at 24, 28.\\n\\n      As technology advanced, so did the community notification requirements\\n\\nunder Megan’s Law. A 2000 amendment to the New Jersey Constitution\\n\\nempowered the Legislature “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this\\n\\nConstitution and irrespective of any right or interest in maintaining\\n\\nconfidentiality,” to enact laws to “authorize . . . disclosure to the general\\n\\n6\\n  In addition to the Attorney General Guidelines, this Court’s “Outline of\\nProcedures for Megan’s Law Cases” likewise provides procedural rules for\\nMegan’s Law Tier classification hearings. Outline of Procedures for Megan’s\\nLaw Cases (rev. Mar. 31, 2009). Recognizing that the Megan’s Law scheme is\\ncomplex and comprised of multiple authorities, our opinion today does not\\ndisrupt the way Megan’s Law judges have been conducting Tier classification\\nproceedings. Indeed, Megan’s Law judges have generally been following the\\nstandard we have outlined today. We anticipate that will continue and intend\\nour holding to be harmonious with current practices.\\n\\n                                        16\\n public of information pertaining to the identity, specific and general\\n\\nwhereabouts, physical characteristics and criminal history of persons found to\\n\\nhave committed a sex offense.” N.J. Const. art. IV, § 7, ¶ 12 (effective Dec. 7,\\n\\n2000). Pursuant to the constitutional amendment, the Legislature amended\\n\\nMegan’s Law in 2001 to authorize internet publication of certain sex\\n\\noffenders’ information. L. 2001, c. 167 (codified at N.J.S.A. 2C:7-12 to -19).\\n\\nIn addition to creating the New Jersey Sex Offender Internet Registry, the\\n\\nMegan’s Law amendment mandates that “information in the State registry\\n\\nabout certain sex offenders [be] publicly available on the internet.” N.B., \\n222\\n\\nN.J. at 95-96\\n; N.J.S.A. 2C:7-12. As originally enacted, only those sex\\n\\noffenders whose risk of re-offense was high or whose risk of re-offense was\\n\\nmoderate but did not fall within a statutory exemption were placed on the\\n\\ninternet registry. L. 2001, c. 167 § 2 (codified at N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b), (d)).\\n\\n      Through a 2014 amendment, however, the Legislature broadened the\\n\\nreach of internet publication. See L. 2013, c. 214 § 2 (codified at N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:7-13(b)(2)). That 2014 Amendment, which is central to this appeal,\\n\\nprovides that\\n\\n            [t]he public may, without limitation, obtain access to\\n            the Internet registry to view an individual registration\\n            record, any part of, or the entire Internet registry\\n            concerning all offenders . . . whose risk of re-offense\\n            is moderate or low and whose conduct was found to be\\n            characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive\\n                                       17\\n             behavior pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:47-\\n            3.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2).]\\n\\nThus, an offender with a low or moderate re-offense risk will be placed on the\\n\\ninternet registry if the underlying sex offense was found to be repetitive and\\n\\ncompulsive pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3. Ibid.\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3 is a “provision[] of the Code of Criminal Justice\\n\\nrelating to sex offenders” that “empower[s] the sentencing court to impose a\\n\\nsentence at Avenel.” Howard, \\n110 N.J. at 126\\n (emphasis added). After a\\n\\nconviction of certain sex crimes, N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3 permits a sentencing judge\\n\\nto impose a term of incarceration to be served at Avenel, rather than in state\\n\\nprison, if first, a psychological examination of the offender “reveals that the\\n\\noffender’s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive\\n\\nbehavior” and second, the sentencing judge likewise finds “the offender’s\\n\\nconduct was so characterized” and also that the offender is both amenable to\\n\\nand willing to participate in treatment. N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(a), (b) (emphasis\\n\\nadded). At the sentencing stage, such findings are made by a preponderance of\\n\\nthe evidence. Howard, \\n110 N.J. at 126-27, 131\\n. An Avenel report that\\n\\nconcludes an offender’s conduct was repetitive and compulsive plays a major\\n\\nrole in determining whether the offender should be sentenced to Avenel for\\n\\ntreatment. See N.J.S.A. 2C:47-1 to -3.\\n                                        18\\n       Megan’s Law and the statutory scheme dealing with alternative\\n\\nsentencing for sex offenders use the same “repetitive and compulsive”\\n\\nlanguage. Compare N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2), with N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3. In fact,\\n\\nMegan’s Law specifically applies to those “whose conduct was found to be\\n\\ncharacterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior pursuant to the\\n\\nprovisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3,” i.e., at sentencing. See N.J.S.A. 2C:7-\\n\\n13(b)(2) (emphasis added). In addition, although N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3 deals with\\n\\nsentencing and N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2) is relevant only after a sentence is\\n\\nserved, both statutes require a determination about whether the offender’s\\n\\nconduct -- i.e., the underlying sex offense -- was repetitive and compulsive\\n\\nviewed at the time the offender committed the offense. See In re Registrant\\n\\nD.F.S., \\n446 N.J. Super. 203\\n, 207-08 (App. Div. 2016) (“[T]he decision\\n\\nwhether . . . an offender’s individual registration record ‘shall be made\\n\\navailable to the public on the Internet registry’ depends on the nature of [the]\\n\\nsexual offenses at the time [the offender] committed them, and not on [the\\n\\noffender’s] mental condition at the time of the tier hearing.” (quoting N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:7-13(e))).\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      A challenge to the validity of the 2014 Amendment shortly followed its\\n\\nenactment. In Hoffman, two convicted sex offenders filed a class action\\n\\n                                       19\\n lawsuit challenging the 2014 Megan’s Law amendment mandating that certain\\n\\nsex offenders’ information -- i.e., those with a low or moderate risk of\\n\\nreoffending whose conduct was found to be repetitive and compulsive -- be\\n\\npublished on the sex offender internet registry, N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2). \\n144 F.\\n\\nSupp. 3d at 657\\n. The plaintiffs argued that the 2014 Amendment violated their\\n\\nstate and federal procedural due process rights because “their sentencing\\n\\nhearings only employed a preponderance of the evidence standard to find their\\n\\nconduct compulsive and repetitive,” whereas being placed on the internet\\n\\nregistry requires “an additional hearing to establish compulsive and repetitive\\n\\nbehavior by clear and convincing evidence after they have completed their\\n\\nstate-mandated treatment.” \\nId. at 668-69\\n.\\n\\n      The defendant, New Jersey’s Attorney General, moved to dismiss the\\n\\nplaintiffs’ complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim. \\nId. at 657\\n. The\\n\\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey granted the motion\\n\\nin part, dismissing all but the plaintiffs’ federal procedural due process claim.\\n\\nId. at 657\\n, 669 n.12.\\n\\n      As to the plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim emanating from the\\n\\nNew Jersey Constitution, the district court held that the 2000 Amendment to\\n\\nthe New Jersey Constitution “extinguish[ed] any privacy rights sex offenders\\n\\nmight have had vis-à-vis the [sex offender internet registry], thereby\\n\\n                                        20\\n abrogating the procedural due process rights that the [E.B. v. Verniero, \\n119\\n\\nF.3d 1077\\n (3d Cir. 1997)] court had found under the New Jersey Constitution.”\\n\\nId. at 669. But in allowing the plaintiffs’ federal procedural due process claim\\n\\nto continue, the court determined that the Third Circuit in A.A. v. New Jersey,\\n\\n341 F.3d 206\\n (3d Cir. 2003), “found sex offenders’ privacy interests in their\\n\\npersonal information emanates from the federal constitution” and that E.B.’s\\n\\nprocedural safeguards therefore still apply. \\nIbid.\\n Accordingly, the district\\n\\ncourt held that using a preponderance of the evidence standard “may deprive”\\n\\nthe plaintiffs of E.B.’s procedural protections and that “under the facts alleged,\\n\\nthe [Federal] Due Process Clause requires that the State prove [the plaintiffs’]\\n\\ncompulsivity and repetitiveness by clear and convincing evidence.” \\nId.\\n at 671-\\n\\n72.\\n\\n      The Hoffman parties subsequently settled the case, and the district court\\n\\nentered a Consent Order in March 2017 memorializing the agreement. Among\\n\\nother provisions, the parties agreed that\\n\\n            [t]he Internet registry record of any offender whose\\n            conduct was found on or after July 1, 2014 to be\\n            characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive\\n            behavior pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:47-\\n            3 under a “preponderance of the evidence” burden of\\n            proof whose risk of re-offense is moderate or low and\\n            for whom the court has not ordered notification in\\n            accordance with paragraph (2) of subsection c. of\\n            N.J.S.A. 2C:7-8 shall not be subject to public viewing\\n            on the Internet registry established pursuant to\\n                                       21\\n               N.J.S.A. 2C:7-12 et seq. unless and until the State, in\\n              a sentencing proceeding conducted pursuant to\\n              N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3, a Megan’s Law tier classification\\n              hearing or such other judicial proceeding as may be\\n              determined by the Administrative Office of the\\n              Courts, establishes by clear and convincing evidence\\n              that the offender’s conduct was characterized by a\\n              pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior.\\n\\n              [L.A. v.

The memorandum reiterated that (1)\\n\\n                                        22\\n the State’s burden of proving that a sex offender’s conduct was repetitive and\\n\\ncompulsive is by clear and convincing evidence, and (2) Megan’s Law judges\\n\\nare to “make the requisite findings at the tier classification hearing.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                       IV.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Recognizing that the parties agree they are bound by the Hoffman\\n\\nConsent Order, we hold that under N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2), a Megan’s Law\\n\\nregistrant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if the registrant demonstrates\\n\\nthere exists a genuine issue of material fact about whether the registrant’s\\n\\nconduct can be characterized by a pattern of repetitive and compulsive\\n\\nbehavior. 7\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n  The parties devote most of their respective briefs to discussions about\\nprocedural due process. We recognize the line of cases challenging the\\nconstitutionality of Megan’s Law both before and after the 2000 constitutional\\namendment. In this appeal, the parties do not challenge the effect, if any, that\\nthe 2000 Amendment may have on the Megan’s Law cases cited not only by\\nthe parties here, but also relied upon by the parties in Hoffman. Independent\\nof those references, the Hoffman Consent Order and subsequent AOC\\nMemorandum -- both of which do not mention any Megan’s Law cases --\\nsufficiently provide the basis for our holding. Indeed, the State and the\\nAttorney General particularly agree that: (1) they are bound by the Consent\\nOrder; (2) the State has the burden to prove at the Megan’s Law Tier\\nclassification hearing that the registrant’s conduct -- at the time it was\\ncommitted -- was clearly and convincingly repetitive and compulsive; and (3)\\na Megan’s Law registrant facing internet publication under N.J.S.A. 2C:7-\\n13(b)(2) who aptly challenges the State’s proofs is entitled to present evidence\\non the repetitive and compulsive characterization of their conduct.\\n                                         23\\n       To raise a genuine issue of material fact, the registrant must interpose\\n\\nmore than general denials, self-serving assertions, bald declarations, or vague\\n\\nand conclusory claims. Objections to the State’s characterization that a\\n\\nregistrant’s conduct constituted repetitive and compulsive behavior must be\\n\\nrooted in some reliable or credible evidence. Objections also must be material.\\n\\n“Materiality” bears upon whether the registrant’s conduct was clearly and\\n\\nconvincingly repetitive and compulsive at the time the underlying sex offense\\n\\nwas committed. Therefore, an objection must raise a genuine dispute about the\\n\\nregistrant’s repetitiveness and compulsiveness. Whether to conduct an\\n\\nevidentiary hearing -- and its scope -- should be left to the sound discretion of\\n\\nthe Megan’s Law judge, who should state on the record the reasons for\\n\\ngranting or denying such a hearing.\\n\\n      “It is black letter law that where a material factual matter is contested, it\\n\\ncannot be relied on without a resolution of the disputed evidence.” State v.\\n\\nHupka, \\n203 N.J. 222\\n, 241 (2010). In the summary judgment context, a\\n\\n“genuine issue as to any material fact” requires more than just disputing “facts\\n\\nwhich are immaterial or of an insubstantial nature, a mere scintilla, ‘[f]anciful,\\n\\nfrivolous, gauzy or merely suspicious.’” Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of\\n\\nAm., \\n142 N.J. 520\\n, 529 (1995) (first quoting R. 4:46-2; and then quoting\\n\\nJudson v. Peoples Bank & Tr. Co. of Westfield, \\n17 N.J. 67\\n, 75 (1954)). The\\n\\n                                        24\\n facts disputed must be about an issue that “might affect the outcome of the suit\\n\\nunder the governing law.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., \\n477 U.S. 242\\n, 248\\n\\n(1986) (defining materiality in the summary judgment context as dependent on\\n\\nthe applicable substantive law).\\n\\n      Similarly, in the post-conviction context, a defendant seeking post-\\n\\nconviction relief (PCR) may be entitled to an evidentiary hearing upon a\\n\\nshowing that “there are material issues of disputed fact that cannot be resolved\\n\\nby reference to the existing record.” R. 3:22-10(b). In fact, “[a] court shall\\n\\nnot grant an evidentiary hearing . . . if the defendant’s allegations are too\\n\\nvague, conclusory or speculative.” \\nId.\\n at (e)(2).\\n\\n      Those principles generally strike a balance between a party’s\\n\\n“opportunity to fully expose [its] case” and “reserv[ing] judicial manpower\\n\\nand facilities.” Brill, \\n142 N.J. at 541-42\\n (quoting Robbins v. City of Jersey\\n\\nCity, \\n23 N.J. 229\\n, 240-41 (1957)). We find no reason why those legal\\n\\nprinciples are not equally appropriate when a Megan’s Law registrant facing\\n\\ninternet publication under N.J.S.A. 2C:7-13(b)(2) seeks an evidentiary hearing\\n\\nto challenge the State’s characterization that a registrant’s conduct constituted\\n\\nrepetitive and compulsive behavior, especially given that the State and\\n\\nAttorney General agree that Megan’s Law registrants who adequately\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        25\\n challenge material facts, whether in an Avenel report or otherwise, are entitled\\n\\nto proffer evidence at a hearing.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      We further hold that, for Tier classification purposes, the State may rely\\n\\non a psychological report prepared earlier pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3. We\\n\\nemphasize, however, that the independent findings by a Megan’s Law judge as\\n\\nto compulsivity and repetitiveness must be made based on clear and\\n\\nconvincing evidence.\\n\\n      When the State relies upon an Avenel report to meet its burden by clear\\n\\nand convincing evidence, the registrant is not automatically entitled to cross-\\n\\nexamine the expert who authored the report. The State and Attorney General\\n\\nboth agree that a registrant may always challenge the State’s proofs that the\\n\\nregistrant’s conduct established a pattern of compulsiveness and repetitiveness\\n\\nby introducing their own evidence. But registrants who wish not to introduce\\n\\ntheir own evidence but only to cross-examine an Avenel expert must articulate\\n\\nwith particularity the reasons they need such an opportunity. That is, the\\n\\nregistrant must point to a genuine issue of material fact with the expert’s\\n\\nreport. Once that prerequisite showing has been made, which we anticipate\\n\\nwill be rare, the Megan’s Law judge has discretion over the scope of the\\n\\nlimited evidentiary hearing. We stress that the focus must be on identified\\n\\n                                       26\\n disputed issues of material facts -- those applicable to the State’s\\n\\ncharacterization that the registrant’s conduct constituted compulsive and\\n\\nrepetitive behavior -- which “cannot be resolved by reference to the existing\\n\\nrecord.” See R. 3:22-10(b), (d) (outlining when a PCR evidentiary hearing is\\n\\nnecessary and providing that when such a hearing is granted, the scope “shall\\n\\nbe limited to the issue of whether the defendant was improperly convicted”).\\n\\n      Furthermore, we do not foreclose the possibility that the State may\\n\\nsatisfy its burden of proof by relying solely on an Avenel report that found the\\n\\nregistrant’s conduct to be a pattern of repetitiveness and compulsiveness for\\n\\npurposes of sentencing. Whether an Avenel report alone provides clear and\\n\\nconvincing evidence that a registrant’s conduct was repetitive and compulsive\\n\\nis to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Megan’s Law judge. See In\\n\\nre Brady, \\n243 N.J. 395\\n, 411 (2020) (“Clear-and-convincing evidence is that\\n\\nwhich produce[s] . . . a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the\\n\\nallegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct and weighty and\\n\\nconvincing as to enable [the factfinder] to come to a clear conviction, without\\n\\nhesitancy, of the precise facts at issue.” (alterations and omission in original)\\n\\n(quoting In re Williams, \\n169 N.J. 264\\n, 271 (2001))).\\n\\n      Under those circumstances, the State is not required to produce more\\n\\nevidence to meet its burden, but the Megan’s Law judge must make specific\\n\\n                                        27\\n factual findings and conclusions about whether the State has met its clear and\\n\\nconvincing burden of proof. In other words, the Megan’s Law judge may not\\n\\nrely simply on the Avenel expert’s conclusion in the report to support a finding\\n\\nthat the registrant’s conduct was compulsive and repetitive. Instead, the\\n\\nMegan’s Law judge must identify aspects of the report on the record that\\n\\nsupport the judge’s independent findings and conclusions. See R. 1:7-4(a).\\n\\n                                      V.\\n\\n      Turning to this appeal, the Megan’s Law judge found that R.S.’s conduct\\n\\nwas clearly and convincingly repetitive and compulsive. She appears to have\\n\\nrelied primarily on the 2017 Avenel report’s conclusion that R.S.’s behavior\\n\\nwas in fact repetitive and compulsive. Although we ordinarily review a trial\\n\\njudge’s “conclusions regarding a Megan’s Law registrant’s tier designation\\n\\nand scope of community notification for an abuse of discretion,” In re\\n\\nRegistrant B.B., \\n472 N.J. Super. 612\\n, 619 (App. Div. 2022), we need not reach\\n\\nthat question here.\\n\\n      Instead, we remand to resolve whether an evidentiary hearing is\\n\\nwarranted and, irrespective of that determination, to allow the Megan’s Law\\n\\njudge to make additional findings and conclusions in accordance with Rule\\n\\n1:7-4(a). On remand, the Megan’s Law judge may of course continue to rely\\n\\non the 2017 Avenel report when making independent findings and conclusions\\n\\n                                      28\\n regarding R.S.’s conduct, but the remand judge must identify aspects of the\\n\\nreport on the record that support those independent findings and conclusions as\\n\\nto whether R.S. was clearly and convincingly repetitive and compulsive. See\\n\\nR. 1:7-4(a).\\n\\n                                     VI.\\n\\n      We therefore vacate the judgment of the Appellate Division as to the\\n\\nsingle issue before us, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with\\n\\nthis opinion.

J.C.\\n                               (A-8-23) (088071)\\n\\nArgued February 26, 2024 -- Decided May 29, 2024\\n\\nSOLOMON, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court considers whether a family court judge may dismiss\\nan action for the care and supervision of children brought pursuant to N.J.S.A.\\n30:4C-12 but continue restraints on a parent’s conduct.\\n\\n       The Division of Child Protection and Permanency (the Division) became\\ninvolved with J.C. (Jan) and her family in July 2018, when a hospital employee\\nnotified the Division that Jan had been involuntarily hospitalized for manic and\\nparanoid behavior. The Division implemented a safety plan that mandated\\ntemporary supervision of Jan’s contact with her children. Later, the Division lifted\\nthe plan. Following a referral in December 2019, when Jan admitted that she had\\nstopped seeing her therapist and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic\\nfeatures, the Division reinstituted the safety plan and filed a complaint. The Family\\nPart granted the Division care and supervision of the children. In March 2021, the\\nLaw Guardian sought to dismiss the Title 30 action because of Jan’s lack of\\ncooperation with the Division. The court discontinued the Division’s care and\\nsupervision of the children but dismissed the litigation with restraints, deeming it\\n“irresponsible” to allow Jan to have unsupervised contact with the children,\\nconsidering her mental health issues. The Appellate Division affirmed, and the\\nCourt granted certification, 255 N.J. 375 (2023).\\n\\nHELD: The family court does not have the authority under N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12 to\\ndismiss a Title 30 action -- and with it, a parent’s appointed counsel -- but continue\\nrestraints on a parent’s conduct. If the family court finds that it is in the best\\ninterests of the child to continue the restraints on a parent’s conduct, it must keep the\\ncase open to facilitate judicial oversight of the Division’s continued involvement,\\nwhile safeguarding a parent’s right to counsel.\\n\\n1. In DYFS v. I.S., the Court outlined the multi-step process set forth in N.J.S.A.\\n30:4C-12 which the Division must follow to properly exercise its authority under\\nTitle 30. 214 N.J. 8, 34 (2013). First, the Division must investigate following a\\n\\n                                           1\\n referral. If, as a result of the investigation, it appears that the child requires care and\\nsupervision by the Division or other action to ensure the health and safety of the\\nchild, the Division may apply for a court order. The family court must then hold a\\nsummary hearing and may issue an order for care and supervision if it is satisfied\\nthat the best interests of the child so require. Importantly, N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12\\nprovides that any order entered by the court is effective for six months, after which\\nthe Division may apply for an extension. If the court determines that an extension is\\nwarranted, care and supervision may be continued thereafter, provided there is\\nperiodic review by the family court. The purpose of periodic review is not to check-\\nup on and review a parent’s compliance or to manage the case, but rather to require\\nthe Division to demonstrate that continued care and supervision is still in the best\\ninterests because there is a need to ensure the child’s health and safety. The Court\\nnotes that indigent parents facing either temporary loss of custody or permanent\\ntermination of their parental rights have a right to appointed counsel in Title 30\\nproceedings in light of the magnitude of the consequences involved. (pp. 13-16)\\n\\n2. Here, the family court’s order terminated the Title 30 matter but maintained\\nrestraints upon Jan, which would result in the Division’s continued involvement with\\nthe family without the requisite judicial oversight. That is inconsistent with the\\nexpress provisions of N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12. A case should be dismissed only when the\\ncourt determines that neither services nor supervision are required to ensure the\\nchild’s health and safety. Thus, if the court finds that the Division established by a\\npreponderance of the evidence that restraints on a parent’s contact with her children\\nis in their best interests, the case should not be dismissed. Functionally, when a\\nTitle 30 action is terminated, so too is the right to the appointment of counsel.\\nTherefore, if a case is dismissed with continuing restraints, a parent with appointed\\ncounsel, like Jan, who seeks review in the future would not be entitled to the\\nassistance of counsel to begin that process, a result that is incompatible with due\\nprocess and a parent’s right to counsel in Title 30 proceedings. The Court is mindful\\nthat Title 30 requires the Division to regularly visit all children under its care and\\nthat criteria for determining the frequency and nature of in-person visits by a\\nDivision representative are established by regulation. Recognizing that periodic in-\\nperson visits to an intact family by a Division representative are inherently\\ndisruptive to the family in general and the children in particular, the Court explains\\nthat N.J.A.C. 3A:12-2.6 should be amended to provide an exception to regular\\nweekly or monthly visitation where the Division contends, and the family court\\nfinds, that the provision of services by the Division is not required.

To accomplish that goal, N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12 authorizes\\n\\nthe Division of Child Protection and Permanency (the Division) to seek a\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        2\\n temporary court order granting it care and supervision of a child, and the\\n\\nprovision of services to parents. DCPP v. I.S., 214 N.J. 8, 37 (2013).\\n\\n      A summary hearing is required within six months to review the order\\n\\ngranting the Division care and supervision, which may be extended by the\\n\\ncourt if it is in the child’s best interests. N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12. At these State-\\n\\ninitiated proceedings, parents are entitled to the assistance of counsel as a\\n\\nmatter of due process. DYFS v. B.R., 192 N.J. 301, 305 (2007).\\n\\n      We hold that the family court does not have the authority under N.J.S.A.\\n\\n30:4C-12 to dismiss a Title 30 action -- and with it, a parent’s appointed\\n\\ncounsel -- but continue restraints on a parent’s conduct. If the family court\\n\\nfinds that it is in the best interests of the child to continue the restraints on a\\n\\nparent’s conduct, it must keep the case open to facilitate judicial oversight of\\n\\nthe Division’s continued involvement, while safeguarding a parent’s right to\\n\\ncounsel.\\n\\n      We therefore reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment and remand to\\n\\nthe family court to reinstate the Title 30 action or dismiss the case without\\n\\nrestraints.\\n\\n                                          I.\\n\\n                                          A.\\n\\n      The following facts are undisputed.\\n\\n                                          3\\n       J.C. (Jan) and K.C. (Kyle) are the biological parents of two young\\n\\nchildren, A.C. (Andy) and W.C. (Wes). 1 The Division became involved with\\n\\nJan and her family on July 16, 2018, when a hospital employee notified the\\n\\nDivision that Jan had been involuntarily hospitalized for manic and paranoid\\n\\nbehavior. Following its investigation, the Division implemented a safety\\n\\nprotection plan that mandated temporary supervision of Jan’s contact with her\\n\\nchildren by either Kyle or Jan’s parents.\\n\\n      Later, the Division lifted the plan and was not involved with Jan or her\\n\\nfamily again until it received a referral from Andy’s school in March 2019,\\n\\ninforming the Division that Andy made a comment that Jan kept bombs in the\\n\\nfamily home. Finding the comment unsubstantiated, the Division\\n\\nrecommended behavioral services for Andy and closed the case. The Division\\n\\nreceived another referral concerning Andy’s behavior in July 2019 but did not\\n\\nfind their involvement was necessary.\\n\\n      On August 14, 2019, the Division received a referral from Andy’s in-\\n\\nhome behavioralist, reporting that Jan had sent him thirty-seven text messages\\n\\nindicating her belief that she was being surveilled. Kyle informed the Division\\n\\ncaseworker investigating the referral that Jan’s paranoia was worsening, and\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  We use initials and fictitious names to protect the privacy interests of the\\nparties and the confidentiality of the record. See R. 1:38-3(d)(12).\\n                                         4\\n Andy disclosed that he did not feel safe with Jan. The caseworker reported\\n\\nthat Jan became verbally aggressive during their conversation, prompting the\\n\\ncaseworker to call the police. Shortly thereafter, Jan was diagnosed with\\n\\n“unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.” Jan\\n\\nagreed to therapy, and Kyle represented that he and Jan’s parents would\\n\\nsupervise Jan’s contact with the children. The Division again closed the case.\\n\\n      The Division received a further referral in December 2019 from an\\n\\nacquaintance of Jan who reported that Jan claimed the neighbors and police\\n\\nwere tapping her phone and that she could not leave the house. After Jan\\n\\nadmitted to the caseworker that she had stopped seeing her therapist, the\\n\\nDivision reinstituted the safety plan. Jan ultimately consented to psychiatric\\n\\nand psychological evaluations. Both evaluators diagnosed Jan with bipolar\\n\\ndisorder with psychotic features and recommended therapy, psychiatric\\n\\nservices, and anti-psychotic medication.\\n\\n      On January 23, 2020, the Division filed a complaint pursuant to Title 9,\\n\\nalleging abuse and neglect, and Title 30, for care and supervision of the\\n\\nchildren. The Family Part granted the Division care and supervision of the\\n\\nchildren “to avoid an ongoing risk to the life, safety, or health of the children\\n\\nbecause of the mental health concerns for [Jan],” noting that “Andy\\n\\nparticularly has been very affected by being subject to his mother’s outbursts\\n\\n                                         5\\n and dysregulation.” It further ordered that Jan not be with the children\\n\\nunsupervised and prohibited her from transporting the children in a vehicle.\\n\\nThereafter, the Division offered services to assist Jan, referring her for\\n\\ncounseling and therapy, and offered counseling services to Kyle and Andy.\\n\\n      On March 24, 2020, the Division withdrew its abuse and neglect\\n\\ncomplaint under Title 9 but proceeded with its Title 30 action for care and\\n\\nsupervision. On June 1, 2020, the family court held a summary hearing\\n\\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12 and concluded that the Division’s care and\\n\\nsupervision of the children should continue. The court subsequently held\\n\\nseveral compliance review hearings pursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12, during\\n\\nwhich the Division advised the court that Jan participated in therapy and\\n\\ncounseling but that, according to Jan’s doctors, she resisted taking prescribed\\n\\nmedication and her mental health had not improved.\\n\\n      At a hearing on March 25, 2021, the Law Guardian, appointed to\\n\\nrepresent Andy and Wes, sought to dismiss the Title 30 action because of Jan’s\\n\\nlack of cooperation with the Division. The Division, in response, asked the\\n\\ncourt to consider dismissing the case with restraints. The Division formally\\n\\nrequested dismissal of the Title 30 matter at the next compliance hearing on\\n\\nJune 3, 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        6\\n                                         B.\\n\\n      At Jan’s request, prior to rendering its decision, the family court\\n\\nconducted a two-day dispositional hearing and heard testimony from Jan’s\\n\\ntreating psychologist, Dr. Franklin MacArthur, and a Division caseworker,\\n\\nLavar Parker. Dr. MacArthur testified that, because of Jan’s refusal to take\\n\\nprescribed medication, there had not been substantial progress in Jan’s mental\\n\\nhealth after over a year of treatment. In his view, Jan’s behavior negatively\\n\\nimpacted the children and continued supervision would be appropriate. Parker\\n\\nsimilarly testified that Jan persistently refused to take her medication and\\n\\ncontinued to exhibit delusional behavior, including screaming outside of her\\n\\nfamily home, using profanity, and yelling at her neighbors.\\n\\n      On August 12, 2021, the family court found by a preponderance of the\\n\\nevidence that Jan’s “mental health issues . . . which remain unabated cause a\\n\\nrisk to the safety and well-being of the children and that she’s not sufficiently\\n\\nstable to resume unsupervised contact.” The court found, however, that\\n\\nbecause Jan refused to take medication, the children were not benefiting from\\n\\nthe Division’s involvement and the court was satisfied that there were no\\n\\nadditional services the Division could provide to assist her. Thus, the court\\n\\ndiscontinued the Division’s care and supervision of the children but dismissed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        7\\n the litigation with restraints, deeming it “irresponsible” to allow Jan to have\\n\\nunsupervised contact with the children, considering her mental health issues.\\n\\n      The court’s order provided that\\n\\n             [Jan] is restrained from any unsupervised contact with\\n             the minor children. All contact to be supervised by\\n             [Kyle] or the maternal grandparents.\\n\\n             [Jan] is prohibited from transporting the children in a\\n             vehicle.\\n\\n             Should [Jan] seek to lift the restraint, on notice to the\\n             Division, [Jan] must address any mental health\\n             concerns, comply with all treatment recommendations\\n             including [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy] and\\n             psychiatric treatment with a Board Certified adult\\n             psychiatrist and demonstrate a level of sustained\\n             stability.\\n\\nJan appealed that order.\\n\\n                                         C.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division affirmed the family court’s order. The court\\n\\nrejected Jan’s argument that the family court could not dismiss a Title 30\\n\\naction with ongoing restraints, explaining that “[a]lthough care and supervision\\n\\nunder Title 30 is generally a temporary relief, nothing in Title 30 expressly\\n\\nprecludes ongoing protections when the case is closed.” (citation omitted).\\n\\n      The appellate court further reasoned that the “family court did not enter\\n\\npermanent restraints,” but instead “continued the restraints that existed during\\n\\nthe litigation,” which Jan can “apply to lift . . . if she can show that she is\\n                                          8\\n stable and complying with treatment.” The appellate court concluded that\\n\\nthere is “nothing inconsistent with Title 30 in allowing those continued\\n\\nrestraints.” The court accordingly was satisfied that the remedy was within the\\n\\nfamily court’s authority under Title 30 and consistent with the best interests of\\n\\nthe children. 2\\n\\n                                       D.\\n\\n      We granted Jan’s petition for certification, limited to whether the\\n\\nChancery Division, Family Part “has authority, under N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12, to\\n\\ndismiss [the Title 30 complaint] when there are continuing restraints in place.”\\n\\n255 N.J. 375, 375-76 (2023). We also granted the application of the American\\n\\nCivil Liberties Union (ACLU) to appear as amicus curiae.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Jan urges the Court to reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment and\\n\\nremand the matter to the Family Part to either dismiss the restraints or reinstate\\n\\nthe Title 30 action. Jan contends that any relief ordered by the court under\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  The Appellate Division also rejected Jan’s contention that there was\\ninsufficient evidence to support leaving the restrictions in place and\\ndetermined that the family court properly admitted into evidence a summary\\nreport of a counsellor from Family First. Those issues are not part of this\\nappeal.\\n                                        9\\n N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12 does not survive dismissal of the case because there could\\n\\nbe no statutorily mandated judicial oversight and periodic status hearings.\\n\\nTherefore, once the family court dismissed the Title 30 complaint against Jan,\\n\\nshe claims the family court no longer had the authority to impose continuing\\n\\nrestraints pursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12.\\n\\n      Jan further argues that the order was flawed because it did not provide\\n\\nfor her continued mental health services and did not require the Division to\\n\\nreturn periodically to court to maintain the restraints. Jan asserts that the\\n\\ncourt’s order dismissing the Title 30 matter ended Jan’s right to the assistance\\n\\nof state-appointed counsel and required that any effort to contest the restraints\\n\\nwould need to be initiated by Jan pro se or with the aid of private counsel.\\n\\n      Amicus curiae ACLU agrees that closing the Title 30 matter denies Jan\\n\\nher right to state-appointed representation in any future proceeding to contest\\n\\nthe restraints. It urges that, if the Appellate Division’s decision is affirmed,\\n\\ndue process requires that counsel be appointed to represent Jan in any future\\n\\nproceeding to terminate or modify restraints, at no cost to her.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      The Division argues that relief ordered under Title 30 varies case by case\\n\\nand the Appellate Division appropriately found that there is “nothing in Title\\n\\n30 [that] expressly precludes ongoing protections when the case is closed.”\\n\\n                                        10\\n The Division further contends that periodic status hearings are only required\\n\\nwhen the Division seeks to maintain judicial oversight of a parent to ensure a\\n\\nchild’s safety. Because the Division requested dismissal of the case following\\n\\nits determination that its continued involvement was no longer necessary, it\\n\\nsubmits that continuing restraints did not trigger the need for periodic review\\n\\nhearings.\\n\\n      The Law Guardian supports the Division’s position and argues that the\\n\\nfamily court has discretion to dismiss a case yet continue restraints to protect\\n\\n“the children’s health and safety.”\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      We review de novo the construction of N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12 and “owe no\\n\\ndeference ‘to the Appellate Division’s or trial court’s interpretive conclusions’\\n\\nabout the meaning of [the] statute.” DCPP v. J.R.-R., 248 N.J. 353, 368\\n\\n(2021) (quoting DCPP v. Y.N., 220 N.J. 165, 177 (2014)).\\n\\n      In our examination of N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12, the Court’s goal is to discern\\n\\nand effectuate the Legislature’s intent. DYFS v. A.L., 213 N.J. 1, 20 (2013).\\n\\nWe start with the statutory language, “ascribing to the statute’s words ‘their\\n\\nordinary meaning and significance.’” DCPP v. D.C.A., 256 N.J. 4, 19 (2023)\\n\\n(quoting W.S. v. Hildreth, 252 N.J. 506, 518-19 (2023)). “When the plain\\n\\n                                       11\\n language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we apply the law as written.”\\n\\nHildreth, 252 N.J. at 518.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      We have described New Jersey’s child welfare laws as balancing “a\\n\\nparent’s constitutionally protected right ‘to raise a child and maintain a\\n\\nrelationship with that child, without undue influence by the [S]tate,’ and ‘the\\n\\nState’s parens patriae responsibility to protect the welfare of children.’”\\n\\nD.C.A., 256 N.J. at 20 (quoting J.R.-R., 248 N.J. at 368). That balance is\\n\\nstruck by two parallel but distinct statutory schemes: Title 9 and Title 30.\\n\\nA.L., 213 N.J. at 18.\\n\\n      Title 9 authorizes Division involvement where there is child abuse or\\n\\nneglect, providing “interim relief for children at risk and outlin[ing] the\\n\\nstandards for abuse and neglect proceedings against parents and guardians.”\\n\\nIbid. “The focus of proceedings initiated under Title 9 is assurance that ‘the\\n\\nlives of innocent children are immediately safeguarded from further injury.’”\\n\\nDYFS v. I.S., 422 N.J. Super. 52, 67-68 (App. Div. 2011) (quoting N.J.S.A.\\n\\n9:6-8.8(a)), rev’d on other grounds, 214 N.J. 8 (2013).\\n\\n      In a Title 30 proceeding, in contrast, the focus is on “‘whether or not it is\\n\\nin the child’s best interest to preserve the family unit,’ with the child’s health\\n\\nand safety being the paramount concern of our Legislature.” Id. at 68 (quoting\\n\\n                                        12\\n N.J.S.A. 30:4C-1(a)). To that end, N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12 enables “the Division to\\n\\neffectuate services to children in need when a parent does not consent to the\\n\\nDivision’s supervision, care, or custody.” I.S., 214 N.J. at 33.\\n\\n      The Division may implement various forms of relief to assist families,\\n\\nfrom “minimally intrusive” measures, “such as when the Division provides\\n\\ncounseling and referral services to families, to “guardianship and termination\\n\\nof parental rights.” I.S., 422 N.J. Super. at 68. Relevant here, “the Division\\n\\ncan seek a court order to intervene and require a [parent] to undergo treatment,\\n\\nor seek other relief.” I.S., 214 N.J. at 33 (alteration in original) (quoting A.L.,\\n\\n213 N.J. at 9). “[I]n deciding what services a parent should be ordered to\\n\\naccept in a child’s best interests, the court should focus on the need to ensure\\n\\nthe health and safety of children.” DYFS v. T.S., 426 N.J. Super. 54, 65-66\\n\\n(App. Div. 2012).\\n\\n      In I.S., we outlined the multi-step process set forth in N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12\\n\\nwhich the Division must follow to properly exercise its authority under Title\\n\\n30. 214 N.J. at 34. The first step is a referral to the Division by any person\\n\\nwith an interest in the child “whenever it shall appear” that a parent or\\n\\nguardian “fail[s] to ensure the health and safety of the child, or is endangering\\n\\nthe welfare of [the] child.” N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12. The Division’s receipt of a\\n\\nreferral prompts a mandatory investigation. Ibid. If, as a result of the\\n\\n                                        13\\n investigation, “it appears that the child requires care and supervision by the\\n\\n[D]ivision or other action to ensure the health and safety of the child, the\\n\\n[D]ivision may apply to the Family Part” for an order “placing the child under\\n\\nthe care and supervision or custody of the [D]ivision.” Ibid.\\n\\n      Following the Division’s application to the Family Part,\\n\\n             [t]he court, at a summary hearing held upon notice to\\n             the [D]ivision, and to the parent, parents, guardian, or\\n             person having custody and control of the child, if\\n             satisfied that the best interests of the child so require,\\n             may issue an order as requested, which order shall have\\n             the same force and effect as the acceptance of a child\\n             for care by the [D]ivision as provided in [N.J.S.A.\\n             30:4C-11]; provided, however, that such order shall not\\n             be effective beyond a period of six months from the\\n             date of entry unless the court, upon application by the\\n             [D]ivision, at a summary hearing held upon notice to\\n             the parent, parents, guardian, or person having custody\\n             of the child, extends the time of the order.\\n\\n             [Ibid. (emphases added).]\\nThus, the court must hold a summary hearing and may issue an order for care\\n\\nand supervision if it is “satisfied that the best interests of the child so require.”\\n\\nIbid. The Division has the burden to prove “by a preponderance of the\\n\\nevidence that it is in the best interests of the child to enter the relief\\n\\nrequested.” I.S., 214 N.J. at 38.\\n\\n      Importantly, N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12 provides that any order entered by the\\n\\ncourt is effective for six months. If the Division believes services will be\\n\\n\\n                                          14\\n needed beyond that point, “the Division may apply for an extension of that\\n\\norder, requesting a summary hearing and disposition on its request.” Id. at 37\\n\\n(citing N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12). Thereafter, “‘upon notice to the parent,’ the court\\n\\n-- in its discretion -- may extend the order provided that it is satisfied, by the\\n\\npreponderance of the credible evidence, that the best interests of the child\\n\\nrequire continuation of that order.” Id. at 37-38 (quoting N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12).\\n\\nCare and supervision may be continued thereafter, provided there is periodic\\n\\nreview by the family court. See ibid.\\n\\n      Those statutorily required periodic hearings are “to ensure appropriate\\n\\ncourt oversight of the Division’s plans for the child.” Id. at 38. The purpose\\n\\nof periodic review “is not to check-up on and review a parent’s compliance or\\n\\nto manage the case,” but rather “to require the Division to demonstrate that\\n\\ncontinued care and supervision is still in the best interests because there is a\\n\\nneed to ensure the child’s health and safety.” T.S., 426 N.J. Super. at 66-67.\\n\\nThe objective is to determine, after the passage of time, whether the reasons\\n\\nfor granting care and supervision to the Division still exist. Thus, in addition\\n\\nto authorizing action by the Division, the Legislature placed checks on the\\n\\nDivision in N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12. Those cannot be ignored by the courts.\\n\\n      As for abuse and neglect charges under Title 9, indigent parents facing\\n\\neither temporary loss of custody or permanent termination of their parental\\n\\n                                         15\\n rights have a right to appointed counsel in Title 30 proceedings “in light of the\\n\\nmagnitude of the consequences involved.” Crist v. DYFS, 135 N.J. Super.\\n\\n573, 575 (App. Div. 1975), aff’g in part and rev’g in part, 128 N.J. Super. 402\\n\\n(Law Div. 1974). 3 It is “the due process guarantee of Article I, paragraph 1 of\\n\\nthe New Jersey Constitution [that] serves as a bulwark against the loss of\\n\\nparental rights without counsel being afforded.” 4 B.R., 192 N.J. at 305 (citing\\n\\nPasqua v. Council, 186 N.J. 127, 147 n.5 (2006)). Thus, an unrepresented\\n\\nparent facing a State-initiated temporary loss of custody or termination\\n\\nproceeding would constitute a “fundamental deprivation of procedural due\\n\\nprocess.” In re Adoption of J.E.V., 226 N.J. 90, 105 (2016) (quoting Crist,\\n\\n128 N.J. Super. at 415). The Legislature accordingly passed N.J.S.A. 30:4C-\\n\\n15.4(c), which authorizes the court to appoint the Office of the Public\\n\\nDefender to represent an indigent parent in any action concerning the\\n\\ntemporary loss of custody or termination of parental rights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  A child’s right to the assistance of counsel in child protection and\\ndependency matters is also statutorily and constitutionally recognized. See\\nDYFS v. Wandell, 155 N.J. Super. 302, 306 (J. & D.R. Ct. 1978).\\n4\\n  Article I, Paragraph 1 of the State Constitution provides that “[a]ll persons\\nare by nature free and independent, and have certain natural and unalienable\\nrights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of\\nacquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining\\nsafety and happiness.”\\n                                       16\\n                                          C.\\n\\n      Here, the family court’s order terminated the Title 30 matter but\\n\\nmaintained restraints upon Jan. The order would result in the Division’s\\n\\ncontinued involvement with the family without the requisite judicial oversight.\\n\\nSuch an action is inconsistent with the express provisions of N.J.S.A. 30:4C-\\n\\n12. A case should be dismissed only when the court determines that neither\\n\\nservices nor supervision are required to ensure the child’s health and safety.\\n\\nSee T.S., 426 N.J. Super. at 66 (“Absent a showing that services or supervision\\n\\nor both appear to be in the best interests of child . . . , a case should be\\n\\ndismissed.”). Thus, if the court finds that the Division established by a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence that restraints on a parent’s contact with her\\n\\nchildren is in their best interests, the case should not be dismissed.\\n\\n      Functionally, when a Title 30 action is terminated, as was the case here,\\n\\nso too is the right to the appointment of counsel. See DCPP v. S.D., 453 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 511, 525 (App. Div. 2018). Therefore, if a case is dismissed with\\n\\ncontinuing restraints, a parent with appointed counsel, like Jan, who seeks\\n\\nreview in the future would not be entitled to the assistance of counsel to begin\\n\\nthat process, unless the parent has the means to hire private counsel to do so.\\n\\nIndeed, the Family Part’s order in this case requires Jan to initiate review of\\n\\nthe restraints, but the Office of the Public Defender confirmed that they no\\n\\n                                         17\\n longer represented Jan following dismissal of the action. We find this result\\n\\nincompatible with due process and a parent’s right to counsel in Title 30\\n\\nproceedings. 5\\n\\n      Lastly, we are mindful that Title 30 requires the Division to regularly\\n\\nvisit all children under its care “to assure the maximum benefit from such\\n\\nservices.” N.J.S.A. 30:4C-25. The criteria for determining the frequency and\\n\\nnature of in-person visits by a Division representative are established by\\n\\nregulation. See N.J.A.C. 3A:12-2.1 to -2.11. N.J.A.C. 3A:12-2.6(c) mandates\\n\\nthat a Division representative create a schedule for in-person visitation to\\n\\nrange between weekly and monthly, except as provided in N.J.A.C. 3A:12-\\n\\n2.6(d) and (f), which allow a Division representative to schedule in-person\\n\\nvisitation once every three months when a child resides out-of-state.\\n\\n      We recognize here that periodic in-person visits to an intact family by a\\n\\nDivision representative are inherently disruptive to the family in general and\\n\\nthe children in particular. They are an interruption of the family routine\\n\\ninitiated by a third party who may conduct interviews of family members and\\n\\nexamine the family surroundings. Therefore, when a case plan establishing the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  Keeping the case open will additionally ensure that the Law Guardian will\\nreceive notice of all proceedings and continue to represent the children’s\\ninterests.\\n                                       18\\n schedule for in-person visitation does not express a need for services, regular\\n\\nvisitation pursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4C-25 may not be required. See N.J.A.C.\\n\\n3A:12-2.6(a). In those circumstances, a visitation schedule of once every three\\n\\nto six months may be approved by the family court, in its discretion. See\\n\\nN.J.A.C. 3A:12-2.6(f), (g). To harmonize those concerns, N.J.A.C. 3A:12-2.6\\n\\nshould be amended to provide an exception to regular weekly or monthly\\n\\nvisitation where the Division contends, and the family court finds, that the\\n\\nprovision of services by the Division is not required.\\n\\n      In sum, because of a parent’s due process right to counsel in Title 30\\n\\nproceedings, and the express provisions of N.J.S.A. 30:4C-12, we require the\\n\\nChancery Court, Family Part to keep a case open if it determines that the\\n\\nprovision of care, supervision, or services to a parent, parents, or child is in the\\n\\nbest interests of the child, or that continuing restraints on a parent’s conduct\\n\\nare necessary to ensure a child’s health and safety.\\n\\n                                        IV.\\n\\n      The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed, and the matter is\\n\\nremanded to the Family Part to reinstate the Title 30 action or dismiss the case\\n\\nwithout restraints.\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, PIERRE-LOUIS,\\nWAINER APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE SOLOMON’s\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n                                        19\\n '),\n",

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n                       State v. Kalil Cooper (A-35-22) (087742)\\n\\nArgued September 27, 2023 -- Decided March 27, 2024\\n\\nNORIEGA, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court reviews defendant Kalil Cooper’s conviction for\\npromoting organized street crime, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30, and determines\\nwhether the statute contains within it, as a predicate offense, the crime of conspiracy\\nto distribute a controlled dangerous substance (CDS).\\n\\n       Defendant was arrested following a wiretap investigation into the activities of\\na local gang. Defendant was individually charged with twelve separate counts,\\nincluding two counts of racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering, in\\nviolation of N.J.S.A. 2C:41-1, and one count of promoting organized street crime in\\nviolation of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30 (count four). The promoting count charged that\\ndefendant “purposefully conspire[d] with others . . . to commit a continuing series of\\ncrimes which constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under the provisions of\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:4l-l, contrary to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30.”\\n\\n        During the jury charge conference, defendant objected to count four of the\\nindictment, arguing that N.J.S.A. 2C:41-1’s “pattern of racketeering activity,” was\\nnot a predicate offense of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30. The trial court agreed, but instead of\\nstriking that count, it amended the indictment by incorporating offenses relevant to\\nthe racketeering charge as predicate offenses to count four’s promoting charge. The\\ntrial court reasoned that defendant was on notice of those offenses based on their\\ninclusion elsewhere in the indictment and that these offenses were also predicate\\noffenses of the promoting statute. Thus, as to count four, the trial court instructed\\nthe jury in part that the State must prove “[t]hat the purpose of the conspiracy was to\\ncommit the crime of conspiracy to commit murder and/or aggravated assault and/or\\nconspiracy to distribute a controlled dangerous substance.” (emphases added).\\n\\n      The jury returned guilty verdicts on four counts, including the promoting\\ncharge. According to the verdict sheet, the jury found defendant guilty of\\nconspiracy to distribute CDS as the predicate offense of promoting. At sentencing,\\ndefendant unsuccessfully renewed his challenge to count four and the jury charge.\\n\\n\\n                                           1\\n The Appellate Division affirmed. The Court granted defendant’s petition for\\ncertification. 253 N.J. 404 (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Conspiracy to distribute CDS is not an enumerated predicate offense of the\\npromoting statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30, and defendant’s conviction for a crime that\\ndoes not exist must be vacated.\\n\\n1. N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30(a) provides in relevant part that “[a] person promotes\\norganized street crime if he conspires with others . . . to commit any crime specified\\nin” one of several enumerated chapters of Title 2C of the New Jersey statutes or one\\nof the additional statutes listed from chapters 34 and 39 of Title 2C. To prove\\n“promoting,” the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the accused conspired\\nto commit at least one offense on that specific list of predicate offenses.\\nConspicuously absent from that list is the substantive offense of conspiracy pursuant\\nto N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2. The offense of conspiracy is not listed as a predicate offense\\nitself, nor is it specified within any of the enumerated chapters as a predicate offense\\nof the promoting statute. The jury instruction in this case thus erroneously departed\\nfrom the list of permissible predicate offenses in N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30(a) and\\nerroneously opened to the jury the possibility of convicting defendant for conspiracy\\nto conspire to distribute CDS, a crime that does not exist because conspiracy to\\ndistribute CDS is not a predicate offense under the promoting statute. (pp.13-15)\\n\\n2. If the party contesting the jury instruction fails to object to it at trial, the standard\\non appeal is one of plain error; if the party objects, the review is for harmless error.\\nDefendant raised an objection to the now-challenged jury instruction at various\\npoints leading up to, during, and through the end of the trial. The issue was properly\\npreserved, thus the Court reviews for harmless error. (pp. 15-19)\\n\\n3. Defendant was convicted and sentenced based upon a charge that does not exist\\nwithin the criminal code. Such a result is not harmless, but rather unjust.

Individually, defendant was charged in twelve separate\\n\\ncounts, three of which are relevant to this appeal: two counts of racketeering\\n\\nand conspiracy to commit racketeering, in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:41-1, and\\n\\none count of promoting organized street crime in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-\\n\\n30 (promoting). The promoting count charged that defendant “purposefully\\n\\nconspire[d] with others . . . to commit a continuing series of crimes which\\n\\nconstitute a pattern of racketeering activity under the provisions of N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:4l-l, contrary to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30.”\\n\\n      During the jury charge conference, defendant objected to count four of\\n\\nthe indictment, arguing that N.J.S.A. 2C:41-1’s “pattern of racketeering\\n\\nactivity,” was not a predicate offense of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30. The trial court\\n\\nagreed, but instead of striking that count, it amended the indictment by\\n\\n                                        2\\n incorporating offenses relevant to count three’s racketeering charge as\\n\\npredicate offenses to count four’s promoting charge. The trial court reasoned\\n\\nthat defendant was on notice of those offenses based on their inclusion\\n\\nelsewhere in the indictment and, critical here, that these offenses were also\\n\\npredicate offenses of the promoting statute pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30.\\n\\nThe Appellate Division affirmed the trial court’s interpretation of the statute.\\n\\n      For the reasons set forth below, we hold that decision was incorrect.\\n\\nConspiracy to distribute CDS is not an enumerated predicate offense of the\\n\\npromoting statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30. We therefore reverse the Appellate\\n\\nDivision’s judgment and vacate defendant’s conviction on count four.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n      Defendant was arrested at the end of a month-long wiretap investigation\\n\\ninto the activities of a local gang believed to operate in Elizabeth, known as\\n\\nthe Grape Street Crips. Defendant was targeted in the investigation as one of\\n\\nthe possible “leaders” of the organization. The investigation produced\\n\\nhundreds of hours of phone call recordings, along with text messages, in\\n\\naddition to evidence from police witnesses, all supporting the theory that the\\n\\ntargets of the investigation were operating as a gang. As it pertained to\\n\\ndefendant, the investigation revealed numerous calls between defendant and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        3\\n others regarding the alleged purchase and sale of heroin and cocaine, usually\\n\\ndiscussed in code.\\n\\n      A Union County grand jury returned a twenty-eight-count indictment\\n\\nagainst all defendants. Defendant was charged with twelve counts including\\n\\nfirst-degree racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:41-2(c) and (d) (counts one and three, respectively); first-degree promoting\\n\\norganized street crime, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30(a) (count four); second-degree\\n\\nconspiracy as a leader of organized crime; first-degree conspiracy to commit\\n\\nmurder; third-degree aggravated assault; and numerous drug and weapons\\n\\noffenses.\\n\\n      Count four of the indictment charged defendant with promoting\\n\\norganized street crime by\\n\\n            purposefully conspir[ing] with others as an organizer,\\n            supervisor, manager or financier to commit a\\n            continuing series of crimes which constitute a pattern\\n            of racketeering activity under the provisions of\\n            N.J.S.A. 2C:41-1, contrary to the provisions of N.J.S.A.\\n            2C:33-30.\\n\\n      At trial, the State produced a police officer who testified to seeing a\\n\\nhand-to-hand drug transaction that had been arranged on a phone call police\\n\\nintercepted during their surveillance. The State also presented evidence from\\n\\nthe search of defendant’s home, where an assortment of items commonly\\n\\n\\n                                        4\\n associated with the sale of narcotics was recovered, as well as plastic bags\\n\\ncontaining heroin residue and a plastic bag containing 3.806 grams of cocaine.\\n\\n      The trial court held a jury charge conference on February 25, 2019. The\\n\\ncourt provided the parties with advance copies of the proposed jury\\n\\ninstructions and offered defendant an opportunity to note objections to the jury\\n\\ncharge that had been raised in earlier off-the-record discussions. Relevant to\\n\\nthis matter, defendant objected to the jury instructions concerning count four\\n\\nof the indictment -- first-degree promoting organized street crime. Defendant\\n\\nargued that the language of the indictment departed from the statute and that\\n\\nthe jury charge reflected that error.\\n\\n      The court agreed with defendant’s objection, and the State conceded that\\n\\nthe inclusion of “pattern of racketeering activity” in the indictment was legally\\n\\nincorrect. The court attempted to remove any confusion for the jury and\\n\\ncomply with the statute. It looked elsewhere in the indictment and found that\\n\\nin count three the State alleged three crimes that were examples of a “pattern\\n\\nof racketeering activity”; the court held that those alleged offenses were also\\n\\nsuitable enumerated predicate offenses of promoting pursuant to N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:33-30. Although the charges in count three were referred to as a group, the\\n\\nactual charges that would be listed in the jury charge were not mentioned by\\n\\nname on the record at that time.\\n\\n                                        5\\n Regarding count four, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\\n\\n      The relevant section of our statute reads in pertinent\\n      part . . . that:\\n\\n      A person promotes organized street crime if he\\n      conspires with others as an organizer, supervisor or\\n      manager or financier to commit the certain crimes\\n      including conspiracy to commit murder, aggravated\\n      assault and conspiracy to distribute a controlled\\n      dangerous substance.\\n\\n      In order to convict the defendant of this charge, the\\n      State must prove each of the following elements beyond\\n      a reasonable doubt:\\n\\n         1. That defendant purposely conspired with two or\\n         more persons.\\n\\n         2. That the purpose of the conspiracy was to commit\\n         the crime of conspiracy to commit murder and/or\\n         aggravated assault and/or conspiracy to distribute a\\n         controlled dangerous substance.\\n\\n         3. That within that conspiracy, defendant was\\n         financier, organizer, supervisor or manager.\\n\\n      The first element that the State must prove beyond a\\n      reasonable doubt is that the defendant purposely\\n      conspired with two or more persons.\\n\\n      I previously charged you on conspiracy.\\n\\n      The second element the State must prove beyond a\\n      reasonable doubt is that the purpose of the conspiracy\\n      was to commit the crime of conspiracy to commit\\n      murder and/or aggravated assault and/or conspiracy to\\n      distribute a controlled dangerous substance, which\\n      must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n                                  6\\n             In this case the State alleges that defendant conspired\\n            to commit the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder\\n            and/or aggravated assault and/or conspiracy to\\n            distribute a controlled substance. The State must prove\\n            beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant conspired to\\n            commit one of these crimes. You must unanimously\\n            agree about the crime or crimes defendant conspired to\\n            commit . . . .\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\nIn a previous charge, the court instructed the jury on conspiracy as follows:\\n\\n            A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or\\n            persons to commit a crime if with the purpose of\\n            promoting or facilitating its commission he:\\n\\n               1. Agrees with such other person or persons that\\n               they or one or more of them will engage in conduct\\n               which constitutes such crime or an attempt or\\n               solicitation to commit such crime; or\\n\\n               2. Agrees to aid such other person or persons in the\\n               planning or commission of such crime or of an\\n               attempt or solicitation to commit such crime.\\n\\nThe court also noted that conspiracy “is a crime in itself separate and distinct”\\n\\nfrom the crime that is the object of the conspiracy. That is, “a defendant may\\n\\nbe found guilty of the crime of conspiracy regardless of whether that defendant\\n\\nis guilty or not guilty of the” underlying crime.\\n\\n      The jury returned guilty verdicts on four counts: second-degree\\n\\npromoting, simple assault, and two drug offenses. The jury acquitted\\n\\ndefendant of all other charges. As to the promoting charge, the verdict sheet\\n\\n                                        7\\n instructed the jury that if they found defendant guilty of promoting, they were\\n\\nto continue to decide upon which predicate offense they were basing their\\n\\ndecision. According to the jury verdict sheet, the jury found defendant not\\n\\nguilty of conspiracy to commit murder, not guilty of aggravated assault, but\\n\\nguilty of conspiracy to distribute CDS as a predicate offense of promoting.\\n\\n      At sentencing, defendant moved for a new trial, renewing his challenge\\n\\nto count four of the indictment and the jury charge. Defendant again argued\\n\\nthat it was improper to combine the racketeering statute with the promoting\\n\\nstatute in that count. Defendant contended that the promoting statute\\n\\ncontained specific enumerated predicate crimes, of which N.J.S.A. 2C:41-1\\n\\nwas not one. Defendant also claimed that N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2(g) -- leader of\\n\\norganized crime -- is not part of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30. 1\\n\\n      The trial court denied the motion, relying on its earlier ruling that\\n\\ndefendant was on notice of the three predicate offenses because of their\\n\\ninclusion in other counts of the indictment. The court was satisfied that “the\\n\\njury did find beyond a reasonable doubt the predicate offense” of “conspiracy\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2(g) is a subsection of the conspiracy statute which defines a\\nleader of organized crime as a person who purposefully conspires with others as an\\norganizer, supervisor, manager, or financier to commit a continuing series of\\ncrimes which constitute a pattern of racketeering activity under the provisions of\\nN.J.S. 2C:41-1. Nowhere in this statute is there any reference to N.J.S.A. 2C:33-\\n30.\\n                                          8\\n to distribute CDS, which is consistent with the remainder of the verdict.”\\n\\nFinding no manifest denial of justice, the court denied defendant’s motion and\\n\\nproceeded to sentence him.\\n\\n      Defendant received a six-year term of imprisonment with a three-year\\n\\nperiod of parole ineligibility on count twenty-three (conspiracy to distribute\\n\\nCDS), concurrent to a five-year term of imprisonment on count eleven\\n\\n(possession of CDS), and concurrent to a six-month period of incarceration on\\n\\ncount seven (simple assault). The court also sentenced defendant to ten years’\\n\\nimprisonment with a five-year period of parole ineligibility on count four\\n\\n(promoting), to be served consecutive to counts twenty-three, seven, and\\n\\neleven, resulting in an aggregate sentence of sixteen years’ imprisonment with\\n\\nan eight-year parole disqualifier.\\n\\n      Defendant appealed his conviction of the promoting offense. In an\\n\\nunpublished decision, the Appellate Division agreed that count four was\\n\\nlegally incorrect but concluded, like the trial court, that defendant was on\\n\\nnotice of the other offenses the State alleged elsewhere in the indictment, such\\n\\nas various drug offenses, aggravated assault, and conspiracy to commit\\n\\nmurder. The Appellate Division therefore found defendant was unable to\\n\\ndemonstrate he was prejudiced because he was fully able to provide a defense\\n\\nas to each offense. The Appellate Division affirmed defendant’s conviction of\\n\\n                                        9\\n promoting, ultimately concluding that N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30 specifically prohibits\\n\\n“conspiracy to commit a wide range of chapters and wide range of offenses,\\n\\nincluding conspiracy to distribute CDS.” (emphasis added).\\n\\n      We granted defendant’s petition for certification. 253 N.J. 404 (2023).\\n\\nWe also granted leave to appear as amicus curiae to the Association of\\n\\nCriminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL).\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n      Defendant asks this Court to reverse his conviction of promoting under\\n\\ncount four of the indictment, arguing that conspiracy to distribute CDS is not a\\n\\npredicate offense of promoting, and the trial court should not have instructed\\n\\nthe jury as such. First, defendant contends that conspiracy, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2, is\\n\\nnot listed as a predicate offense in the promoting statute, and that New Jersey\\n\\ncourts have repeatedly found that when a statute enumerates predicate crimes,\\n\\nthat list is deemed to be exclusive. Second, defendant underscores that\\n\\n“promoting” under N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30, is a conspiracy offense itself.\\n\\nDefendant thus reasons that to include a conspiracy offense as a predicate\\n\\noffense to promoting would require the notion of a conspiracy to conspire,\\n\\nwhich is not a recognized offense under New Jersey criminal law.\\n\\n      The ACDL likewise argues that a plain reading of the promoting statute\\n\\nestablishes that conspiracy, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 is not an enumerated\\n\\n                                       10\\n offense and that the Court should reject the “double inchoate crime” of\\n\\nconspiracy to conspire.\\n\\n      The State argues that defendant’s conviction should be affirmed because\\n\\nany error in the jury instruction was incapable of producing an unjust result.\\n\\nConceding that conspiracy to distribute CDS is not a predicate offense under\\n\\nthe promoting statute, the State asserts that any reference to conspiracy was\\n\\nharmless. According to the State, the jury instructions did not expand\\n\\ndefendant’s culpability nor diminish proofs that the State needed to establish\\n\\ndefendant’s guilt. The State thus argues that, even though conspiracy pursuant\\n\\nto N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 is not listed as an enumerated offense in N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30,\\n\\nit is encompassed within the meaning of the statute. The State relies on the\\n\\nAppellate Division’s finding that the promoting statute includes conspiracy to\\n\\ndistribute CDS and thus the trial court properly instructed the jury.\\n\\n      The State contends, in essence, that the conspiracy referenced in the\\n\\npromoting statute is ongoing and continues throughout the underlying offense,\\n\\nsuch that the mention of another conspiracy is superfluous or a “stutter” but\\n\\nnot meaningful. The State also contends that defendant failed to preserve this\\n\\nissue by not fully articulating the argument raised on appeal and that the Court\\n\\nshould review this issue under the plain error standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       11\\n                                        III.\\n\\n      The trial court’s ruling that conspiracy to distribute CDS contrary to\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5 is a predicate offense of promoting\\n\\nunder N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30 is a legal determination that we review de novo,\\n\\nwithout deference to the trial court or Appellate Division’s interpretive legal\\n\\nconclusions. See Fowler v. Akzo Nobel Chems. Inc., 251 N.J. 300, 323\\n\\n(2022); Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, 140 N.J. 366,\\n\\n378 (1995).\\n\\n      In reviewing N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30, we “ascribe[] to the statutory words\\n\\ntheir ordinary meaning and significance and read[] them in context with\\n\\nrelated provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a whole.” W.S. v.\\n\\nHildreth, 252 N.J. 506, 518 (2023) (quoting DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477,\\n\\n492 (2005)). If the language is clear, the Court need not look beyond the text\\n\\nto determine its meaning. Ibid. “Statutes must be read in their entirety,” with\\n\\n“‘each part or section . . . construed in connection with every other part or\\n\\nsection to provide a harmonious whole.’” Id. at 519 (quoting In re Civ.\\n\\nCommitment of W.W., 245 N.J. 438, 449 (2021)). The “[C]ourt may neither\\n\\nrewrite a plainly-written enactment of the Legislature nor presume that the\\n\\nLegislature intended something other than that expressed by way of the plain\\n\\nlanguage.” Ibid. (quoting O’Connell v. State, 171 N.J. 484, 488 (2002)). And\\n\\n                                       12\\n when “the Legislature has carefully employed a term in one place yet excluded\\n\\nit in another, it should not be implied where excluded.” Alan J. Cornblatt,\\n\\nP.A. v. Barow, 153 N.J. 218, 234 (1998).\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      With those principles in mind, we first consider whether the jury charge\\n\\ndeparted impermissibly from the plain language of the promoting statute,\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:33-30(a), which provides as follows:\\n\\n            A person promotes organized street crime if he\\n            conspires with others as an organizer, supervisor,\\n            financier or manager to commit any crime specified in\\n            chapters 11 through 18, 20, 33, 35, or 37 of Title 2C of\\n            the New Jersey Statutes; N.J.S.A. 2C:34-1; N.J.S.A.\\n            2C:39-3; N.J.SA. 2C:39-4; section 1 [N.J.S.A. 2C:39-\\n            4.1]; N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5; or N.J.S.A. 2C:39-9.\\n\\n      The promoting statute sets forth a conspiracy offense. A person may be\\n\\nguilty of the offense only if the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that\\n\\nsuch a person has conspired with others to promote organized street crime, in\\n\\nthe capacity of an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager, with the goal of\\n\\ncommitting any of the specified predicate offenses. Thus, to prove\\n\\n“promoting,” the State must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt the accused\\n\\nconspired to commit at least one offense on the list of predicate offenses. Ibid.\\n\\nThat list includes any offenses from Chapters 11 through 18 of the Criminal\\n\\nCode (homicide, assault, kidnapping, sex offenses, robbery, bias offenses,\\n\\n                                       13\\n arson, burglary); any offenses from Chapters 20 (theft), 33 (riot, disorderly\\n\\nconduct, related offenses), 35 (controlled dangerous substances), and 37\\n\\n(gambling offenses) of the Code; and a specific offense or offenses within\\n\\nChapters 34 (public indecency) and 39 (firearms, other dangerous weapons\\n\\noffenses) of the Code, to the exclusion of the other offenses within Chapters\\n\\n34 and 39.\\n\\n      Conspicuously absent from the list of predicate offenses is the\\n\\nsubstantive offense of conspiracy pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2. The offense of\\n\\nconspiracy is not listed as a predicate offense itself, nor is it specified within\\n\\nany of the enumerated chapters as a predicate offense of the promoting statute.\\n\\nThe jury instruction in this case thus erroneously departed from the list of\\n\\npermissible predicate offenses in N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30(a).\\n\\n      The State argues that the additional “conspiracy” language was merely\\n\\nsuperfluous and did not amplify the meaning of the charge or the jury\\n\\ninstruction -- essentially “a stutter in which the word . . . conspiracy was\\n\\nrepeated twice, rather than once.” Moreover, the State argues, because\\n\\npromoting is a conspiratorial offense any additional mention of conspiracy\\n\\nregarding a predicate simply refers to the ongoing nature of the conspiracy.\\n\\n      That argument fails because the State asks that we presume the jury\\n\\nskipped over or ignored relevant, synonymous words in the jury instruction.\\n\\n                                         14\\n “A charge is a road map to guide the jury, and without an appropriate charge a\\n\\njury can take a wrong turn in its deliberations . . . . [T]he court must explain\\n\\nthe controlling legal principles and the questions the jury is to decide.” Das v.\\n\\nThani, 171 N.J. 518, 527 (2002) (alteration and omission in original) (quoting\\n\\nState v. Martin, 119 N.J. 2, 15 (1990)). One of the foundations of our jury\\n\\nsystem is the presumption that jurors listen to and are guided by the court’s\\n\\ninstructions as they judge the facts of a case to determine guilt. State v. Bey,\\n\\n112 N.J. 45, 82 (1988) (recognizing “the general presumption that jurors act in\\n\\ngood faith and seek to comply with the court’s instructions”). Words that\\n\\ninform a juror’s understanding of the elements of an offense cannot be\\n\\nmeaningless. Here, the court’s words -- that the State must prove “[t]hat the\\n\\npurpose of the conspiracy was to commit the crime of conspiracy to commit\\n\\nmurder and/or aggravated assault and/or conspiracy to distribute a controlled\\n\\ndangerous substance” (emphases added) -- erroneously opened to the jury the\\n\\npossibility of convicting defendant for conspiracy to conspire to distribute\\n\\nCDS, a crime that does not exist because conspiracy to distribute CDS is not a\\n\\npredicate offense under the promoting statute.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      We now must consider the consequences of that error. “The proper\\n\\nstandards of review of jury instructions are well-settled: if the party contesting\\n\\n                                        15\\n the instruction fails to object to it at trial, the standard on appeal is one of plain\\n\\nerror; if the party objects, the review is for harmless error.” Willner v.\\n\\nVertical Reality, Inc., 235 N.J. 65, 80 (2018). To show that an error was not\\n\\nharmless, the proponent of the objection must establish “some degree of\\n\\npossibility that [the error] led to an unjust result.” State v. Baum, 224 N.J.\\n\\n147, 159 (2016) (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Lazo, 209 N.J. 9, 26\\n\\n(2012)). “The possibility must be real, one sufficient to raise a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt as to whether [the error] led the jury to a verdict it otherwise might not\\n\\nhave reached.” Ibid. (quoting Lazo, 209 N.J. at 26).\\n\\n      “[A]ppropriate and proper [jury instructions] are essential for a fair\\n\\ntrial.” Baum, 224 N.J. at 158-59 (quoting State v. Reddish, 181 N.J. 553, 613\\n\\n(2004)); accord State v. Green, 86 N.J. 281, 287 (1981). A trial court has an\\n\\n“independent duty . . . to ensure that the jurors receive accurate instructions on\\n\\nthe law as it pertains to the facts and issues of each case, irrespective of the\\n\\nparticular language suggested by either party.” Reddish, 181 N.J. at 613.\\n\\nIndeed, so critical are these instructions that failures to provide accurate\\n\\ninstructions on material issues “are presumed to be reversible error.” State v.\\n\\nJordan, 147 N.J. 409, 422 (1997); State v. McKinney, 223 N.J. 475, 495 (2015)\\n\\n(“[E]rroneous instructions on material points are presumed to possess the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          16\\n capacity to unfairly prejudice the defendant.” (internal quotation marks\\n\\nomitted) (quoting State v. Bunch, 180 N.J. 534, 541-42 (2004))).\\n\\n      “[C]learly erroneous instructions usually are considered ‘poor candidates\\n\\nfor rehabilitation under the harmless error philosophy.’” State v. Feaster, 156\\n\\nN.J. 1, 45 (1998) (quoting State v. Brown, 138 N.J. 481, 522 (1994)). But a\\n\\nparty who fails to properly object to an infirm jury instruction leaves the court\\n\\nconstrained to review for plain error, whereby even a confirmed error may be\\n\\nreversed only if it is “clearly capable of producing an unjust result.” State v.\\n\\nMontalvo, 229 N.J. 300, 320-21 (2017) (quoting R. 2:10-2).\\n\\n      Preserving an issue for appeal pursuant to Rule 1:7-2 requires that “‘a\\n\\nparty . . . make known to the court specifically the action which the party\\n\\ndesires the court to take or the party’s objection to the action taken and the\\n\\ngrounds therefor.’ Such an objection may be offered ‘in open court, in the\\n\\nabsence of the jury.’” Willner, 235 N.J. at 79 (quoting R. 1:7-2).\\n\\n      Here, the State argues that defendant failed to preserve the challenge to\\n\\ncount four and that the court’s instruction should therefore not be reversed\\n\\nbecause it did not constitute plain error. We consider each argument in turn.\\n\\n                                        1.\\n\\n      In his initial objection at the jury charge conference defendant raised the\\n\\nirregularity in count four where “pattern of racketeering activity” under the\\n\\n                                        17\\n provisions of N.J.S.A. 2C:41-1 was incorrectly listed as a predicate offense for\\n\\na conviction of promoting contrary to N.J.S.A. 2C:33-30. The trial court\\n\\namended the indictment over defendant’s objection, under its authority found\\n\\nin Rule 3:7-4. The court replaced the language “pattern of racketeering\\n\\nactivity” in count four with the substantive charges that were listed in count\\n\\nthree of the indictment as the predicate offenses for “pattern of racketeering\\n\\nactivity” under N.J.S.A. 2C:41-2(d), namely: conspiracy to commit murder,\\n\\naggravated assault, and conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance.\\n\\nEssentially, the court determined that the same offenses that could serve as the\\n\\npredicates to a racketeering charge served as the predicates to a promoting\\n\\ncharge, notwithstanding the separate list of predicate offenses within the\\n\\npromoting charge itself.\\n\\n      During the motion for a new trial argued prior to sentencing, defendant\\n\\nonce again objected to the jury charges and argued that the error began in the\\n\\nindictment, where defendant was “mischarged,” and that defendant was\\n\\nprejudiced when the court amended the indictment. Although an objection\\n\\nalone does not adequately preserve an issue for appeal under Rule 1:7-2,\\n\\ndefendant did more than merely voice a general objection. Defendant clearly\\n\\nraised an objection to the now-challenged jury instruction at various points\\n\\nleading up to, during, and through the end of the trial. Our law does not\\n\\n                                       18\\n require that objections be precisely identical to the issues raised on appeal to\\n\\navoid plain error review. See State v. Ramirez, 462 N.J. Super. 1, 18 (App.\\n\\nDiv. 2019) (finding harmless error applicable because the defendants\\n\\n“repeatedly objected to the charge, albeit not precisely on the grounds . . .\\n\\nenunciated” on appeal), rev’d on other grounds, 246 N.J. 61 (2021).\\n\\n      Based on the objections raised, and defendant’s attempts to alert the\\n\\ncourt regarding the inconsistency between the indictment and the relevant\\n\\nstatute, we hold that the issue was properly preserved. We therefore review\\n\\nthe matter for harmless error.\\n\\n                                         2.\\n\\n      Errors that have the capacity to affect material issues in the “jury’s\\n\\ndeliberation are presumed to be reversible in criminal prosecutions.” Jordan,\\n\\n147 N.J. at 422; State v. Warren, 104 N.J. 571, 579 (1986). We have\\n\\npreviously held that jury instructions in criminal trials are critical, as\\n\\nsomeone’s liberty is at stake. State v. Green, 86 N.J. 281, 289 (1981). An\\n\\nerror cannot be harmless if there is “some degree of possibility that [the error]\\n\\nled to an unjust result.” Lazo, 209 N.J. at 26 (alteration in original) (quoting\\n\\nState v. R.B., 183 N.J. 308, 330 (2005)).\\n\\n      Here, as the jury’s verdict sheet plainly reveals, defendant was convicted\\n\\nand sentenced based upon a charge that does not exist within our criminal\\n\\n                                         19\\n code. Such a result is not harmless, but rather unjust. The jury abided by its\\n\\noath and discharged its responsibility faithfully by finding defendant guilty of\\n\\nconspiring as a financier, organizer, supervisor, or manager, to enter a\\n\\nconspiracy to distribute CDS, based on the jury instructions provided. But,\\n\\nbecause no such crime exists, the jury’s verdict, premised upon the instructions\\n\\nprovided by the trial court, is legally invalid. This, we find, is a manifest\\n\\ninjustice. Defendant’s sentence cannot be based upon a nonexistent crime.\\n\\n                                       IV.\\n\\n      For those reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division.\\n\\nThe jury acquitted defendant of the remaining two predicate offenses. Because\\n\\ndefendant was not on notice of any other proper predicate offense for the\\n\\npromoting statute under count four of the indictment, the jury’s verdict on that\\n\\ncount is vacated without a remand. 2 The Court does not reach the question\\n\\nraised by defendant and amicus ACDL as to whether a double inchoate crime\\n\\nmay exist within New Jersey’s criminal code.\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER APTER, and FASCIALE join in JUSTICE NORIEGA’s\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  According to representations by counsel, defendant has been released from\\nprison. To the extent he may continue to be subject to any restrictions arising\\nfrom his conviction on count four, we vacate those restrictions.\\n                                      20\\n '),\n",

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n                    Christine Savage v. Township of Neptune\\n                                (A-2-23) (087229)\\n\\nArgued January 17, 2024 -- Decided May 7, 2024\\n\\nRABNER, C.J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court considers whether a “non-disparagement provision”\\nin a settlement agreement can stop parties from revealing details relating to claims\\nof discrimination, retaliation, or harassment.\\n\\n       Plaintiff Christine Savage began her career as a police officer with the\\nNeptune Township Police Department in 1998. In December 2013, she filed a\\nlawsuit against the Department, the Township of Neptune, and others for sexual\\nharassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation, contrary to the Law Against\\nDiscrimination (LAD). The parties entered into a settlement agreement in 2014.\\nSavage filed a second action in April 2016 against a number of the same defendants,\\nalleging that they had violated the settlement agreement and engaged in continuing\\n-- and “intensified” -- sex discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\\n\\n       The parties entered into another settlement agreement in July 2020.\\nParagraph 10 of the agreement requires in part that the parties agree not to make or\\ncause others to make any statements “regarding the past behavior of the parties” that\\n“would tend to disparage or impugn the reputation of any party. The parties agree\\nthat this non-disparagement provision extends to statements, written or verbal,\\nincluding but not limited to, the news media, radio, television, . . . government\\noffices or police departments or members of the public.”\\n\\n       A television news show aired a story about the case and an interview with\\nSavage in August 2020. Defendants contend that Savage violated the non-\\ndisparagement provision of the settlement agreement during the interview both\\nthrough comments she made, such as “you abused me for about 8 years,” and\\ncomments by the interviewer, such as “Savage says the harassment and retaliation\\nintensified with bogus disciplinary charges.”\\n\\n        Defendants filed a motion to enforce the second settlement agreement. The\\ntrial court granted the motion, finding that the LAD barred only non-disclosure and\\n                                          1\\n confidentiality agreements and that Savage instead violated a non-disparagement\\nclause. The Appellate Division affirmed in part and reversed in part. 472 N.J.\\nSuper. 291, 314 (App. Div. 2022). Relying on the definitions of non-disclosure and\\nnon-disparagement provisions set forth in Black’s Law Dictionary, the appellate\\ncourt found the parties’ non-disparagement clause enforceable but held that Savage\\nhad not violated it. Ibid. The Court granted certification. 255 N.J. 284 (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Through N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(a), a section of the LAD that was enacted in\\nthe wake of the “#MeToo movement,” the Legislature removed barriers that\\npreviously made it difficult for individuals to report abuse. Survivors of\\ndiscrimination, retaliation, and harassment now have a legal right to tell their story\\n-- a right that cannot be taken away by a settlement agreement. Because the scope of\\nthe agreement in this case would bar individuals from describing an employer’s\\ndiscriminatory conduct, the agreement encompasses speech the LAD protects. The\\nnon-disparagement clause in the agreement is against public policy and cannot be\\nenforced.\\n\\n1. N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(a) provides in part that “[a] provision in any employment\\ncontract or settlement agreement which has the purpose or effect of concealing the\\ndetails relating to a claim of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment (hereinafter\\nreferred to as a “non-disclosure provision”) shall be deemed against public policy\\nand unenforceable against a current or former employee.” The law’s shorthand\\nreference -- the phrase “non-disclosure provision” -- plainly draws its meaning from\\nthe words it refers back to, not from outside sources like Black’s Law Dictionary.\\nWhen the Legislature sets out to define a specific term, as it did here, courts are\\nbound by that definition. As a result, labels like “non-disclosure,” which is in the\\ntext, or “non-disparagement,” which is not, do not control the meaning of section\\n12.8. The operative terms of N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(a) ask whether a provision in an\\nemployment contract or a settlement agreement “has the purpose or effect of\\nconcealing the details relating to a claim of discrimination, retaliation, or\\nharassment.” If it does, the agreement is “against public policy and unenforceable\\neven if the details relating to a claim disparage an employer. (pp. 14-16)\\n\\n2. The law’s structure reinforces the conclusion that it encompasses “non-\\ndisparagement” provisions that would conceal details about discrimination claims.\\nSubsection (c) of N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8 expressly exempts particular types of clauses\\nthat might otherwise be barred by the plain language of (a), and the Legislature\\ncould have exempted non-disparagement agreements as well. But it did not. Certain\\nlanguage in section 12.8 -- the use of “relating to” and “a” in the phrase “relating to\\na claim of discrimination” -- also support a broad reading of the statute. And the\\nCourt explains how the statute’s legislative history, though not needed to understand\\nsection 12.8’s clear language, reinforces the law’s plain meaning. (pp. 16-20)\\n\\n\\n                                          2\\n 3. Paragraph 10 of the settlement agreement uses expansive language that\\nencompasses speech about claims of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment.\\nThe scope of the agreement -- barring all statements that would tend to disparage a\\nperson -- is quite broad. It would prevent employees from revealing information\\nthat lies at the core of what section 12.8 protects -- details about claims of\\ndiscrimination. In that way, the agreement directly conflicts with the LAD. The\\ncarveout at the end of paragraph 10 does not save the agreement. The last sentence\\nstates that “testimony or statements of Plaintiff related to other proceedings\\nincluding lawsuits” is not precluded. Section 12.8’s protections, however, extend\\nbeyond statements made in pleadings or courtrooms. Survivors of discrimination\\nand harassment have the right to speak about their experiences in any number of\\nways, and they can no longer be restrained by confidentiality provisions in\\nemployment contracts or settlement agreements. (pp. 21-22)\\n\\n4. The Court reviews defendants’ specific objections to comments Savage made in a\\ntelevision interview. All of the challenged comments are protected under section\\n12.8, but paragraph 10 of the settlement agreement, if enforced, would have the\\neffect of preventing Savage from making any of them. The non-disparagement\\nclause in the settlement agreement conflicts with the LAD in that it encompasses and\\nwould bar speech the statute protects. It has the effect of concealing details relating\\nto claims of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment, which is directly contrary to\\nthe LAD, and it is therefore against public policy and unenforceable. (pp. 22-25)\\n\\n5. The Court provides guidance for remand and explains that it upholds the\\nAppellate Division’s conclusion that defendants are not entitled to attorney’s fees\\nand costs, albeit for different reasons.

The parties ultimately entered into a settlement agreement that\\n\\nprevented both sides from “mak[ing] any statements . . . regarding the past\\n\\nbehavior of the parties, which . . . would tend to disparage or impugn the\\n\\nreputation of any party.”\\n\\n      Afterward, a television reporter interviewed the sergeant, and she\\n\\ncommented about the matter. Defendants then filed a motion to enforce the\\n\\nsettlement agreement.\\n\\n      We find that the Law Against Discrimination (LAD) protects the\\n\\nsergeant’s statements. In particular, N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(a) (section 12.8),\\n\\n\\n                                        3\\n enacted in 2019 in the wake of the “#MeToo” movement, states that a\\n\\nprovision in a settlement agreement that “has the purpose or effect of\\n\\nconcealing the details relating to a claim of discrimination, retaliation, or\\n\\nharassment . . . shall be deemed against public policy and unenforceable.”\\n\\n      Through those words, the Legislature removed barriers that previously\\n\\nmade it difficult for individuals to report abuse. Survivors of discrimination,\\n\\nretaliation, and harassment now have a legal right to tell their story -- a right\\n\\nthat cannot be taken away from them by a settlement agreement.\\n\\n      Because the scope of the agreement in this case would bar individuals\\n\\nfrom describing an employer’s discriminatory conduct, the agreement\\n\\nencompasses speech the LAD protects. Defendants also used the agreement to\\n\\ntry to hold the sergeant liable for making statements about her claims of\\n\\ndiscrimination, retaliation, and sexual harassment, which section 12.8\\n\\nspecifically protects. For those reasons, the non-disparagement clause in the\\n\\nagreement is against public policy and cannot be enforced. We therefore\\n\\nreverse in part, and affirm in part, the judgment of the Appellate Division.\\n\\n                                         I.\\n\\n      We draw certain background facts from the amended complaint plaintiff\\n\\nfiled in 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         4\\n       Plaintiff Christine Savage began her career as a police officer with the\\n\\nNeptune Township Police Department in 1998. In December 2013, she filed a\\n\\nlawsuit against the Department, the Township of Neptune, and others for\\n\\nsexual harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation, contrary to the LAD.\\n\\nThe parties entered into a settlement agreement in 2014. As part of the\\n\\nsettlement, defendants agreed to promote Savage to the rank of sergeant and\\n\\nprovide her with access to training.\\n\\n      Savage filed a second action in April 2016 against a number of the same\\n\\ndefendants. In an amended complaint, she alleged that defendants violated the\\n\\nsettlement agreement and engaged in continuing -- and “intensified” -- sex\\n\\ndiscrimination, harassment, and retaliation in violation of the LAD, the State\\n\\nCivil Rights Act, and the State Constitution. She asserted that she was\\n\\n“subjected to unfair assessments, arbitrary internal affairs investigations,\\n\\ndiscriminatory work assignments, discriminatory performance standards and\\n\\nevaluations, and more stringent scrutiny, monitoring and oversight.” Among\\n\\nother things, Savage alleged defendants violated department procedures and\\n\\nordinances “to promote males over females”; failed to train and supervise\\n\\n“employees to ensure compliance with . . . anti-harassment and anti-\\n\\nretaliation” policies; and “fostered a discriminatory, harassing and retaliatory\\n\\natmosphere.”\\n\\n                                        5\\n       To settle the second lawsuit, the parties entered into another settlement\\n\\nagreement in July 2020. The second agreement called for plaintiff to remain\\n\\nemployed so that she could reach twenty-five years of pensionable service, and\\n\\nfor her to receive a total of $248,560.70 for pain and suffering, reimbursement\\n\\nfor the purchase of pension credits, and retroactive pay.\\n\\n      Paragraph 10 of the agreement is central to this appeal. It reads in part\\n\\nas follows:\\n\\n              The parties agree not to make any statements written or\\n              verbal, or cause or encourage others to make any\\n              statements, written or verbal regarding the past\\n              behavior of the parties, which statements would tend to\\n              disparage or impugn the reputation of any party. The\\n              parties agree that this non disparagement provision\\n              extends to statements, written or verbal, including but\\n              not limited to, the news media, radio, television, . . .\\n              government offices or police departments or members\\n              of the public.\\n\\n              [(emphasis added).]\\n\\nThe trial court dismissed the case as settled on July 24, 2020.\\n\\n      A television news show, NBC 4 New York, aired a story about the case\\n\\non August 11, 2020. The segment included a recent interview news reporter\\n\\nSarah Wallace conducted with Savage, as well as a short clip from a prior\\n\\ninterview. Defendants contend that Savage violated the non-disparagement\\n\\nprovision of the settlement agreement during the interview.\\n\\n\\n                                         6\\n       The content of the interview appears below. Defendants challenge the\\n\\nunderlined passages; passages in italics are from the earlier interview, which\\n\\npre-dated the settlement agreement.\\n\\n            Reporter (introducing segment): We have an I-Team\\n            exclusive update tonight. A major win for a former\\n            police sergeant who sued Neptune Township in central\\n            New Jersey for sex discrimination. Now a settlement.\\n            Investigative reporter Sarah Wallace has covered the\\n            legal battle for years and joins us now with details of a\\n            closing chapter.\\n\\n            Savage: I feel vindicated.\\n\\n            Wallace: Neptune Township’s only female police\\n            sergeant, Christine Savage, claiming a legal victory.\\n            The 46-year-old agreeing to settle a contentious sexual\\n            discrimination lawsuit which she first filed against her\\n            superiors in 2013.\\n\\n            Savage: My integrity’s intact and I get to keep my rank,\\n            you couldn’t fire me, you couldn’t demote me, you\\n            abused me, you abused me for about 8 years.\\n\\n            Wallace: Savage says the harassment and retaliation\\n            intensified with bogus disciplinary charges.\\n\\n            Savage: I never asked for special treatment, I just asked\\n            for the same treatment.\\n\\n            Wallace: In 2018, she was put on unpaid leave after\\n            being found unfit for duty during a psych exam. The\\n            sergeant claims it was a set up.\\n\\n            Savage: They wouldn’t tell me what it was that\\n            determined me unfit.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         7\\n Wallace: She spoke out then for the first time to the I-\\nTeam.\\n\\nSavage: I’m being financially choked out.\\n\\nWallace: Savage fought back in court. The result, one\\nhearing after another, and a back and forth series of\\nother psych exams.\\n\\nSavage: But I passed 5 fitness for duties, 5, and at no\\npoint in time was I put back to work.\\n\\nWallace: She never got back in uniform, but the\\nTownship finally agreed to put her back on the payroll\\nand then a settlement offer for this veteran who will\\nretire with 25 years on the job, with full benefits, back\\npay and all disciplinary charges dismissed. The\\nTownship denies any improper conduct.\\n\\nWallace: What do you say to other whistleblowers?\\n\\nSavage: Stand your ground. Don’t submit.\\n\\nWallace: I’ve seen the toll it has taken on you over the\\nyears. Was it worth it?\\n\\nSavage: It is worth it. If you have the integrity, and\\nthe strength to stand your ground and stand up for\\nwhat’s right then that’s worth its weight in gold.\\n\\nWallace: But Savage also believes women will\\ncontinue to face an uphill battle for equal promotions\\nwithin her department.\\n\\nSavage: I really don’t think you’re ever going to see\\nanother female sergeant, lieutenant, captain or above.\\n\\nWallace: Because?\\n\\n\\n\\n                           8\\n             Savage: Because we’re oppressed. They don’t want\\n            women there.\\n\\n            Wallace: Has it not changed?\\n\\n            Savage: It has not changed, not for a minute. It’s not\\n            gonna change, it’s the good ol’ boy system.\\n\\n      Several weeks after the interview aired, defendants filed a motion to\\n\\nenforce the second settlement agreement. The trial court granted the motion.\\n\\n      The court found the LAD barred only non-disclosure and confidentiality\\n\\nagreements, and that Savage instead violated a non-disparagement clause,\\n\\nwhich was enforceable. The court ordered Savage to “abide by the non-\\n\\ndisparagement clause” and “directed [her] to refrain from making any further\\n\\nstatements, or conducting any further interviews, which disparage the\\n\\nDefendants in violation of the settlement agreement.” The court denied\\n\\ndefendants’ request for $23,206.38 in damages but awarded defendants\\n\\n$4,917.50 in counsel fees and costs. The trial court denied Savage’s cross-\\n\\nmotion for counsel fees and costs.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division affirmed in part and reversed in part. Savage v.\\n\\nTownship of Neptune, 472 N.J. Super. 291, 314 (App. Div. 2022). It held that\\n\\nthe non-disparagement clause was enforceable but that Savage had not violated\\n\\nit. Ibid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       9\\n       The court’s opinion rested on its interpretation of N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(a),\\n\\nwhich states that a provision in a settlement agreement that “has the purpose or\\n\\neffect of concealing the details relating to a claim of discrimination,\\n\\nretaliation, or harassment (hereinafter referred to as a ‘non-disclosure\\n\\nprovision’) shall be deemed against public policy and unenforceable.” The\\n\\nappellate court observed that the statute’s plain language applies to\\n\\n“nondisclosure provision[s],” but not to “non-disparagement provisions.” Id.\\n\\nat 307. Although the court recognized “there can be some overlap” between\\n\\nthe two, id. at 310, it concluded they were different concepts, id. at 307.\\n\\n      For support, the Appellate Division looked to Black’s Law Dictionary,\\n\\nwhich defined “[a] nondisclosure or confidentiality clause [as] a ‘clause\\n\\nprohibiting the parties to an agreement from disclosing to nonparties the terms\\n\\nof the agreement and, often, anything related to the formation of the\\n\\nagreement.’” Ibid. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 315 (11th ed. 2019)). “In\\n\\ncontrast,” the court observed, “a non-disparagement clause is a ‘contractual\\n\\nprovision prohibiting the parties from publicly communicating anything\\n\\nnegative about each other.’” Ibid. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 315).\\n\\n      The court concluded, in essence, that “[t]he Legislature could have, but\\n\\ndid not, prohibit the enforcement of non-disparagement provisions.” Id. at\\n\\n308. In the appellate court’s view, the legislative history likewise “did not\\n\\n                                        10\\n address non-disparagement provisions.” Id. at 309. As a result, the court\\n\\nfound the non-disparagement provision was enforceable. Id. at 310.\\n\\n      Parsing the statements made in the interview, however, the Appellate\\n\\nDivision held they did not violate the provision. Id. at 314. The court found\\n\\nthat Savage’s comments toward the end of the interview were “about present\\n\\nor future behavior,” not “past behavior,” and that the “plain language of the\\n\\nagreement” barred only the latter. Id. at 313-14.\\n\\n      Accordingly, the Appellate Division vacated the award of counsel fees\\n\\nand costs to defendants and affirmed the trial court’s order denying counsel\\n\\nfees and costs to plaintiff. Id. at 314.\\n\\n      We granted Savage’s petition for certification. 255 N.J. 284 (2023). We\\n\\nalso granted leave to the Attorney General, the New Jersey Association for\\n\\nJustice (NJAJ), the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA), and\\n\\nLibertarians for Transparent Government (LTG) to participate as friends of the\\n\\ncourt. The National Employment Lawyers Association of New Jersey (NELA)\\n\\nfirst appeared before the Appellate Division as an amicus and has remained in\\n\\nthe case. See R. 1:13-9(d).\\n\\n                                           II.\\n\\n      Savage argues that the Appellate Division’s analysis is flawed. She\\n\\nsubmits that by focusing on the label used in the settlement agreement in this\\n\\n                                           11\\n case -- “non-disparagement provision” -- instead of the clause’s purpose and\\n\\neffect, the appellate court mistakenly upheld a provision that will “allow[]\\n\\nemployers to silence victims of discrimination, retaliation or harassment\\n\\nthrough” the use of similar non-disparagement clauses. According to Savage,\\n\\nthat outcome would violate the LAD and the express language in section 12.8.\\n\\n      Defendants ask the Court to uphold the Appellate Division’s ruling.\\n\\nThey contend that section 12.8 does not apply here because it only addresses\\n\\nnon-disclosure provisions and neither addresses nor prohibits non-\\n\\ndisparagement clauses. In addition, defendants maintain that Savage\\n\\n“blatantly ignored the non-disparagement clause during” the interview with\\n\\nNBC News. Defendants also submit that eliminating non-disparagement\\n\\nclauses “would discourage settlement by both employers and employees.”\\n\\n      Amici all support Savage’s position. They argue that the LAD bars any\\n\\nclause in a settlement agreement that has the purpose or effect of concealing\\n\\ndetails relating to claims of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment,\\n\\nregardless of the label attached to the clause. And they contend the non-\\n\\ndisparagement clause in this case has that very purpose and effect.\\n\\n      Amici also point to section 12.8’s legislative history for support. The\\n\\nNJAJ contends the amendment to the LAD was meant “to end provisions in\\n\\nsettlement agreements used to silence and intimidate survivors of sexual\\n\\n                                        12\\n harassment.” If the non-disparagement clause is upheld, the NJEA submits,\\n\\n“employers will simply switch” from “non-disclosure” to “non-disparagement”\\n\\nprovisions to “continue the cycle of buying silence” the Legislature “sought to\\n\\nend.” The Attorney General adds that because the Division on Civil Rights is\\n\\ncharged with enforcing the LAD, its interpretation of the law is entitled to\\n\\ngreat weight.\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      In this case of statutory interpretation, our review is de novo. DeSimone\\n\\nv. Springpoint Senior Living, Inc., 256 N.J. 172, 181 (2024). To interpret the\\n\\nmeaning of a statute, courts seek “to determine and give effect to the\\n\\nLegislature’s intent.” In re Registrant H.D., 241 N.J. 412, 418 (2020) (quoting\\n\\nDYFS v. A.L., 213 N.J. 1, 20 (2013)). The “‘best indicator’ of legislative\\n\\nintent” is typically the plain language of the statute. W.S. v. Hildreth, 252 N.J.\\n\\n506, 518 (2023) (quoting State v. Lane, 251 N.J. 84, 94 (2022)). We also read\\n\\neach part of a statute “in context with related provisions so as to give sense to\\n\\nthe legislation as a whole.” DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005).\\n\\n      If the plain language of a statute is clear, our task is complete. If the text\\n\\nis ambiguous, we can turn to extrinsic evidence including relevant legislative\\n\\nhistory for guidance. Sanjuan v. Sch. Dist. of W. N.Y., 256 N.J. 369, 379\\n\\n                                        13\\n (2024) (citing DiProspero, 183 N.J. at 492-93). But we do not generally\\n\\nconsider proposed legislation that was not enacted to interpret a statute. State\\n\\nv. O’Donnell, 255 N.J. 60, 79 (2023).\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      This case turns on the meaning of a section in New Jersey’s Law Against\\n\\nDiscrimination. The LAD is remedial legislation that must “be liberally\\n\\nconstrued.” N.J.S.A. 10:5-3. Its overarching purpose is to eradicate\\n\\ndiscrimination in society. Nini v. Mercer Cnty. Cmty. Coll., 202 N.J. 98, 115\\n\\n(2010). Among other reasons, it was enacted “to protect the public’s strong\\n\\ninterest in a discrimination-free workplace.” Lehmann v. Toys ‘R’ Us, Inc.,\\n\\n132 N.J. 587, 600 (1993). “Because discrimination is still a pervasive problem\\n\\nin the modern workplace,” arguments “advanced by victims of workplace\\n\\ndiscrimination” require careful attention in order to give effect to the\\n\\nLegislature’s intent. Smith v. Millville Rescue Squad, 225 N.J. 373, 390-91\\n\\n(2016).\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      The proper starting point is the plain language of the statute. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n10:5-12.8(a) provides as follows:\\n\\n            A provision in any employment contract or settlement\\n            agreement which has the purpose or effect of\\n            concealing the details relating to a claim of\\n            discrimination, retaliation, or harassment (hereinafter\\n                                        14\\n             referred to as a “non-disclosure provision”) shall be\\n            deemed against public policy and unenforceable against\\n            a current or former employee (hereinafter referred to as\\n            an “employee”) who is a party to the contract or\\n            settlement. If the employee publicly reveals sufficient\\n            details of the claim so that the employer is reasonably\\n            identifiable, then the non-disclosure provision shall\\n            also be unenforceable against the employer.\\n\\n            [(emphasis added).]\\n\\nSubsection (c) exempts non-competition clauses and agreements not to\\n\\ndisclose trade secrets or proprietary information from the above rule; in\\n\\nother words, those clauses can be included in settlement agreements.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(c).\\n\\n      The text of the statute reveals its meaning and scope. The law’s critical\\n\\nlanguage -- highlighted in the first sentence above -- bars provisions in\\n\\nsettlement agreements that have “the purpose or effect of concealing the\\n\\ndetails relating to a claim of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment.”\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(a). The statute then uses a shorthand reference -- the\\n\\nphrase “non-disclosure provision” -- for that key language. The phrase plainly\\n\\ndraws its meaning from the words it refers back to -- not from outside sources\\n\\nlike Black’s Law Dictionary.\\n\\n      “When the Legislature sets out to define a specific term,” as it did here,\\n\\n“‘courts are bound by that definition.’” State v. S.B., 230 N.J. 62, 68 (2017)\\n\\n(quoting Febbi v. Bd. of Rev., 35 N.J. 601, 606 (1961)); see also Van Buren v.\\n                                        15\\n United States, 593 U.S. 374, 387 (2021) (“When ‘a statute includes an explicit\\n\\ndefinition’ of a term, ‘we must follow that definition, even if it varies from a\\n\\nterm’s ordinary meaning.’” (citation omitted)). As a result, labels like “non-\\n\\ndisclosure,” which is in the text, or “non-disparagement,” which is not, do not\\n\\ncontrol the meaning of section 12.8. Instead, the language the Legislature used\\n\\ntells us what the law means.\\n\\n      Our focus, therefore, belongs on the law’s operative terms, which ask\\n\\nwhether a provision in an employment contract or a settlement agreement “has\\n\\nthe purpose or effect of concealing the details relating to a claim of\\n\\ndiscrimination, retaliation, or harassment.” N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(a). If it does,\\n\\nthe agreement is “against public policy and unenforceable.” Ibid. That is true\\n\\neven if the details relating to a claim disparage an employer.\\n\\n      In theory, parties can agree not to disparage one another by disclosing\\n\\ninformation that has nothing to do with “details relating to . . . claim[s] of\\n\\ndiscrimination, retaliation, or harassment.” See ibid. For example, parties\\n\\ncould agree not to disclose details about their personal lives or matters\\n\\nunrelated to a discrimination claim -- like “my employer drinks heavily at\\n\\nwork” or “cheats on his taxes.” Such an agreement, however, would have to\\n\\nbe narrowly drawn to ensure that details relating to the claims listed in section\\n\\n12.8 could be revealed publicly.\\n\\n                                        16\\n       The law’s structure reinforces the conclusion that it encompasses “non-\\n\\ndisparagement” provisions that would conceal details about discrimination\\n\\nclaims. Subsection (c) of N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8 expressly exempts particular\\n\\ntypes of clauses that might otherwise be barred by the plain language of (a):\\n\\n(1) non-competition provisions, and (2) agreements not to disclose proprietary\\n\\ninformation -- “trade secrets, business plan and customer information.” The\\n\\nLegislature could have exempted non-disparagement agreements as well. But\\n\\nit did not. See S.B., 230 N.J. at 69 (declining to add exemptions the\\n\\nLegislature “decidedly and explicitly . . . chose not to” include in a statute);\\n\\nsee also 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction § 47.11 (7th\\n\\ned. 2014) (“[W]here a general provision in a statute has certain limited\\n\\nexceptions, all doubts should be resolved in favor of the general provision\\n\\nrather than the exceptions.” (quotation omitted)).\\n\\n      Certain language in section 12.8 also supports a broad reading of the\\n\\nstatute. Section 12.8 bars the concealment of details “relating to” a claim of\\n\\ndiscrimination, retaliation, or harassment. Ibid. (emphasis added). “The\\n\\nordinary meaning of [the phrase ‘relating to’] is a broad one -- to stand in some\\n\\nrelation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association\\n\\nwith or connection with.” Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S.\\n\\n374, 383 (1992) (quotation and quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n                                        17\\n       Section 12.8, in addition, protects the disclosure of “details relating to a\\n\\nclaim of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment.” (emphasis added). The\\n\\nword “a” does not distinguish between claims that give rise to a settlement\\n\\nagreement and others that do not. Nor does it distinguish among past, present,\\n\\nor future claims. The statute encompasses them all. See Villa v. Short, 195\\n\\nN.J. 15, 26 (2008) (holding that the phrase “an insured” in an insurance policy\\n\\nrefers to “all insureds”); see also Allstate Ins. Co. v. Stamp, 588 A.2d 363, 365\\n\\n(N.H. 1991) (finding that the “use of the indefinite article ‘an,’ rather than the\\n\\ndefinite ‘the,’ before ‘insured’ is a clear reference to any insured”).\\n\\n      For all of those reasons, we find that the meaning of section 12.8 turns\\n\\non what the law says, not on any labels applied to it, and that the statute has a\\n\\nbroad reach.\\n\\n                                        D.\\n\\n      The statute’s legislative history, though not needed to understand section\\n\\n12.8’s clear language, see DCPP v. D.C.A., 256 N.J. 4, 19 (2023), reinforces\\n\\nthe law’s plain meaning. Section 12.8 was enacted in the wake of the\\n\\n“#MeToo” movement 1 to protect individuals who suffer sexual harassment,\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  “‘MeToo’ was first coined in 2006 . . . as the name for a movement to help\\nvictims of sexual harassment and assault. #MeToo catapulted into the public’s\\nconsciousness in October 2017’ when The New York Times published an\\narticle ‘detailing decades of sexual harassment allegations against the\\n                                        18\\n retaliation, and discrimination from being silenced by settlement agreements\\n\\nand employment contracts.\\n\\n      In describing Senate Bill 121, later codified as N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8, the\\n\\nbill’s principal sponsor, Senator Loretta Weinberg, stated that\\n\\n            [a]n important step in delivering meaningful reform is\\n            the legislation that would make non-disclosure\\n            agreements in cases of sexual assault and sexual\\n            harassment unenforceable against employees who are\\n            survivors. These non-disclosure agreements have been\\n            used to silence and intimidate survivors of sexual\\n            assault and harassment as well as victims of\\n            discrimination and retaliation. Limiting these so-called\\n            confidentiality agreements will help eliminate the\\n            secrecy that too often allows abuses to continue. It\\n            should no longer be appropriate to buy forced silence\\n            that further victimizes assault survivors.\\n\\n            [Savage, 472 N.J.

The clause reads in full as follows:\\n\\n            10. The parties agree not to make any statements\\n            written or verbal, or cause or encourage others to make\\n            any statements, written or verbal regarding the past\\n            behavior of the parties, which statements would tend to\\n            disparage or impugn the reputation of any party. The\\n            parties agree that this non disparagement provision\\n            extends to statements, written or verbal, including but\\n            not limited to, the news media, radio, television,\\n            internet postings of any kind, blogs, social media, (e.g.,\\n            Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or the like), consumer or\\n            trade bureaus, other state, county or local government\\n            offices or police departments or members of the public.\\n            Neptune Township will respond to inquiries from\\n            prospective employers with dates of employment and\\n            positions held. The parties agree that non-\\n            disparagement is a material term of this Agreement and\\n            that in the event of a breach, the non-breaching party\\n            may seek enforcement of the non-disparagement\\n            provision and damages for its breach, and that the filing\\n            of any such action would not be deemed a breach of this\\n            Agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed as\\n            prohibiting or precluding in any way testimony or\\n            statements of Plaintiff related to other proceedings\\n            including lawsuits.\\n\\n            [(emphases added.)]\\n\\n      The scope of the agreement -- barring all statements that would tend to\\n\\ndisparage a person -- is quite broad. To accuse someone of misconduct is to\\n                                       21\\n disparage them. To provide details about allegations of discrimination,\\n\\nretaliation, or sexual harassment by an employer, then, would naturally “tend\\n\\nto disparage or impugn” the employer’s “reputation.” The agreement,\\n\\ntherefore, encompasses and would prevent employees from revealing\\n\\ninformation that lies at the core of what section 12.8 protects -- details about\\n\\nclaims of discrimination. In that way, the agreement directly conflicts with the\\n\\nLAD.\\n\\n       The carveout at the end of paragraph 10 does not save the agreement.\\n\\nThe last sentence of the paragraph states that “testimony or statements of\\n\\nPlaintiff related to other proceedings including lawsuits” is not precluded.\\n\\n(emphasis added). Section 12.8’s protections, however, extend beyond\\n\\nstatements made in pleadings or courtrooms. Survivors of discrimination and\\n\\nharassment have the right to speak about their experiences in any number of\\n\\nways, and they can no longer be restrained by confidentiality provisions in\\n\\nemployment contracts or settlement agreements.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n       Defendants’ specific objections to comments Savage made in a\\n\\ntelevision interview make clear how the settlement agreement in this case runs\\n\\nafoul of the LAD. Defendants also challenge comments the reporter made,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        22\\n presumably relying on language in the settlement agreement that bars Savage\\n\\nfrom “caus[ing] or encourag[ing] others to make” disparaging comments.\\n\\n      Defendants challenge two types of comments that Savage made. Some\\n\\nrelate directly to her discrimination, retaliation, and harassment claims; others\\n\\nrelate more generally or indirectly to those claims. Both are protected.\\n\\nSection 12.8 extends to “details relating to a claim of discrimination,” not just\\n\\ndetails that relate “directly” to such a claim. N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.8(a).\\n\\n      The following comments that defendants challenge relate to Savage’s\\n\\nclaims of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment:\\n\\n      *“[Y]ou abused me, you abused me for about 8 years.”\\n\\n      *“Savage says the harassment and retaliation intensified with bogus\\n\\ndisciplinary charges.”\\n\\n      *“In 2018, she was put on unpaid leave after being found unfit for duty\\n\\nduring a psych exam. The sergeant claims it was a set up.”\\n\\n      *“I’m being financially choked out.” [This statement was made during a\\n\\nprior interview.]\\n\\n      Other comments defendants challenge relate more generally to Savage’s\\n\\nclaims:\\n\\n      *“Savage also believes women will continue to face an uphill battle for\\n\\nequal promotions within her department.”\\n\\n                                       23\\n       *“Because we’re oppressed. They don’t want women there.”\\n\\n      *“It has not changed, not for a minute. It’s not gonna change, it’s the\\n\\ngood ol’ boy system.”\\n\\n      The above statements are all protected under the LAD. Certain\\n\\ncomments relate to allegations in Savage’s complaint. See, e.g., First Am.\\n\\nCompl., ¶¶ 47, 95 (discrimination); ¶¶ 48, 95 (retaliation); ¶¶ 40, 47, 95\\n\\n(harassment). Some statements, in fact, mirror specific allegations in the\\n\\ncomplaint. See, e.g., id. ¶ 57 (asserting the Police Chief stated “‘this is a male\\n\\ndominated field’ and it is ‘not going to change’”); ¶¶ 84, 89, 92 (asserting that\\n\\npromotions were designed to “maintain the ‘old boys’ network’” and that men\\n\\nreceived favored treatment); ¶¶ 130, 132 (placement on unpaid leave).\\n\\nAlthough the comments are therefore protected under section 12.8, paragraph\\n\\n10 of the settlement agreement, if enforced, would have the effect of\\n\\npreventing Savage from making any of them.\\n\\n      We note as well that paragraph 10 barred statements relating only to “the\\n\\npast behavior of the parties.” (emphasis added). Had the settlement agreement\\n\\nsurvived scrutiny, defendants could not have relied on it to challenge\\n\\ncomments about present or future events.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        24\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      We find that the non-disparagement clause conflicts with the LAD in\\n\\nthat it encompasses and would bar speech the statute protects -- “details\\n\\nrelating to a claim of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment.” N.J.S.A.\\n\\n10:5-12.8(a). Defendants also used the settlement agreement to attempt to get\\n\\nmonetary damages from Savage for making statements about claims of\\n\\ndiscrimination, retaliation, and sexual harassment she had already filed. In\\n\\naddition, defendants, in effect, sought to enjoin her from making further\\n\\nstatements about those claims.\\n\\n      The effect of this non-disparagement clause, therefore, is to conceal\\n\\ndetails relating to claims of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment, which\\n\\nis directly contrary to the LAD. See ibid. For those reasons, we hold that the\\n\\nnon-disparagement clause in the settlement agreement is against public policy\\n\\nand unenforceable.\\n\\n      In light of our findings under the LAD, we decline to consider arguments\\n\\nrelated to the National Labor Relations Act or the First Amendment, which\\n\\ncertain amici advance.\\n\\n                                       V.\\n\\n      In sum, we find that paragraph 10 of the settlement agreement is against\\n\\npublic policy and cannot be enforced. To the extent any limitations remain in\\n\\n                                       25\\n place on what Savage may say about her claims of discrimination, retaliation,\\n\\nor harassment, they are lifted.\\n\\n      We also remand the matter to the trial court to allow Savage to apply for\\n\\nreasonable attorney’s fees and costs consistent with N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.9. The\\n\\ntrial court previously denied her application, and the Appellate Division\\n\\naffirmed that order. We uphold the Appellate Division’s conclusion that\\n\\ndefendants are not entitled to attorney’s fees and costs, albeit for different\\n\\nreasons that are outlined above.\\n\\n      The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed in part and affirmed\\n\\nin part, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\\n\\n\\n\\n    JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON, PIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER APTER,\\nFASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER’s opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        26\\n '),\n",

SPARC Group LLC (A-50-22) (087981)\\n\\nArgued November 6, 2023 -- Decided March 25, 2024\\n\\nSOLOMON, J., writing for the Court.\\n\\n        The core issue in this appeal is whether plaintiffs -- a class of shoppers at the\\nretail clothing store Aéropostale -- have sufficiently pled that they sustained an\\nascertainable loss caused by the alleged “illusory discounts” offered by defendant\\nSPARC Group LLC -- the owner and operator of Aéropostale -- to withstand\\ndefendant’s motion to dismiss their claims under the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA),\\nN.J.S.A. 56:8-1 to -227, the Truth in Consumer-Contract, Warranty and Notice Act\\n(TCCWNA), N.J.S.A. 56:12-14 to -18, and various common law contract rights.\\n\\n        Plaintiffs’ allegations include purchasing a sweatshirt for $23.98 that was\\nadvertised as being 60% off an original price of $59.95, and three t-shirts advertised\\nas “Buy 1 Get 2 Free” for $29.95. Plaintiffs claim that the items they purchased are\\nnever offered for purchase at the “original” or reference prices listed on the price\\ntag, thereby rendering the advertised “markdowns” illusory and the reference prices\\nfictitious. Plaintiffs allege that such practices violate the CFA, TCCWNA, and\\nseveral common law contract rights. They seek damages and injunctive relief.\\n\\n       Defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. The trial court granted\\ndefendant’s motion, observing that the CFA “unmistakably makes a claim of\\nascertainable loss a prerequisite for a private cause of action.” The court found that\\nplaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts to establish ascertainable loss -- either an\\n“out-of-pocket” loss or a loss of the “benefit of [their] bargain” -- under the CFA or the\\nviolation of a “clearly established legal right” under TCCWNA.\\n\\n       The Appellate Division reversed. \\n474 N.J. Super. 593\\n, 598 (App. Div. 2023).\\nThe majority found that plaintiffs were denied the benefit of their bargain because\\nthey “received no value for the offered discount.” \\nId. at 601-02\\n. The court further\\nheld that, because plaintiffs had adequately alleged that they suffered an\\nascertainable loss for CFA purposes, they had also sufficiently pled that they were\\n“aggrieved consumers” for purposes of TCCWNA and that their other claims should\\nproceed as well \\nId. at 603-05\\n. The concurrence agreed that plaintiffs’ claims should\\nsurvive but under a theory of out-of-pocket loss. \\nId. at 606-07\\n.\\n                                             1\\n       The Court granted defendant’s petition for certification. \\n254 N.J. 202\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: A plaintiff can establish an ascertainable loss by demonstrating either an\\nout-of-pocket loss or a deprivation of the benefit of one’s bargain. The Court does\\nnot find either type of ascertainable loss applicable here because plaintiffs purchased\\nnon-defective, conforming goods with no objective, measurable disparity between\\nthe product they reasonably thought they were buying and what they ultimately\\nreceived. Plaintiffs’ CFA claim therefore fails, and, absent an ascertainable loss\\npursuant to the CFA, plaintiffs are not “aggrieved consumers” under TCCWNA,\\ncannot show injury or damages under their common law claims, and are without\\nclaims entitling them to equitable relief.\\n\\n1. In addition to proscribing certain commercial practices, the CFA provides a\\nprivate right of action through which individuals who have fallen victim to a\\npractice made unlawful by the statute may seek redress. See N.J.S.A. 56:8-19. To\\nstate a claim under that statute, an individual must plead an unlawful practice, an\\nascertainable loss, and a causal relationship between the two. An asserted\\n“ascertainable loss” must be quantifiable or measurable, not hypothetical or illusory.\\nThe Court reviews examples from case law. (pp. 13-18)\\n\\n2. Here, the Appellate Division correctly found that plaintiffs have adequately pled\\nallegations of deceptive conduct that violates the CFA because the complaint\\nsufficiently asserts that the discounts offered were illusory and defendant utilized a\\nfictitious former price in violation of N.J.S.A. 13:45A-9.6(a) (“Use of a fictitious\\nformer price will be deemed to be a violation of the [CFA].”). The Court does not\\ndisturb that aspect of the Appellate Division’s decision. (pp. 18-19)\\n\\n3. But plaintiffs’ CFA claim nevertheless fails because they have not pled facts\\nsufficient to allege ascertainable loss, whether as a loss of the benefit-of-the-bargain\\nor an out-of-pocket loss. Plaintiffs contend that (1) they would not have purchased\\nthe items but for the use of fictitious former pricing, entitling them to damages equal\\nto the purchase prices; or (2) they did not receive the value of what was promised,\\nentitling them to damages equal to the difference between the fictitious “original\\nprice” and the price they actually paid. But plaintiffs do not claim that they\\nattempted to return the items or that Aéropostale refused to accept such a return.\\nThe facts as pled are thus insufficient to establish an out-of-pocket loss. Plaintiffs\\nalso argue that they suffered an ascertainable loss because they did not receive a\\nhigher-value item for a discounted price, which denied them the benefit of their\\nbargain. But, unlike in past cases in which a defect was alleged, plaintiffs purchased\\nand received clothing that was not defective or damaged or worth less than they\\npaid. Although plaintiffs thought they were receiving clothes that defendant once\\nsold for more money, the goods plaintiffs received are exactly what they knowingly\\npurchased -- functioning and usable pants, sweatshirts, and t-shirts. Indeed,\\n                                           2\\n plaintiffs do not argue that the items were worth less than the amount they paid.\\nPlaintiffs thus fail to state a claim for relief under the CFA. (pp. 19-25)\\n\\n4. To state a TCCWNA claim under the facts presented here, plaintiffs would need\\nto establish four elements: (1) defendant is a seller (2) who, in writing, entered into\\na consumer contract or gave or displayed a consumer warranty, notice, or sign (3)\\ncontaining a provision that violates a consumer’s “clearly established legal right,”\\n(4) and plaintiffs are consumers who were thereby “aggrieved.” See N.J.S.A. 56:12-\\n15. A consumer must have suffered adverse consequences as a result of the\\ndefendant’s regulatory violation” to be “aggrieved” within the meaning of\\nTCCWNA. Here, plaintiffs’ alleged harm is premised on the same allegations as\\ntheir CFA claim -- use of a fictitious former price. Because plaintiffs have not\\nincurred an ascertainable loss due to the violation of the fictitious former pricing\\nregulation, plaintiffs are not monetarily aggrieved for purposes of TCCWNA under\\nthe facts pled and therefore cannot state a claim under TCCWNA. (pp. 25-28)\\n\\n5. The Court explains why plaintiffs’ common law claims for money damages fail.\\nPlaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief under the CFA also fails because a plaintiff\\nmust suffer “an ascertainable loss” to sustain a private cause of action. In effect, the\\nCFA permits only the Attorney General to bring actions for purely injunctive relief.\\nThe Attorney General, who supported plaintiffs in this matter as amicus, may thus\\ndirectly challenge defendant’s conduct as alleged here. (pp. 28-31)\\n\\n      REVERSED. The order dismissing the complaint is REINSTATED.\\n\\n       JUSTICE FASCIALE, dissenting, cites (1) the CFA’s strong remedial\\npurpose to protect consumers, (2) the Legislature’s intent to cement the CFA as one\\nof the strongest consumer protection laws in the nation, (3) case precedents, (4)\\nconsumer behavior research, and (5) the insight provided by the Attorney General\\nappearing as amicus, in expressing the view that plaintiffs here have sufficiently\\npleaded that they suffered an ascertainable loss under a benefit-of-the-bargain theory\\nby showing a loss measurable and quantifiable as the difference between the\\nreference price on the products and the amount they actually purchased the products\\nfor. Justice Fasciale is also of the view that plaintiffs here suffered an out-of-pocket\\nloss that is ascertainable -- i.e., the purchase price of the clothing items -- because\\nthey allege that “they would not have purchased the [clothing] items at the prices\\nthey paid had they known the items had not been regularly offered or sold at the\\nhigher list price” and because no attempt to return the items was necessary.\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON and PIERRE-\\nLOUIS join in JUSTICE SOLOMON’s opinion.

Indeed, the\\n\\nAppellate Division found here -- and defendant SPARC Group LLC does not\\n\\ncontest -- that defendant’s conduct violates the CFA.\\n\\n      However, to state a CFA claim, private plaintiffs -- in contrast to the\\n\\nAttorney General -- must show that they suffered an “ascertainable loss of\\n\\nmoneys or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by\\n\\nanother person of any . . . practice declared unlawful under” the CFA.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 56:8-19; Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, Inc., \\n110 N.J. 464\\n, 473\\n\\n(1988). The core issue before this Court is whether plaintiffs have sufficiently\\n\\npled that they sustained an ascertainable loss -- that is, a “loss that is\\n\\nquantifiable or measurable.” Thiedemann v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, \\n183\\n\\nN.J. 234\\n, 248 (2005).\\n\\n      A plaintiff can establish an ascertainable loss by demonstrating either an\\n\\nout-of-pocket loss or a deprivation of the benefit of one’s bargain. \\nIbid.\\n “Out-\\n\\nof-pocket damages represent the difference between the price paid and the\\n\\n                                          3\\n actual value received,” while “benefit-of-the-bargain principles allow\\n\\n‘recovery for the difference between the price paid and the value of the\\n\\nproperty had the representations been true.’” Finderne Mgmt. Co. v. Barrett,\\n\\n402 N.J. Super. 546\\n, 574 (App. Div. 2008) (quoting Correa v. Maggiore, \\n196\\n\\nN.J. Super. 273\\n, 284 (App. Div. 1984)). The trial court determined that\\n\\nplaintiffs could not show either form of ascertainable loss and dismissed their\\n\\ncomplaint; the Appellate Division reversed, although the appellate court split\\n\\nas to the applicable form of loss.\\n\\n      We do not find either type of ascertainable loss applicable here.\\n\\nPlaintiffs cannot assert a “quantifiable or measurable” loss because they\\n\\npurchased non-defective, conforming goods with no objective, measurable\\n\\ndisparity between the product they reasonably thought they were buying and\\n\\nwhat they ultimately received. Plaintiffs’ CFA claim therefore fails.\\n\\n      Additionally, absent an ascertainable loss pursuant to the CFA, plaintiffs\\n\\nare not “aggrieved consumers” under TCCWNA, cannot show injury or\\n\\ndamages under their common law claims, and are thus without claims entitling\\n\\nthem to equitable relief.\\n\\n      We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and\\n\\nreinstate the trial court’s order dismissing the complaint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        4\\n                                         I.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      In June 2021, plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly\\n\\nsituated, filed a six-count class action complaint against defendant SPARC\\n\\nGroup LLC, owner and operator of Aéropostale. The complaint details that\\n\\nplaintiff Christa Robey purchased a sweatshirt for $23.98 that was advertised\\n\\nas being 60% off an original price of $59.95, and three t-shirts advertised as\\n\\n“Buy 1 Get 2 Free” for $29.95. Plaintiff Maureen Reynolds purchased a pair\\n\\nof pants for $18.25 that were advertised as being 50% off an original price of\\n\\n$36.50. Plaintiffs claim that the items they purchased “on sale” are never\\n\\noffered for purchase at the “original” or reference prices listed on the price tag,\\n\\nthereby rendering the advertised “markdowns” illusory and the reference\\n\\nprices fictitious.\\n\\n      Count One of plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that such false advertisements\\n\\nviolate the CFA because they are an “unconscionable commercial practice”\\n\\nproscribed in N.J.S.A. 56:8-2 and because they contravene certain state and\\n\\nfederal pricing regulations. Plaintiffs seek treble damages, reasonable\\n\\nattorneys’ fees, and filing fees and costs under the CFA. Count Two alleges\\n\\nthat defendant violated TCCWNA by offering illusory discounts via “consumer\\n\\nnotices,” i.e., signs and price tags. Plaintiffs seek statutory damages of $100\\n\\n                                        5\\n per class member, as well as actual damages and attorney’s fees under\\n\\nTCCWNA. Counts Three, Four, and Five allege breaches of contract, the\\n\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and express warranty,\\n\\nrespectively. Finally, plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment and class-wide\\n\\ninjunctive relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:16-\\n\\n50 to -62.\\n\\n       Defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint pursuant to Rule 4:6-\\n\\n2(e). The trial court granted defendant’s motion, observing that the CFA\\n\\n“unmistakably makes a claim of ascertainable loss a prerequisite for a private\\n\\ncause of action.”\\n\\n       The court found plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts to establish\\n\\neither an “out-of-pocket” loss or a loss of the “benefit of [their] bargain.”\\n\\nFirst, the trial court found that there was no out-of-pocket loss given that\\n\\nplaintiffs did not receive “products that were unsuitable for their intended use,\\n\\nor [plead] that they needed to incur extra expenses because of defendant’s\\n\\nalleged misrepresentations.” Second, absent a showing that the goods were\\n\\ndefective, nonconforming, or worth less than what plaintiffs paid, the trial\\n\\ncourt determined the losses were illusory and hypothetical under the benefit-\\n\\nof-the-bargain theory. Thus, the court found no ascertainable loss under the\\n\\nCFA.\\n\\n                                         6\\n       The trial court concluded that, without an ascertainable loss under the\\n\\nCFA, the violations of the CFA alleged cannot form the basis of a violation of\\n\\na “clearly established legal right” under TCCWNA. The court also found that\\n\\nthe federal and state pricing regulations on which plaintiffs rely do not provide\\n\\na private cause of action and therefore could not form the basis of a claim\\n\\nunder TCCWNA. Finally, the court found that plaintiffs had not pled facts\\n\\nsufficient to invoke N.J.A.C. 13:45-9.6, which proscribes the use of “fictitious\\n\\nformer prices” to make an offered price seem more appealing. Finding that\\n\\nplaintiffs had not shown that defendant violated a clearly established legal\\n\\nright, the trial court determined that plaintiffs “received the exact merchandise\\n\\nthat they bargained for at prices they agreed to pay” and were thus not\\n\\n“aggrieved consumers.” Therefore, the trial court found that plaintiffs’\\n\\nTCCWNA claim necessarily failed.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division disagreed and reversed the trial court’s\\n\\njudgment. Robey v. SPARC Grp. LLC, \\n474 N.J. Super. 593\\n, 598 (App. Div.\\n\\n2023).\\n\\n      The Appellate Division held that plaintiffs sufficiently pled an\\n\\nascertainable loss under the CFA, finding that plaintiffs were denied the\\n\\nbenefit of their bargain and suffered a “real and quantifiable” loss -- in the\\n\\n                                        7\\n amount of the supposed markdowns, or “illusory discounts” -- because they\\n\\n“received no value for the offered discount.” \\nId. at 601-02, 606\\n. The court\\n\\nfurther held that, because plaintiffs had adequately alleged that they suffered\\n\\nan ascertainable loss for CFA purposes, they had also sufficiently pled that\\n\\nthey were “aggrieved consumers” for purposes of TCCWNA. \\nId. at 603\\n.\\n\\nNoting that the trial court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ common law claims rested\\n\\non its conclusion that plaintiffs had failed to adequately plead deprivation of\\n\\nthe benefit-of-the-bargain, the Appellate Division reversed as to those counts\\n\\nas well. \\nId. at 603-04\\n. Finally, the appellate court held that it was error to\\n\\ndismiss plaintiffs’ claims for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. \\nId.\\n\\nat 604-05\\n.\\n\\n      Judge Berdote Byrne concurred in the judgment, agreeing that plaintiffs’\\n\\npleadings were adequate but expressed the view that they demonstrated an out-\\n\\nof-pocket loss, not the loss of the benefit of a bargain. \\nId. at 606-07\\n (Berdote\\n\\nByrne, J.S.C. (temporarily assigned), concurring). Judge Berdote Byrne\\n\\nexplained that “plaintiffs suffered an ascertainable loss and monetary damages\\n\\n[insofar as] they would not have purchased the items . . . had they known the\\n\\nitems had not been regularly offered at the higher list price.” \\nId. at 608\\n\\n\\n(omission in original). Thus, in Judge Berdote Byrne’s view, plaintiffs “do not\\n\\nhave the right to receive the difference between their out-of-pocket costs and\\n\\n                                        8\\n the fictitiously advertised price,” which “would put plaintiffs in a significantly\\n\\nbetter economic position than they would have been in this situation,” but\\n\\ninstead have a right to a refund of the purchase prices they paid, which would\\n\\nplace plaintiffs “in the same economic position they were prior to the\\n\\nlitigation.” \\nId. at 608-09\\n.\\n\\n      We granted defendant’s petition for certification. \\n254 N.J. 202\\n (2023).\\n\\nWe also granted leave to participate as amici curiae to the National Retail\\n\\nFederation, the Retail Litigation Center, the Chamber of Commerce of the\\n\\nUnited States, the New Jersey Civil Justice Institute, the Attorney General of\\n\\nNew Jersey, and the New Jersey Association for Justice.\\n\\n                                        II.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Before us, defendant argues that consumers do not suffer an\\n\\nascertainable loss when they receive a non-defective and as-advertised product\\n\\nat the agreed-upon price and do not allege that the products purchased are\\n\\nsubstantively different or worth less than what they believed they purchased.\\n\\nDefendant maintains that plaintiffs did not suffer a loss under the benefit-of-\\n\\nthe-bargain theory of damages because they received the exact items that they\\n\\nsought to buy at the prices they sought to pay. Similarly, defendant contends\\n\\nthat plaintiffs’ out-of-pocket theory of loss fails because the items are not\\n\\n                                        9\\n worthless and because plaintiffs do not allege that they paid more than the\\n\\ngoods are worth. Thus, defendant argues that plaintiffs’ CFA claims must fail\\n\\neven though defendant does not challenge the Appellate Division’s\\n\\ndetermination that the pricing practices at issue violate the CFA.\\n\\n      Defendant likewise argues that, because plaintiffs have not shown that\\n\\nthey suffered an ascertainable loss under the CFA, plaintiffs are necessarily not\\n\\n“aggrieved consumers” under TCCWNA. Defendant further maintains that\\n\\nplaintiffs’ common law contract claims must fail because they did not suffer\\n\\nany loss. Lastly, defendant contends that, without a viable claim for damages,\\n\\nplaintiffs have no basis for relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act.\\n\\n      The National Retail Federation and the Retail Litigation Center jointly\\n\\nrepresent that many courts in other jurisdictions have held that the loss of a\\n\\ndiscount is not an ascertainable loss if the goods were conforming and worth\\n\\ntheir advertised value. The Chamber of Commerce and the New Jersey Civil\\n\\nJustice Institute claim that defendant’s conduct did not violate the fictitious\\n\\nformer pricing regulation, N.J.A.C. 13:45A-9.6(a).\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs urge the Court to uphold the Appellate Division’s\\n\\ndetermination that they have stated viable claims under the CFA -- and thus, by\\n\\nextension, under TCCWNA and the common law. As to ascertainable loss,\\n\\n                                        10\\n plaintiffs claim that (1) the average consumer reasonably interprets prices to\\n\\nrepresent the quality and value of goods sold; (2) the goods they purchased\\n\\nwere never sold at the reference prices indicated; (3) they purchased the goods\\n\\nin reliance on misrepresentations; and (4) the true objective quality, value, and\\n\\nworth of the goods purchased is less than what the reference prices\\n\\nrepresented.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs claim that they have adequately pled benefit-of-the-bargain\\n\\ndamages by declaring that the goods purchased lacked the objective value and\\n\\nquality the reference prices represented; they seek damages measured by the\\n\\ndifference between the purchase prices and the reference prices. Additionally,\\n\\nplaintiffs assert that they have sufficiently pled out-of-pocket losses by stating\\n\\nthat defendant’s misrepresentations induced them to make purchases they\\n\\nwould not have made and to pay more for the goods than they otherwise would\\n\\nhave had they known the goods’ true value.\\n\\n      The Attorney General primarily argues that plaintiffs suffered benefit-of-\\n\\nthe-bargain damages and should be allowed to seek injunctive relief on behalf\\n\\nof other consumers.\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n      We are mindful that this matter is before us on a Rule 4:6-2(e) motion to\\n\\ndismiss for failure to state a claim, which requires us to review de novo “the\\n\\n                                        11\\n legal sufficiency of the facts alleged on the face of the complaint.” Baskin v.\\n\\nP.C. Richard & Son, LLC, \\n246 N.J. 157\\n, 171 (2021) (quoting\\n\\nDimitrakopoulous v. Borrus, Goldin, Foley, Vignuolo, Hyman & Stahl, P.C.,\\n\\n237 N.J. 91\\n, 107 (2019)). The test for determining the adequacy of a pleading\\n\\nis “whether a cause of action is ‘suggested’ by the facts,” giving the pleader\\n\\nthe benefit of every reasonable inference. Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp\\n\\nElecs. Corp., \\n116 N.J. 739\\n, 746 (1989) (quoting Velantzas v. Colgate-\\n\\nPalmolive Co., \\n109 N.J. 189\\n, 192 (1988)). In doing so, we must search the\\n\\ncomplaint “thoroughly ‘and with liberality to ascertain whether the fundament\\n\\nof a cause of action may be gleaned even from an obscure statement of claim,\\n\\nopportunity being given to amend if necessary.’” Baskin, 246 N.J. at 171\\n\\n(quoting Printing Mart, \\n116 N.J. at 746\\n).\\n\\n      CFA claims (and TCCWNA claims premised upon CFA claims) are\\n\\n“essentially . . . fraud claim[s],” Hoffman v. Hampshire Labs, Inc., \\n405 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 105\\n, 112 (App. Div. 2009), and are accordingly subject to the\\n\\nheightened pleading standard in Rule 4:5-8(a), which requires that the\\n\\n“particulars of the wrong . . . shall be stated insofar as practicable.” With\\n\\nthose standards in mind, we turn first to plaintiffs’ CFA claims.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        12\\n                                        IV.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Enacted in 1960, L. 1960, c. 39, the CFA provides for relief to\\n\\nconsumers who have been harmed by fraudulent practices in the marketplace\\n\\nby making the use of those practices “unlawful,” Furst v. Einstein Moomjy,\\n\\nInc., \\n182 N.J. 1\\n, 11 (2004). To that end, the CFA broadly prohibits the use of\\n\\n“unconscionable or abusive” commercial practices, as well as “deception,\\n\\nfraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing\\n\\nconcealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that\\n\\nothers rely” thereon. N.J.S.A. 56:8-2. We have interpreted the CFA to protect\\n\\nagainst three forms of unlawful practices: “knowing misrepresentations,\\n\\nomissions of material fact, and violations of administrative regulations.”\\n\\nFurst, \\n182 N.J. at 11\\n. Relevant here, the “[u]se of a fictitious former price”\\n\\nviolates N.J.A.C. 13:45A-9.6(a), a regulation promulgated under the CFA, and\\n\\nis therefore made unlawful by the statute.\\n\\n      In addition to proscribing certain commercial practices, the CFA\\n\\nprovides a private right of action through which individuals who have fallen\\n\\nvictim to a practice made unlawful by the statute may seek redress:\\n\\n            Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of\\n            moneys or property, real or personal, as a result of the\\n            use or employment by another person of any method,\\n            act or practice declared unlawful under this act . . . may\\n                                       13\\n             bring an action . . . . In any action under this section\\n            the court shall, in addition to any other appropriate\\n            legal or equitable relief, award threefold the damages\\n            sustained by any person in interest.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 56:8-19.]\\n\\n      To state a claim under the CFA, an individual must plead an unlawful\\n\\npractice, an ascertainable loss, and a causal relationship between the two.\\n\\nBosland v. Warnock Dodge, Inc., \\n197 N.J. 543\\n, 557 (2009) (citing Int’l Union\\n\\nof Operating Eng’rs Local No. 68 Welfare Fund v. Merck & Co., Inc., \\n192 N.J.\\n\\n372\\n, 389 (2007)).\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 56:8-19 specifically refers to an “ascertainable loss of moneys\\n\\nor property, real or personal.” In construing the meaning of “ascertainable\\n\\nloss,” we have held that the loss must be “‘quantifiable or measurable,’ not\\n\\n‘hypothetical or illusory.’” D’Agostino v. Maldonado, \\n216 N.J. 168\\n, 185\\n\\n(2013) (quoting Thiedemann, \\n183 N.J. at 248\\n). In other words, private\\n\\nplaintiffs need to “demonstrate a cognizable and calculable claim of loss due to\\n\\nthe alleged CFA violation.” Thiedemann, \\n183 N.J. at 249\\n. As we explained in\\n\\nThiedemann, “an ‘estimate of damages, calculated within a reasonable degree\\n\\nof certainty’ will suffice to demonstrate an ascertainable loss.” \\nIbid.\\n (quoting\\n\\nCox v. Sears Roebuck & Co., \\n138 N.J. 2\\n, 22 (1994)).\\n\\n      In CFA cases alleging fraud, misrepresentation, or deception in selling or\\n\\nadvertising, demonstrating “either out-of-pocket loss or . . . loss in value will\\n                                        14\\n suffice to meet the ascertainable loss hurdle and will set the stage for\\n\\nestablishing the measure of damages.” Id. at 248. As we noted in D’Agostino,\\n\\nascertainable loss and damages are separate concepts. 216 N.J. at 192 (“There\\n\\nis no calculation of ‘damages sustained’ unless the ascertainable loss\\n\\nrequirement is first satisfied.”).\\n\\n      A consumer suffers an immediate, out-of-pocket loss or expense when an\\n\\nitem purchased is essentially unusable for its intended purpose or causes\\n\\nbuyers to incur additional costs. For example, in Lee v. Carter-Reed Co., LLC,\\n\\nthe consumer plaintiffs were misled into purchasing diet pills based on the\\n\\nseller’s representations of their effectiveness; the pills did not work. \\n203 N.J.\\n\\n496\\n, 510-11 (2010). We held that, subject to proving the drugs’ defects at trial,\\n\\nthe plaintiffs pled an out-of-pocket ascertainable loss of the full purchase price\\n\\nof each bottle because the goods were allegedly “worthless” for their\\n\\nadvertised purpose. \\nId. at 527-28\\n. Lee applied the principle that the entire\\n\\npurchase price of an item is recoverable as an out-of-pocket loss when a seller\\n\\nmisrepresents the item’s essential qualities and the item received is ultimately\\n\\nworthless for its intended purpose. \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      Conversely, in Thiedemann, we held that customers whose vehicles were\\n\\nrepaired under warranty, at no cost to the customers, did not sustain an out-of-\\n\\npocket loss because there was no difference between the purchase price and the\\n\\n                                        15\\n value received after the cars were repaired. \\n183 N.J. at 251-53\\n. Also\\n\\nillustrative is Meshinsky, in which we held that a prospective buyer did not\\n\\nsuffer an out-of-pocket loss caused by a seller’s forgery of the buyer’s\\n\\nsignature on a loan application because the buyer never made a payment on the\\n\\ntransaction and the seller eventually repaid the bank. \\n110 N.J. at\\n475 n.4.\\n\\n      When a consumer claims that there is a difference in value between an\\n\\nitem as advertised and the item as delivered, but the item is not worthless, the\\n\\nbenefit-of-the-bargain theory of damages is applicable. Mladenov v. Wegmans\\n\\nFood Mkts., Inc., \\n124 F. Supp. 3d 360\\n, 375 (D.N.J. 2015) (“A benefit-of-the-\\n\\nbargain theory requires that the consumer be misled into buying a product that\\n\\nis ultimately worth less than the product that was promised.”). That is, a\\n\\nconsumer suffers a benefit-of-the-bargain loss when the consumer receives less\\n\\nthan what was bargained for.\\n\\n      For example, in Thiedemann, the plaintiffs purchased Mercedes-Benz\\n\\nvehicles sold with defective fuel gauges. \\n183 N.J. at 240\\n. The company\\n\\nrepaired the defect for free under warranty, but the plaintiffs sued and alleged\\n\\nthat receipt of the defective vehicle violated the CFA and deprived them of the\\n\\nbenefit of their bargain, i.e., a non-defective vehicle. \\nId. at 243, 250\\n. We\\n\\ndisagreed and granted summary judgment in favor of Mercedes-Benz. \\nId. at\\n\\n255\\n. Stressing that “[t]he ascertainable loss requirement operates as an\\n\\n                                       16\\n integral check upon the balance struck by the CFA between the consuming\\n\\npublic and sellers of goods,” we reasoned that the bargain between the parties\\n\\nin that case anticipated and provided for the possibility of defects by including\\n\\nfree warranty service to ensure that the vehicles remained fully operable. \\nId.\\n\\nat 251\\n. Because Mercedes-Benz cured the defect pursuant to the bargained-for\\n\\nwarranty, the consumers were not deprived of an operable vehicle. \\nIbid.\\n We\\n\\nrejected, and deemed “too speculative,” the plaintiffs’ argument that there is a\\n\\nfuture hypothetical diminution in the vehicle’s value because it once needed a\\n\\nfuel gauge replaced. \\nId. at 252\\n.\\n\\n      The court in Smajlaj v. Campbell Soup Co. also focused on what the\\n\\nconsumer received in a transaction to determine whether it was objectively less\\n\\nthan what the consumer bargained for. \\n782 F. Supp. 2d 84\\n, 99 (D.N.J. 2011).\\n\\nThere, the plaintiffs suffered a benefit-of-the-bargain loss when they purchased\\n\\ncanned soup that was falsely advertised as having “25% less sodium” than\\n\\nregular soup but did not actually contain less sodium. \\nIbid.\\n That was\\n\\nsufficient to establish a benefit-of-the-bargain loss because the plaintiffs did\\n\\nnot receive what was promised, i.e., reduced-sodium soup. \\nIbid.\\n Thus, in both\\n\\nThiedemann and Smajlaj, the courts compared what consumers actually\\n\\nreceived to what they could objectively expect to receive, based on their\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        17\\n bargain, to determine whether the allegations were sufficient to show an\\n\\n“ascertainable loss.”\\n\\n      The dissent cites dicta in Smajlaj to support its erroneous contention that\\n\\nan illusory loss may constitute ascertainable damages under the CFA. Post at\\n\\n___ (slip op. at 18 ). There was no such illusory loss in Smajlaj; there, the\\n\\nplaintiffs did not receive the product that they bargained for -- soup containing\\n\\nthe promised “25% less sodium.” 782 F. Supp. 2d at 99.\\n\\n      Similarly, the dissent mistakenly cites to Bosland, post at ___ (slip op. at\\n\\n16), in support of its contention that plaintiffs’ loss was not illusory. In\\n\\nBosland, the purchaser of a motor vehicle was charged a $117 nonitemized\\n\\nservice fee that included an undisclosed document service fee, in violation of\\n\\nthe CFA and TCCWNA. \\n197 N.J. at 548\\n. The issue before the Court\\n\\nconcerned whether a demand for refund of the overcharge was required as a\\n\\nprerequisite to establishing an ascertainable loss; it was not. \\nId. at 561\\n. The\\n\\namount of the loss was easily quantifiable -- the amount of the overcharge.\\n\\n      Notwithstanding the liberality of the construction afforded the CFA,\\n\\nascertainable means ascertainable -- “quantifiable or measurable,” D’Agostino,\\n\\n216 N.J. at 185 (quoting Thiedemann, \\n183 N.J. at 248\\n) -- and illusory means\\n\\nillusory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        18\\n                                          B.\\n\\n      Here, plaintiffs’ CFA claim fails because they cannot show either a loss\\n\\nof the benefit-of-the-bargain or an out-of-pocket loss.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division correctly found that plaintiffs have adequately\\n\\npled allegations of deceptive conduct that violates the CFA because the\\n\\ncomplaint sufficiently asserts that the discounts offered were illusory and\\n\\ndefendant utilized a fictitious former price. Robey, 474 N.J. Super. at 600.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that defendant never offered the\\n\\nitems purchased at their “reference price,” thereby rendering the “reference\\n\\nprice” fictitious. Defendant does not contest the Appellate Division’s holding\\n\\nthat plaintiffs adequately pled that defendant utilized a fictitious former price\\n\\nin violation of N.J.S.A. 13:45A-9.6(a), and we do not disturb that aspect of the\\n\\nAppellate Division’s decision. See N.J.S.A. 13:45A-9.6(a) (“Use of a\\n\\nfictitious former price will be deemed to be a violation of the [CFA].”). But\\n\\nplaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to allege an ascertainable loss. 1\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Because we agree with the Appellate Division that the disputed pricing practice\\nviolates a regulation promulgated under the CFA, N.J.A.C. 13:45A-9.6(a), we need\\nnot reach the question whether plaintiffs have adequately pled violations of the\\nadditional state and federal regulations they cite, but do not explain, in support of\\ntheir claims for relief under the CFA and TCCWNA. Those claims cannot succeed\\nbecause plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled ascertainable loss or that they are\\naggrieved consumers, as the CFA and TCCWNA respectively require.\\nFurthermore, the federal regulations cited are guidelines -- “administrative\\n\\n                                         19\\n       Plaintiffs’ pricing claims are inherently different from CFA claims we\\n\\nhave considered in the past. See, e.g., Cox, \\n138 N.J. at 2\\n (near-worthless\\n\\nrepair work performed without necessary permits); Furst, \\n182 N.J. at 1\\n\\n\\n(delivery of defective and non-conforming goods). Here, plaintiffs do not\\n\\nallege that they purchased defective or deficient goods, or that the items they\\n\\nreceived are worthless or even worth less than the price paid. Indeed,\\n\\nplaintiffs do not dispute that the items they bought are precisely what they\\n\\nintended to purchase. Rather, plaintiffs contend that (1) they would not have\\n\\npurchased the items but for the use of fictitious former pricing, entitling them\\n\\nto damages equal to the purchase prices; or (2) they did not receive the value\\n\\nof what was promised, entitling them to damages equal to the difference\\n\\nbetween the fictitious “original price” and the price they actually paid.\\n\\n      Based on our review of the record, we are satisfied, as was the trial\\n\\ncourt, that plaintiffs did not plead sufficient facts to establish an ascertainable\\n\\nloss under either theory. Nowhere in the complaint do plaintiffs allege facts\\n\\nsupporting an out-of-pocket loss, i.e., that the products they purchased were\\n\\nworthless or unsuitable for their intended use, or that they have spent or will\\n\\nspend additional funds following their purchases to make the items usable for\\n\\n\\ninterpretations of law administered by the Commission for the guidance of the\\npublic.” The corresponding federal statutory provisions, \\n15 U.S.C. §§ 45\\n and 46,\\ndo not provide any private right of action.\\n                                         20\\n their intended purpose. See Lee, \\n203 N.J. at 528\\n (finding that the plaintiffs\\n\\nsuffered an out-of-pocket loss each time a class member purchased a dietary\\n\\nsupplement pill that did not provide the benefits represented -- reduction of\\n\\nbelly fat -- and was therefore worthless); Cox, \\n138 N.J. at 22\\n (finding that the\\n\\nplaintiff suffered an ascertainable loss when an employee of the defendant\\n\\nperformed hazardous and shoddy work on the plaintiff’s kitchen, requiring the\\n\\nplaintiff to incur the cost of repairing the work).\\n\\n      Instead, plaintiffs allege that they suffered an out-of-pocket loss of the\\n\\npurchase price because they either would not have bought the items at the\\n\\nprices that they ultimately paid, or they would not have purchased the goods at\\n\\nall but for defendant’s misleading and deceptive advertising. Although\\n\\nplaintiffs allege that they never would have purchased the items, plaintiffs do\\n\\nnot claim that they attempted to return the items or that Aéropostale refused to\\n\\naccept such a return. The facts as pled are thus insufficient to establish an out-\\n\\nof-pocket loss. Accordingly, plaintiffs are not entitled to receive a refund of\\n\\nthe purchase prices.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs also argue that they suffered an ascertainable loss because they\\n\\ndid not receive a higher-value item for a discounted price, which denied them\\n\\nthe benefit of their bargain. Put another way, plaintiffs allege that they did not\\n\\nreceive the savings that defendant advertised. But plaintiffs do not allege that\\n\\n                                        21\\n the items purchased were materially different from what was promised --\\n\\nwearable pants, t-shirts, and a sweatshirt, as advertised. Nor have they alleged\\n\\nany dissatisfaction with or defects in the items purchased. To support their\\n\\nclaim of a loss of the benefit of the bargain, plaintiffs rely principally on Furst.\\n\\nThe Attorney General would also have us decide this issue on Furst principles.\\n\\nBut Furst is inapposite for several reasons.\\n\\n      In Furst, the plaintiff buyer purchased a five-thousand-dollar Ireloom\\n\\ncarpet from a retailer at a discounted price, and the retailer delivered a\\n\\ndamaged and smaller-than-advertised carpet. \\n182 N.J. at 8-9\\n. The defendant\\n\\noffered the plaintiff a refund of the sale price or a similar carpet at an\\n\\nadditional cost but refused to replace the carpet with a conforming one at the\\n\\nsale price the plaintiff paid. \\nId. at 9\\n. The plaintiff sued, and the defendant did\\n\\nnot contest the trial court’s finding that its conduct violated the CFA. \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\nThe issue on appeal was how to calculate damages after the showing of an\\n\\nascertainable loss had already been made. \\nId. at 9-10\\n. In other words, Furst\\n\\nconcerned the damages recoverable for an ascertainable loss, not whether the\\n\\nplaintiffs suffered a loss in the first place, as is the case here. Ibid.; see\\n\\nD’Agostino, 216 N.J. at 192 (explaining that loss and damages “have separate\\n\\nfunctions in the analysis”).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         22\\n       We agreed with the trial court and the Appellate Division that “when a\\n\\nmerchant violates the [CFA] by delivering defective goods and then refusing to\\n\\nprovide conforming goods, a customer’s ascertainable loss is the replacement\\n\\nvalue of those goods.” Furst, \\n182 N.J. at 10\\n. In coming to that conclusion, we\\n\\nconsidered what measure of damages would make the consumer whole -- the\\n\\ncarpet’s replacement value (or fair market value), or the discounted purchase\\n\\nprice? We held that “[t]he merchant who promises to deliver a product at a\\n\\nparticular price must, at the option of the consumer, either deliver the product\\n\\nor render its replacement value.” \\nId. at 14\\n.\\n\\n      In contrast, plaintiffs here are not entitled to benefit-of-the-bargain\\n\\ndamages because they suffered no loss -- they purchased and received clothing\\n\\nthat was not defective or damaged or worth less than they paid. D’Agostino,\\n\\n216 N.J. at 192 (“There is no calculation of ‘damages sustained’ unless the\\n\\nascertainable loss requirement is first satisfied.”) (quoting Thiedemann, \\n183\\n\\nN.J. at 247\\n). Furst would be instructive here if the items plaintiffs purchased\\n\\nturned out to be non-conforming or materially different from what they\\n\\nthought they were purchasing. However, plaintiffs have not made those\\n\\nallegations. Although plaintiffs thought they were receiving clothes that\\n\\ndefendant once sold for more money, the goods plaintiffs received are exactly\\n\\nwhat they knowingly purchased -- functioning and usable pants, sweatshirts,\\n\\n                                        23\\n and t-shirts. Indeed, plaintiffs do not argue that the items were worth less than\\n\\nthe amount they paid; they do not contend, for example, that the $23.98\\n\\nsweatshirt was not worth $23.98 or that the $18.25 pants were not worth\\n\\n$18.25. There is thus no reason to calculate damages under Furst’s benefit of\\n\\nthe bargain principles.\\n\\n      Like the plaintiffs in Thiedemann, whose loss -- a subjective allegation\\n\\nof their vehicle’s diminished value -- was not “ascertainable” within the\\n\\nmeaning of the CFA, plaintiffs here objectively received what they paid for.\\n\\nAccordingly, we find that plaintiffs’ allegations, assumed to be true, do not\\n\\nestablish a cognizable ascertainable loss under a benefit-of-the-bargain theory.\\n\\nThis holding is consistent with the majority of decisions by other state and\\n\\nfederal courts that have addressed whether plaintiffs suffered a cognizable\\n\\ninjury as a result of deceptive pricing under various state consumer protection\\n\\nlaws. See, e.g., Leigh-Pink v. Rio Props., LLC, \\n512 P.3d 322\\n, 327 (Nev. 2022)\\n\\n(“Where a plaintiff received the value of their purchase, we conclude that they\\n\\ncannot demonstrate that they did not receive the benefit of their bargain or\\n\\nshow any out-of-pocket losses, because the value of the goods or services they\\n\\nreceived is equal to the value that they paid.”); Shaulis v. Nordstrom Inc., \\n865\\n\\nF.3d 1\\n, 12 (1st Cir. 2017) (finding plaintiffs suffered no loss where the\\n\\n“product itself was [not] deficient in some objectively identifiable way”);\\n\\n                                       24\\n Gerboc v. Context Logic, Inc., \\n867 F.3d 675\\n, 681 (6th Cir. 2017) (holding that\\n\\nplaintiff had no “actual damages” under Ohio law because “[plaintiff] got what\\n\\nhe paid for: a $27 item that was offered as a $27 item and that works like a\\n\\n$27 item”); Kim v. Carter’s Inc., \\n598 F.3d 362\\n, 364 (7th Cir. 2010) (finding the\\n\\nplaintiffs “got the benefit of their bargain and suffered no harm” under Illinois\\n\\nlaw when “they agreed to pay a certain price for Carter’s clothing, which they\\n\\ndo not allege was defective or worth less than what they actually paid”);\\n\\nHennessey v. Gap, Inc., \\n86 F.4th 823\\n, 828 (8th Cir. 2023) (“[I[n cases where\\n\\nplaintiff was fraudulently induced to purchase a product that was no different\\n\\nin quality than defendant represented at the time of sale, . . . there is no\\n\\nascertainable loss under [Missouri law] because the price paid was both the\\n\\nrepresented value and the value of the product plaintiff received.”).\\n\\n      Having determined that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for relief\\n\\nunder the CFA, we turn to their TCCWNA claim.\\n\\n                                         V.\\n\\n      The Legislature enacted TCCWNA in 1981, L. 1981, c. 454, “to prevent\\n\\ndeceptive practices in consumer contracts,” Dugan v. TGI Fridays, Inc., \\n231\\n\\nN.J. 24\\n, 67 (2017). By passing TCCWNA, the Legislature did not create new\\n\\nlegal rights but sought to require sellers to acknowledge already existing\\n\\n“clearly established consumer rights” by providing new remedies for violations\\n\\n                                         25\\n of those rights. See Spade v. Select Comfort Corp., \\n232 N.J. 504\\n, 515-16\\n\\n(2018); see also Governor’s Statement on Signing A. 1660 (Jan. 11, 1982)\\n\\n(noting that TCCWNA would “strengthen[ ] provisions of the [CFA]”). The\\n\\nrights and responsibilities enforceable by TCCWNA are, therefore, drawn from\\n\\nand established by other legislation. Shelton v. Restaurant.com, \\n214 N.J. 419\\n,\\n\\n432 (2013).\\n\\n      TCCWNA prohibits sellers from engaging in conduct proscribed\\n\\nelsewhere:\\n\\n              No seller, lessor, creditor, lender or bailee shall in the\\n              course of his business offer to any consumer or\\n              prospective consumer or enter into any written\\n              consumer contract or give or display any written\\n              consumer warranty, notice or sign . . . which includes\\n              any provision that violates any clearly established legal\\n              right of a consumer or responsibility of a seller . . . as\\n              established by State or Federal law at the time the offer\\n              is made or the consumer contract is signed or the\\n              warranty, notice or sign is given or displayed.\\n\\n              [N.J.S.A. 56:12-15.]\\n\\nIt further provides a cause of action through which consumers aggrieved by\\n\\nmeans of a proscribed practice may seek recovery: “Any person who violates\\n\\nthe provisions of this act shall be liable to the aggrieved consumer for a civil\\n\\npenalty of not less than $100.00 or for actual damages, or both at the election\\n\\nof the consumer, together with reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs.”\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 56:12-17 (emphasis added).\\n                                         26\\n       Thus, to state a TCCWNA claim under the facts presented here,\\n\\nplaintiffs would need to establish four elements: (1) defendant is a seller (2)\\n\\nwho, in writing, entered into a consumer contract or gave or displayed a\\n\\nconsumer warranty, notice, or sign (3) containing a provision that violates a\\n\\nconsumer’s “clearly established legal right,” (4) and plaintiffs are consumers\\n\\nwho were thereby “aggrieved.” See Pisack v. B & C Towing, Inc., \\n240 N.J.\\n\\n360\\n, 379 (2020); N.J.S.A. 56:12-15, -17.\\n\\n      We clarified in Spade that a consumer must have “suffered adverse\\n\\nconsequences as a result of the defendant’s regulatory violation” to be\\n\\n“aggrieved” within the meaning of TCCWNA. \\n232 N.J. at 523-24\\n. “In the\\n\\nabsence of evidence that the consumer suffered adverse consequences as a\\n\\nresult of defendant’s regulatory violation, a consumer is not an ‘aggrieved\\n\\nconsumer’ for purposes of” the statute. \\nId. at 524\\n.\\n\\n      Here, plaintiffs’ alleged harm is premised on the same allegations as\\n\\ntheir CFA claim -- use of a fictitious former price. Because we determine that\\n\\nplaintiffs have not incurred an ascertainable loss of money or property due to\\n\\nthe violation of the fictitious former pricing regulation, N.J.A.C. 13:45A-\\n\\n9.6(a), plaintiffs are not monetarily aggrieved for purposes of TCCWNA under\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       27\\n the facts pled. 2 The monetary loss analysis does not yield a different result in\\n\\nthis context, and plaintiffs do not allege non-monetary harm. See \\nid., at 523\\n\\n\\n(explaining that a consumer may suffer non-monetary harm if, for example,\\n\\n“untimely delivery and misleading ‘no refunds’ language leaves [the]\\n\\nconsumer without furniture needed for a family gathering”). Accordingly, we\\n\\ndetermine that plaintiffs are not aggrieved consumers and therefore cannot\\n\\nstate a claim under TCCWNA.\\n\\n                                       VI.\\n\\n      We briefly address plaintiffs’ common law claims. First, to state a claim\\n\\nfor breach of contract, a plaintiff must assert that a defendant’s alleged breach\\n\\n“caused a loss to the plaintiffs.” Goldfarb v. Solimine, \\n245 N.J. 326\\n, 338\\n\\n(2021) (quoting Globe Motor Co. v. Igdalev, \\n225 N.J. 469\\n, 482 (2016)).\\n\\nBecause plaintiffs here have not alleged an ascertainable loss for the reasons\\n\\ndiscussed above, their contract claim fails.\\n\\n      Second, to breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, a\\n\\ndefendant must have “engaged in some conduct that denied the benefit of the\\n\\nbargain originally intended by the parties.’” Brunswick Hills Racquet Club,\\n\\nInc. v. Route 18 Shopping Ctr. Assocs., \\n182 N.J. 210\\n, 225 (2005) (emphasis\\n\\n\\n2\\n   We reject the invitation by the parties to opine on whether ascertainable loss\\nis coextensive with the “aggrieved consumer” requirement under TCCWNA,\\nnon-monetary or otherwise.\\n                                         28\\n added). Again, because plaintiffs received the benefit of their bargain and did\\n\\nnot suffer an ascertainable loss, plaintiffs’ claim for breach of the implied\\n\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing fails.\\n\\n      Finally, to state a claim for breach of express warranty, a plaintiff must\\n\\nestablish “the failure of the goods to perform as warranted.” Ford Motor\\n\\nCredit Co., LLC v. Mendola, \\n427 N.J. Super. 226\\n, 242 (App. Div. 2012)\\n\\n(quoting Spring Motors Distribs., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., \\n98 N.J. 555\\n, 586\\n\\n(1985)); see Furst, \\n182 N.J. at 13\\n (explaining that damages for breach of an\\n\\nexpress warranty is “the remedy for a buyer who has accepted defective\\n\\ngoods”). Because the items accepted by plaintiffs were not defective or non-\\n\\nconforming, there is no breach of express warranty.\\n\\n                                       VII.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief. To explain why that relief is\\n\\nunavailable -- even though the pricing practices challenged are indeed\\n\\nunlawful under the CFA -- we briefly review the history of the statute.\\n\\n      In its original form, the Legislature vested only the Attorney General\\n\\nwith enforcement power under the CFA. See Weinberg v. Sprint Corp., \\n173\\n\\nN.J. 233\\n, 248 (2002) (discussing the broad investigative and enforcement\\n\\npowers the Legislature afforded to the Attorney General to accomplish the\\n\\nobjectives of the CFA). In 1971, however, the Legislature amended the CFA to\\n\\n                                        29\\n allow private actions by injured consumers. L. 1971, c. 247, § 7 (codified at\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 56:8-19).\\n\\n      The addition of a private right of action, as we explained in Weinberg,\\n\\nmakes it easier to compensate victims for their actual loss, \\n173 N.J. at 249\\n, and\\n\\nthe treble damages provision punishes the wrongdoer and creates an incentive\\n\\nfor attorneys to take cases involving less substantial losses. \\nIbid.\\n As noted\\n\\npreviously, however, unlike the Attorney General, a plaintiff must suffer “an\\n\\nascertainable loss,” caused by the unlawful conduct, to sustain a private cause\\n\\nof action under the CFA. N.J.S.A. 56:8-19.\\n\\n      That rule applies both to claims and to requests for injunctive relief\\n\\nunder the CFA. See Laufer v. U.S. Life Ins. Co., \\n385 N.J. Super. 172\\n, 185\\n\\n(App. Div. 2006) (“Once this threshold standing requirement” -- i.e., pleading\\n\\nascertainable loss -- “is satisfied, the plaintiff can pursue ‘all available\\n\\nremedies, including an injunction, . . . even if the plaintiff ultimately loses on\\n\\nhis damage claim but does prove an unlawful practice under the Act.’”)\\n\\n(quoting Weinberg, \\n173 N.J. at 253\\n)). Therefore, although plaintiffs and their\\n\\namici are technically correct that the CFA relaxes traditional standards for\\n\\ninjunctive relief, their ability to act as “private attorneys general,” Lemelledo\\n\\nv. Beneficial Mgmt. Corp. of Am., \\n150 N.J. 255\\n, 268 (1997), is reliant on their\\n\\nability to plead an ascertainable loss, see Weinberg, \\n173 N.J. at 250\\n (“The\\n\\n                                         30\\n express language of the statute requires a private party to have a claim that he\\n\\nor she has suffered an ascertainable loss of money or property in order to bring\\n\\na cause of action under the Act. In effect, the Act permits only the Attorney\\n\\nGeneral to bring actions for purely injunctive relief.”). Because plaintiffs here\\n\\ncannot plead ascertainable loss, they cannot seek an injunction for themselves,\\n\\nor others similarly situated under the CFA.\\n\\n      We emphasize that the Attorney General, who supported plaintiffs in this\\n\\nmatter as amicus, does not need to establish an ascertainable loss to bring an\\n\\nenforcement action to enjoin conduct violative of the CFA and may challenge\\n\\ndefendant’s conduct as alleged here. Indeed, the dissent makes a strong case\\n\\nfor why the Attorney General should choose to exercise his power and\\n\\nauthority to seek a court order prohibiting businesses from employing illusory\\n\\ndiscounts and fictitious former prices.\\n\\n                                      VIII.\\n\\n      For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the Appellate Division’s\\n\\njudgment, and reinstate the trial court’s order dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint.\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON and PIERRE-\\nLOUIS join in JUSTICE SOLOMON’s opinion. JUSTICE FASCIALE filed a\\ndissent in which JUSTICES WAINER APTER and NORIEGA join.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          31\\n                           Christa Robey and Maureen\\n                            Reynolds, on behalf of\\n                           themselves and all others\\n                               similarly situated,\\n\\n                            Plaintiffs-Respondents,\\n\\n                                       v.\\n\\n                              SPARC Group LLC,\\n\\n                             Defendant-Appellant.\\n\\n\\n                       JUSTICE FASCIALE, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n      Imagine going to the mall to buy a coat. You enter your first store, and\\n\\nyou find one you like. The price tag says, “70 percent off, originally sold for\\n\\n$1,000.” What do you do? You stop shopping and buy the coat. The store\\n\\npresented you with a great deal: pay $300 for a coat worth $1,000. You not\\n\\nonly like the coat, but you reasonably believe that the store promised you $700\\n\\nin savings. You later learn that the store tricked you into buying the coat by\\n\\nmisrepresenting its value as $1,000. The fact is that the store never sold the\\n\\ncoat for $1,000; they had only sold it for $300. You did not receive the benefit\\n\\nof what you bargained for, nor did you receive what you were promised.\\n\\nMoreover, but for the fake discount, you would not have purchased the coat.\\n\\nTherefore, you suffered a quantifiable and measurable (not merely illusory)\\n ascertainable loss under a benefit-of-the-bargain theory and, arguably, also\\n\\nunder an out-of-pocket loss theory.\\n\\n      That hypothetical is not a fanciful story -- plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded\\n\\nalmost identical allegations. The only differences are the clothing items and\\n\\nthe amounts paid. Here, the class action complaint should never have been\\n\\ndismissed under Rule 4:6-2(e) for failure to plead ascertainable loss.\\n\\nRespectfully, not only does the majority’s decision fail to uphold important\\n\\nand long-standing remedial principles that have guided New Jersey Consumer\\n\\nFraud Act (CFA) cases for decades, but it also does not adequately consider\\n\\nthe precepts we outlined in Furst v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., \\n182 N.J. 1\\n (2004),\\n\\nacknowledge substantial consumer behavior research, or give sufficient weight\\n\\nto the Attorney General’s support for plaintiffs’ position. Plaintiffs’\\n\\nallegations in their 60-page complaint more than sufficiently demonstrate\\n\\nascertainable loss. And consequently, plaintiffs should have the opportunity to\\n\\nmove past the pleading stage and attempt to prove their CFA allegations, along\\n\\nwith their other claims. 1\\n\\n      Thus, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  As the appellate court found, because plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded\\nascertainable loss under a benefit-of-the-bargain theory, their remaining claims\\nshould be reinstated as well.\\n                                        2\\n                                         I.\\n\\n      When reviewing an order dismissing a complaint for failure to state a\\n\\nclaim under Rule 4:6-2(e), we must search “the complaint in depth and with\\n\\nliberality to ascertain whether the fundament of a cause of action may be\\n\\ngleaned even from an obscure statement of claim.” Green v. Morgan Props.,\\n\\n215 N.J. 431\\n, 452 (2013) (emphases added) (quoting Printing Mart-\\n\\nMorristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., \\n116 N.J. 739\\n, 746 (1989)). At the early\\n\\npleadings stage in the litigation, we must accept as true the facts as pleaded in\\n\\nthe complaint. Smith v. SBC Commc’ns, Inc., \\n178 N.J. 265\\n, 268-69 (2004).\\n\\nWe need not be “concerned with the ability of plaintiffs to prove their\\n\\nallegation[s].” Printing Mart, \\n116 N.J. at 746\\n (highlighting that for the\\n\\npurposes of a Rule 4:6-2(e) analysis, “plaintiffs are entitled to every\\n\\nreasonable inference of fact”).\\n\\n      Even applying Rule 4:5-8(a)’s requirement that a heightened pleading\\n\\nstandard is required on dismissal motions when allegations of fraud exist, the\\n\\nallegations in plaintiffs’ lengthy and detailed complaint easily satisfy our\\n\\nheightened pleading rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        3\\n                                        II.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs Christa Robey and Maureen Reynolds filed a class action\\n\\nlawsuit against defendant, SPARC Group LLC, alleging a long-standing\\n\\ndeceptive pricing scheme perpetrated by Aéropostale -- a retail store that\\n\\ndefendant owns and operates. Plaintiffs pleaded in multiple counts various\\n\\ncauses of action including, as pertinent here, that defendant violated the CFA\\n\\nby engaging in affirmative acts (unconscionable commercial practices,\\n\\ndeceptive advertising, and misrepresentations) and by violating N.J.A.C.\\n\\n13:45A-9.6, which provides that “[u]se of a fictitious former price will be\\n\\ndeemed to be a violation of the [CFA].” Plaintiffs Robey and Reynolds further\\n\\nalleged as to their CFA claim that they suffered ascertainable loss because they\\n\\ndid not receive “the claimed value of [their] purchase[s]” and that they would\\n\\nnot have purchased the items but for the intentionally advertised illusory\\n\\ndiscounts.\\n\\n      Thus, we are reviewing an order under Rule 4:6-2(e) that dismissed CFA\\n\\nallegations.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      When reviewing CFA claims, our Court has repeatedly stressed the\\n\\nCFA’s broad remedial purpose and the Legislature’s manifest intent in\\n\\n                                       4\\n enacting the CFA to protect consumers from fraudulent commercial practices\\n\\nin the marketplace. See Thiedemann v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, \\n183 N.J.\\n\\n234\\n, 245 (2005) (“The Legislature enacted the CFA in 1960 to address rampant\\n\\nconsumer complaints about fraudulent practices in the marketplace and to\\n\\ndeter such conduct by merchants.”); All the Way Towing, LLC v. Bucks Cnty.\\n\\nInt’l, Inc., \\n236 N.J. 431\\n, 434 (2019) (noting that the CFA “is a powerful\\n\\n‘legislative broadside against unsavory commercial practices’ in the\\n\\nmarketplace” (quoting Real v. Radir Wheels, Inc., \\n198 N.J. 511\\n, 514 (2009))).\\n\\n      With the CFA’s purpose in mind, “[c]ourts have emphasized that like\\n\\nmost remedial legislation, the [CFA] should be construed liberally in favor of\\n\\nconsumers.” Cox v. Sears Roebuck & Co., \\n138 N.J. 2\\n, 15 (1994) (emphasis\\n\\nadded); DeSimone v.

Failure to faithfully apply the CFA’s\\n\\nundisputed remedial purpose harms consumers.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      Importantly, plaintiffs are pursuing their claims as private parties under\\n\\nthe CFA. The CFA “initially conferred enforcement power exclusively on the\\n\\n                                         5\\n Attorney General,” Thiedemann, \\n183 N.J. at 245\\n, but as part of an amendment\\n\\nin 1971, the CFA “authoriz[ed] a private right of action” -- “arguably the\\n\\ngreatest expansion of the CFA,” DeSimone, ___ N.J. at ___ (slip op. at 12).\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 56:8-19 authorizes this private right of action and provides that\\n\\nif a party were to succeed in showing “any ascertainable loss of moneys or\\n\\nproperty, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another\\n\\nperson of any method, act, or practice declared unlawful under this act,” then a\\n\\n“court shall, in addition to any other appropriate legal or equitable relief,\\n\\naward threefold the damages sustained by any person in interest . . . [and] also\\n\\naward reasonable attorneys’ fees, filing fees and reasonable costs of suit.”\\n\\n      The private right of action under the CFA cannot be underappreciated or\\n\\nmisunderstood. As this Court expressly stated in Bosland v. Warnock Dodge,\\n\\nInc., the legislative history reveals that the enactment of the private right of\\n\\naction was intended to make the CFA “one of the strongest consumer\\n\\nprotection laws in the nation.” \\n197 N.J. 543\\n, 555 (2009) (emphasis added)\\n\\n(quoting Governor’s Press Release for A. 2402, at 1 (Apr. 19, 1971)). It also\\n\\nwas intended to “provide easier access to the courts for the consumer.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n(quoting Governor’s Press Release for A. 2402, at 2 (June 29, 1971)). We\\n\\nhave explicitly recognized that “[t]he private right of action is integral to\\n\\nfulfilling the [CFA’s] legislative purposes, and by allowing recovery of\\n\\n                                         6\\n attorneys’ fees and costs, private attorneys are incentivized to bring CFA\\n\\nclaims, thereby reducing the enforcement burdens that otherwise would fall on\\n\\nthe State.” Sun Chem. Corp. v. Fike Corp., \\n243 N.J. 319\\n, 330 (2020) (second\\n\\nalteration in original) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, the\\n\\nprivate cause of action “greatly reduce[s]” “[t]he primary risk of\\n\\nunderenforcement” of the CFA, Lemelledo v. Beneficial Management Corp. of\\n\\nAmerica, \\n150 N.J. 255\\n, 269-70 (1997), and “the burdens on the Division of\\n\\nConsumer Affairs,” Cox, \\n138 N.J. at 15\\n (quoting Governor’s Press Release for\\n\\nA. 2402, at 2 (June 29, 1971)).\\n\\n      Further, the award of attorneys’ fees outlined in N.J.S.A. 56:8-19 was to\\n\\nencourage and provide an “incentive for members of the bar to become\\n\\n‘private attorneys general’ . . . to enlarge fraud-fighting authority.” Perez v.\\n\\nProfessionally Green, LLC, \\n215 N.J. 388\\n, 402 (2013) (omission in original)\\n\\n(quoting Gonzalez v. Wilshire Credit Corp., \\n207 N.J. 557\\n, 585 (2011)). And\\n\\nimportantly, the remedies outlined in N.J.S.A. 56:8-19 are “not only to make\\n\\nwhole the victim’s loss, but also to punish the wrongdoer and to deter others\\n\\nfrom engaging in similar fraudulent practices.” Furst, \\n182 N.J. at 12\\n.\\n\\n      This case is particularly illustrative of why the Legislature allowed for\\n\\nprivate causes of action under the CFA. The Attorney General, an\\n\\nunquestionably integral part of the CFA’s enforcement, appeared as amicus\\n\\n                                        7\\n curiae in support of plaintiffs’ position and advocated at oral argument that\\n\\nthere are simply too many fictitious pricing violations in the marketplace for\\n\\nthe Attorney General to be able to prosecute them all. Therefore, without\\n\\nprivate parties like plaintiffs bringing actions against wrongdoers engaging in\\n\\nfictitious pricing schemes, the Attorney General will continue to be burdened,\\n\\nwrongdoers will not be deterred, and these unlawful practices will continue to\\n\\nrun rampant in the marketplace, just as studies have reported. Those avoidable\\n\\npitfalls contravene the CFA’s remedial purposes. And as an essential part to\\n\\nthe enforcement of the CFA, the Attorney General’s position on this issue is\\n\\nprofoundly significant, a sentiment the majority fails to meaningfully\\n\\nconsider. 2\\n\\n                                        D.\\n\\n      Unlike enforcement actions brought by the Attorney General, which do\\n\\nnot require a demonstration that the challenged practices caused ascertainable\\n\\nloss to a consumer, it is well-settled that a party pursuing a private cause of\\n\\naction under N.J.S.A. 56:8-19 must demonstrate “(1) an unlawful practice, (2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  Clearly the Attorney General has authority to pursue fictitious pricing\\nviolations in the marketplace without any showing of ascertainable loss. We\\nunderstand his participation in this case as amicus to underscore how seriously\\nthe Attorney General takes the enforcement of laws prohibiting fictitious\\npricing schemes.\\n                                         8\\n an ‘ascertainable loss,’ and (3) ‘a causal relationship between the unlawful\\n\\nconduct and the ascertainable loss.’” Lee v. Carter-Reed Co., L.L.C., \\n203 N.J.\\n\\n496\\n, 521 (2010) (quoting Bosland, \\n197 N.J. at 557\\n). And importantly, “[i]n\\n\\nconsidering these requirements, we have been careful to interpret the CFA, and\\n\\nits prima facie proof requirements, so as to be faithful to the [CFA]’s broad\\n\\nremedial purposes.” Bosland, \\n197 N.J. at 555\\n (emphasis added); see also\\n\\nThiedemann, \\n183 N.J. at 247\\n (noting -- unlike what occurred here -- that “the\\n\\nprima facie proofs necessary for a private cause of action under the CFA must\\n\\nbe applied compatibly with the CFA’s remedial nature”).\\n\\n        That brings me to the important matter at hand. With the above long-\\n\\nstanding legal principles in mind -- standards that were generally reiterated in\\n\\nthe allegations of the complaint 3 -- plaintiffs successfully pleaded the required\\n\\nelements of a private CFA claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n    For example, plaintiffs’ complaint states:\\n\\n              179. The [CFA] is a remedial statute which the New\\n              Jersey Supreme Court has repeatedly held must be\\n              construed liberally in favor of the consumer to\\n              accomplish its deterrent and protective purposes. . . .\\n\\n              ....\\n\\n              201. As with other terms of the [CFA], the term\\n              “ascertainable loss” is to be construed liberally in favor\\n                                           9\\n                                        III.\\n\\n      First, as the majority holds, plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded “an unlawful\\n\\npractice.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 19). It is well-settled that unlawful\\n\\npractices under the CFA “fall into three general categories: affirmative acts,\\n\\nknowing omissions, and regulation violations.” Cox, \\n138 N.J. at 17\\n. The\\n\\nDivision of Consumer Affairs regulations expressly provide that “[u]se of a\\n\\nfictitious former price will be deemed to be a violation of the [CFA].”\\n\\nN.J.A.C. 13:45A-9.6(a). A “fictitious former price” is defined as “an\\n\\nartificially inflated price for an item or items of merchandise established for\\n\\nthe purpose of enabling the advertiser to subsequently offer the item or items\\n\\nat a large reduction.” N.J.A.C. 13:45A-9.1.\\n\\n      Accepting the allegations in the complaint as true, Robey and Reynolds\\n\\nbought products on sale with the expectations of obtaining promised bargains,\\n\\nbut those expectations were never realized. For instance, during one shopping\\n\\ntrip to Aéropostale, Robey viewed a sign that falsely advertised a “hoodie” as\\n\\non sale for 60 percent off of $59.95, the reference price. Relying on these\\n\\nadvertised misrepresentations, Robey purchased the “hoodie” at a price of\\n\\n$23.98. Based on the store’s purposely misleading sale advertisements and\\n\\n\\n\\n            of the consumer in order to carry out the [CFA]’s broad\\n            remedial purposes . . . .\\n                                       10\\n reference prices, Robey reasonably believed she was purchasing a “hoodie”\\n\\nthat was “worth and had the value of $59.95,” but at a bargain of $23.98,\\n\\ntherefore saving $35.97. Similarly, Reynolds went to Aéropostale and viewed\\n\\na sign that deceptively advertised pants for 50 percent off, but with an untrue\\n\\nreference price of $36.50. Once again, relying on these misrepresentations,\\n\\nReynolds purchased the pants for $18.25, believing she obtained a discount of\\n\\n$18.25 and that the pants were valued at $36.50.\\n\\n      What Robey, Reynolds, and other Aéropostale consumers did not know\\n\\nat the time of their purchase was that, as alleged in the complaint, Aéropostale\\n\\nwas actively deceiving its consumers about its advertised discounts. After a\\n\\nsix-year investigation conducted by plaintiffs’ counsel, plaintiffs alleged that\\n\\nthe discounts Aéropostale advertised were “always false” and “illusory,” and\\n\\nthe list or reference prices provided on the clothing’s price tags were “false\\n\\nand inflated.” Plaintiffs alleged with specificity -- notably, enough to satisfy\\n\\nthe heightened pleading standard for fraud cases -- how their investigation\\n\\nrevealed that “for most of the products that A[é]ropostale advertise[d] with a\\n\\ndiscount or with a ‘free’ offer, A[é]ropostale ha[d] never -- not even for a\\n\\nsingle day -- offered the product at the list price in its stores without a discount\\n\\nor ‘free’ offer.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        11\\n       I agree with the majority that the Appellate Division correctly found that\\n\\nplaintiffs adequately pleaded -- in my view, well beyond adequately pleaded --\\n\\nallegations of unconscionable deceptive conduct that violates the CFA. Ante\\n\\nat ___ (slip op. at 19). But it is imperative that I highlight a point the majority\\n\\nhas not mentioned: the widespread problem of fictitious pricing in the\\n\\nmarketplace nationwide.\\n\\n      According to a recently published research article, “the practice of\\n\\nfictitious pricing within the United States has not gone away but instead ‘has\\n\\nproliferated,’ is ‘prevalent,’ and is ‘pervasive,’” which the authors of the\\n\\narticle note is evident by the fact that there are “dozens of lawsuits” in state\\n\\nand district courts attempting to combat the practice. Richard Staelin, Joel E.\\n\\nUrbany & Donald Ngwe, Competition and the Regulation of Fictitious Pricing,\\n\\n87 J. of Mktg. 826, 827 (2023) (citations omitted). News outlets have recently\\n\\nreported on fictitious pricing schemes among major companies as well,\\n\\nshowing the issue is widespread. See Jaclyn Peiser, A Common, Illegal Tactic\\n\\nRetailers Use to Lure Customers, Wash. Post (Nov. 21, 2023),\\n\\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/21/fake-sale-deceptive-\\n\\npricing/ (discussing how many retailers engage in fictitious pricing and why\\n\\nconsumers “fall” for it); Patrick Coffee, Thought You Saved $60 on that\\n\\nVacuum Cleaner?

Plaintiffs alleged that they received neither the discounts nor the\\n\\nrepresented value of the items they were promised or expected. And\\n\\nimportantly, plaintiffs did not make those allegations summarily. Plaintiffs\\n\\nalleged with specificity that:\\n\\n                                       13\\n              92. . . . customers suffered an ascertainable loss and\\n             monetary damages because they did not enjoy the\\n             actual discounts A[é]ropostale represented and\\n             promised to them.\\n\\n             93. . . . customers suffered an ascertainable loss and\\n             monetary damages because the items they purchased\\n             were not in fact worth the inflated amount that\\n             A[é]ropostale represented to them. In fact, the items\\n             did not normally sell for, and were not actually worth,\\n             the fictitious and invented list price that Aéropostale\\n             printed on its price tags and on its website.\\n\\nPlaintiffs also alleged that they “failed to receive the full benefit of the\\n\\npurported discounts offered by [d]efendant” and “did not receive the claimed\\n\\nvalue of [their] purchase, but rather received items worth far less than the\\n\\nvalue claimed by [d]efendant.” (emphasis added). Moreover, plaintiffs\\n\\nalleged that they suffered an ascertainable loss because plaintiffs “would not\\n\\nhave made any purchases from [d]efendant’s A[é]ropostale stores at all but for\\n\\nthe false promises by [d]efendant that [p]laintiffs were receiving merchandise\\n\\nat a significant discount.” As made clear by plaintiffs on appeal, those claims,\\n\\nin essence, allege two theories of ascertainable loss: benefit-of-the-bargain\\n\\ntheory and out-of-pocket loss theory.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs reinforced those allegations by referencing academic research\\n\\nand studies to support their contentions -- research the majority fails to\\n\\nmention. This body of research helps remove any suggestion that plaintiffs’\\n\\n\\n                                         14\\n ascertainable loss is somehow not “quantifiable or measurable,” or that it is\\n\\nsomehow “hypothetical or illusory.” Plaintiffs specifically alleged that:\\n\\n            32. Decades of academic research [have] established\\n            that the use of reference prices, such as those utilized\\n            by A[é]ropostale, materially impacts consumers’\\n            behavior. A reference price affects a consumer’s\\n            perception of the value of the transaction, the\\n            consumer’s willingness to make the purchase, and the\\n            amount of money the consumer is willing to pay for the\\n            product.\\n\\n            33. Indeed, sellers understand that a product’s\\n            “regular” or “reference” price -- the price at which it is\\n            typically sold in the marketplace -- matters to\\n            consumers, as does a representation that a product is on\\n            “sale” or is discounted.\\n\\n            34. . . . consumers are much more likely to purchase an\\n            item if they are told that it is being offered at a “sale”\\n            or discounted price that is lower than the price at which\\n            the seller previously sold the product, and/or where\\n            consumers are told that an item is worth much more\\n            than what they are currently being asked to pay for it.\\n            As the old adage says, “everyone loves a bargain.”\\n\\nAnd in support of those allegations, plaintiffs cite to ten consumer behavior\\n\\nresearch articles in their complaint.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      Despite plaintiffs’ specific and detailed allegations, the majority\\n\\nconcludes, contrary to the Attorney General’s formidable contentions in his\\n\\nmerits brief and at oral argument before us, that plaintiffs failed to plead that\\n\\nthey suffered an ascertainable loss. Ante at ___ (slip op. at 18). I respectfully\\n                                        15\\n disagree. “An ascertainable loss is a loss that is ‘quantifiable or measurable’;\\n\\nit is not ‘hypothetical or illusory.’” Lee, \\n203 N.J. at 522\\n (quoting Thiedemann,\\n\\n183 N.J. at 248\\n). We have articulated that “[t]he CFA does not demand that a\\n\\nplaintiff necessarily point to an actually suffered loss or to an incurred loss,\\n\\nbut only to one that is ‘ascertainable.’” Bosland, \\n197 N.J. at 559\\n. And “[i]n\\n\\ncases involving breach of contract or misrepresentation, either out-of-pocket\\n\\nloss or a demonstration of loss in value will suffice to meet the ascertainable\\n\\nloss hurdle and will set the stage for establishing the measure of damages.”\\n\\nThiedemann, \\n183 N.J. at 248\\n.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      This Court has acknowledged that because a plain meaning cannot be\\n\\nascribed to the term “ascertainable loss” and legislative history does not\\n\\n“shed[] direct light” on its meaning, “[w]e must look to the clear objectives of\\n\\nthe [CFA] itself, informed by well-established remedies available in a typical\\n\\nbreach-of-contract case, to find the meaning of ascertainable loss.” Furst, \\n182\\n\\nN.J. at 11\\n. Thus, a court’s analysis of ascertainable loss “is informed by basic\\n\\nprinciples of contract law” including, as we have recognized in Furst and as\\n\\nthe majority identifies, the benefit-of-the-bargain theory. \\nId. at 13\\n; see ante at\\n\\n___ (slip op. at 16). That is where I begin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        16\\n       Under a benefit-of-the-bargain theory, “the innocent party must be given\\n\\nthe ‘benefit of his bargain’ and placed in ‘as good a position as he would have\\n\\nbeen in had the contract been performed.’” Furst, \\n182 N.J. at 13\\n (quoting\\n\\nScully v. US WATS, Inc., \\n238 F.3d 497\\n, 512 (3d Cir. 2001)). In other words,\\n\\n“the innocent party has a right to damages ‘based on his expectation interest as\\n\\nmeasured by . . . the loss in the value to him’ caused by the breaching party’s\\n\\nnonperformance.” \\nIbid.\\n (omission in original) (quoting Restatement (Second)\\n\\nof Contracts § 347(a) (Am.

Thus, the benefit-of-the-bargain\\n\\ntheory is applicable, as the majority precisely identifies, “[w]hen a consumer\\n\\nclaims that there is a difference in value between an item as advertised and the\\n\\nitem as delivered, but the item is not worthless.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 16).\\n\\n      In Smajlaj v.

There, the late Judge\\n\\nJerome B. Simandle insightfully explained that the benefit-of-the-bargain\\n\\ntheory “requires nothing more than that the consumer was misled into buying a\\n\\nproduct that was ultimately worth less to the consumer than the product he was\\n\\npromised.” \\nIbid.\\n Thus, in agreement with the majority, to determine\\n\\nascertainable loss utilizing a benefit-of-the-bargain theory, we compare “what\\n\\n                                       17\\n consumers actually received to what they would objectively expect to receive,\\n\\nbased on their bargain.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 17).\\n\\n      The majority, however, asserts that plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege\\n\\nan ascertainable loss under the benefit-of-the-bargain theory because the items\\n\\nplaintiffs received were not alleged to be “defective,” “damaged,” or “worth\\n\\nless than they paid.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 23). Instead, as the majority\\n\\ncontends, the plaintiffs received exactly what they were promised and\\n\\npurchased. Ante at ___ (slip op. at 23). But, in his well-reasoned opinion,\\n\\nJudge Simandle correctly pointed out that even though it “is often the case that\\n\\nthe difference between the promised product and the product actually received\\n\\nis some defect or flaw in the product, there is no requirement that the product\\n\\nactually received be defective or deficient in any way other than that it is not\\n\\nwhat was promised.” Campbell Soup Co., 782 F. Supp. 2d at 99; see also\\n\\nUnion Ink Co., Inc. v. AT&T Corp., \\n352 N.J. Super. 617\\n, 646 (App. Div.\\n\\n2002) (“An ascertainable loss occurs when a consumer receives less than what\\n\\nwas promised.”). That is indeed what plaintiffs alleged here.\\n\\n      And in Thiedemann, we stated that as to the plaintiffs’ benefit-of-the-\\n\\nbargain claims, the plaintiffs would need to provide evidence “to support or\\n\\ninfer a quantifiable loss” because “subjective assertions without more are\\n\\ninsufficient to satisfy the requirement of an ascertainable loss that is expressly\\n\\n                                        18\\n necessary for access to the CFA remedies.” \\n183 N.J. at 252\\n. Of course, a\\n\\nconsumer’s expectations of what was promised must be objective and\\n\\nreasonable. But as Judge Simandle aptly explained in Campbell Soup Co., if a\\n\\n“consumer received a product that ‘was worth objectively less than what one\\n\\ncould reasonably expect,’ then that type of defeated expectation is an injury.”\\n\\n782 F. Supp. 2d at 99-100. Plaintiffs adequately alleged that their reasonable\\n\\nexpectations were not met because they “did not enjoy the actual discounts\\n\\nAéropostale represented and promised to them,” and that, based on the\\n\\nreference price, “the items they purchased were not in fact worth the inflated\\n\\namount that Aéropostale represented to them.” On a Rule 4:6-2(e) motion, we\\n\\nmust accept those allegations as true.\\n\\n      Our reasoning in Furst and consumer behavior research further supports\\n\\nmy conclusion that, here, plaintiffs pleaded ascertainable loss utilizing a\\n\\nbenefit-of-the-bargain theory. Plaintiffs alleged that they did not receive what\\n\\nthey reasonably expected -- an expectation premised on what Aéropostale\\n\\nfalsely promised, and further, the loss plaintiffs suffered as a result is\\n\\nobjectively measurable and quantifiable.\\n\\n      To illustrate this, I first turn to our discussion in Furst which itself is\\n\\ncentered on consumer behavior and perception, and how courts can reasonably\\n\\nquantify the “replacement value” of an item to assess the damages warranted\\n\\n                                         19\\n for a CFA claim. 4 Furst, 182 N.J. at 14-18. In concluding that the regular list\\n\\nprice on an item’s price tag may be evidence of replacement value, the Furst\\n\\nCourt emphasized that “[m]erchants understand that one of the central tenets\\n\\nof market psychology is that consumers do not want to pay full retail price and\\n\\nare always in search of the best deal.” Id. at 17 (emphasis added). Relying on\\n\\nconsumer behavior studies, the Furst Court candidly discussed how placing a\\n\\nreference price and a sales price on a particular item “focuses consumers’\\n\\nattention on the difference between the two prices. This leads to a perception\\n\\nof greater value concerning the purchase of the product.” Ibid. (quoting Bruce\\n\\nL. Alford & Abhijit Biswas, The Effects of Discount Level, Price\\n\\nConsciousness and Sale Proneness on Consumers’ Price Perception and\\n\\nBehavioral Intention, 55 J. Bus. Res. 775, 775 (2002)).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  The majority distinguishes Furst stating that, unlike this appeal concerning\\nascertainable loss, the Furst Court focused on the award of damages, and that\\n“[t]here is no calculation of ‘damages sustained’ unless the ascertainable loss\\nrequirement is first satisfied.” D’Agostino v. Maldonado, \\n216 N.J. 168\\n, 192\\n(2013). But the majority respectfully failed to consider another aspect of\\nD’Agostino -- that “‘[a]scertainable loss’ and ‘damages sustained’ are not . . .\\nunrelated to one another.” \\nIbid.\\n (emphases added). The Court goes on to state\\nthat “[i]n a given case, the same quantifiable loss of money or other property,\\nsuffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant’s CFA violation, may\\nserve both purposes in the analysis, consistent with the statute’s remedial\\nintent and the requirement of proving damages with certainty.” Id. at 193\\n(emphasis added).\\n                                          20\\n       In addition, like my original hypothetical concerning a consumer being\\n\\ninduced into purchasing a purportedly $1,000 coat offered for $300,\\n\\n“consumers are less likely to search other retail locations and have an\\n\\nincreased likelihood of purchase” when fictitious pricing like that of\\n\\nAéropostale’s exists. Ibid. (quoting Alford & Biswas, 55 J. Bus. Res. at 775).\\n\\nRecognizing that consumers have a “commonsense desire to buy at a reduced\\n\\nprice,” ibid., and that retailers are “expected to know the value of the\\n\\nmerchandise they place for sale to the public,” id. at 18, this Court held that\\n\\n            [t]he strong remedial policy undergirding the [CFA]\\n            leads us to conclude that the regular price advertised on\\n            the sales sticker is a relevant benchmark from which to\\n            impute replacement value. Accordingly, there will be\\n            a rebuttable presumption that the regular price on the\\n            sales sticker is the replacement value of the [item].\\n\\n            [Id. at 18-19 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).]\\n\\nTo support the assertion of this rebuttable presumption, we noted in Furst how\\n\\n            [w]e are mindful that misleading advertising is a\\n            deceptive commercial practice. It is a deceptive\\n            practice under the [CFA] for a retailer to artificially\\n            inflate the price for an item of merchandise for the\\n            purpose of advertising the item at a large reduction. . . .\\n            [W]e believe that an unscrupulous merchant might\\n            pause before inflating a regular price on a sales sticker\\n            if that price was evidence of replacement value.\\n            Therefore, the rebuttable presumption that regular price\\n            equals replacement value may deter some merchants\\n            who might otherwise inflate the regular price to make\\n            the sale more appealing to the public.\\n\\n                                        21\\n              [Id. at 20 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).]\\n\\nAnd in interpreting the Division of Consumer Affairs’ regulations defining a\\n\\n“former price in ‘a price reduction advertisement,’” we stated unequivocally\\n\\nthat “the regular price must bear some relationship to what the retailer\\n\\nconsidered to be the market value of the merchandise ‘in the recent, regular\\n\\ncourse of his business.’” Id. at 16-17 (quoting B. Sanfield, Inc. v. Finlay Fine\\n\\nJewelry Corp., \\n258 F.3d 578\\n, 580 (7th Cir. 2001)).\\n\\n      In other words, we recognized in Furst that a reference price or former\\n\\nprice may be equated with the value of an item. See 182 N.J. at 18-19. Thus,\\n\\ncontrary to the majority’s apparent conclusion that plaintiffs held subjective\\n\\nand unreasonable expectations about the items’ value, and applying what this\\n\\nCourt has said in Furst, it is objectively reasonable for a consumer to believe\\n\\nthat a former price or reference price is illustrative of the value of an item. See\\n\\nalso Hinojos v. Kohl’s Corp., \\n718 F.3d 1098\\n, 1105-06 (9th Cir. 2013)\\n\\n(discussing that to some consumers “a product’s ‘regular’ or ‘original’ price\\n\\nmatters; it provides important information about the product’s worth and the\\n\\nprestige that ownership of that product conveys”). Notably, this behavior\\n\\nwhere a consumer equates a reference price with value is exactly “why\\n\\nretailers . . . have an incentive to advertise false ‘sales.’” Id. at 1106.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         22\\n       If a plaintiff pleads that the retailer’s reference price represented to the\\n\\nconsumer was false or inflated, then the consumer has been deceived and has\\n\\nshown ascertainable loss by the consumer’s objective reasonable belief that\\n\\nthey received an item of less value than what the retailer represented and\\n\\npromised. Furst illustrates how this Court has prioritized deterring the\\n\\ndeceptive practice of fictitious pricing, see 182 N.J. at 20, and I would uphold\\n\\nthose long-standing principles by reinstating plaintiffs’ complaint.\\n\\n      Lastly, recent consumer behavior research analyzing fictitious pricing\\n\\nand its impact on consumers provides additional support that plaintiffs\\n\\nsufficiently pleaded an objective, reasonable, and measurable ascertainable\\n\\nloss. Despite being acknowledged in plaintiffs’ complaint, the majority fails to\\n\\nconsider the body of research showing (1) how consumers equate a product’s\\n\\nformer price with its value and quality, and (2) that consumers place value on\\n\\nthe bargain itself. 5\\n\\n      In his article centered on fictitious pricing, Professor David Adam\\n\\nFriedman discusses how “[a] higher fictitious ‘former price’ disingenuously\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  Plaintiffs cite ten articles in their complaint to support their allegations. I\\nbuild upon the research plaintiffs provide to include more published articles in\\nthis dissent to illustrate how this body of academic research continues to grow\\nnationally, adding further support to plaintiffs’ allegations that consumer\\nbehavior is greatly impacted by this deceptive practice.\\n                                          23\\n causes the consumer to attach a higher level of value to an item than it would\\n\\nhave had the pricing been honest,” and describes how “[c]onsumers may also\\n\\nuse a former reference price as a signal of quality.” David Adam Friedman,\\n\\nReconsidering Fictitious Pricing, \\n100 Minn. L. Rev. 921\\n, 934-35 (2016). More\\n\\nspecifically, Professor Friedman explains that\\n\\n            [i]f the price signal is genuine -- i.e., the good was once\\n            offered in a bona fide manner at a higher price, the\\n            advertised discount communicates the availability of a\\n            true bargain. . . . If the signal proves false, however,\\n            the consumer transacts on a false association of quality.\\n\\n            [Id. at 935 (emphasis added).]\\n\\n      Mark Armstrong and Yongmin Chen further discuss in their article on\\n\\ndiscount pricing two reasons why a consumer is more willing to purchase an\\n\\nitem with a discounted price as compared to a low initial price: (1) “a high\\n\\ninitial price can indicate the seller has chosen to supply a high-quality product”\\n\\nand (2) “when a seller with limited stock runs a clearance sale, later consumers\\n\\ninfer that unsold stock has higher expected quality when its initial price was\\n\\nhigher.” Mark Armstrong & Yongmin Chen, Discount Pricing, 58 Econ.\\n\\nInquiry 1614, 1614 (2020).\\n\\n      Moreover, researchers Richard Staelin, Joel E. Urbany, and Donald\\n\\nNgwe recently published a study on fictitious pricing and explained how there\\n\\nis “robust and empirically documented observation[s] that when most\\n\\n                                        24\\n consumers buy a product, they consider not only the actual transaction price\\n\\n. . . but also the expected savings relative to some normal (reference) price.”\\n\\nStaelin, Urbany, & Ngwe, 87 J. of Mktg. at 830. The researchers explain that\\n\\nan “attractive deal” has the ability “to disrupt search and encourage a\\n\\nconsumer to stop [searching for goods] even earlier, since the deal increases\\n\\nthe perceived utility of the offering and, thus, the offering is more likely to\\n\\nmeet or exceed the expected value of the consumer’s outside option.” Id. at\\n\\n831 (citations omitted); see also Gorkan Ahmetoglu, Adrian Furnham, &\\n\\nPatrick Fagan, Pricing Practices: A Critical Review of their Effects on\\n\\nConsumer Perceptions and Behaviour, 21 J. of Retailing & Consumer Servs.\\n\\n696, 699 (2014) (discussing how numerous studies taken together illustrate\\n\\nthat “the presence of a reference price increases consumers’ deal valuations\\n\\nand purchase intentions and can lower their search intentions as compared to\\n\\nthe case where a reference price is absent”).\\n\\n                                        D.\\n\\n      Taking into consideration (1) the CFA’s strong remedial purpose to\\n\\nprotect consumers, (2) the Legislature’s intent to cement the CFA as “one of\\n\\nthe strongest consumer protection laws in the nation” by creating a private\\n\\nright of action to assist in reducing the Attorney General’s enforcement\\n\\nburdens, Bosland, \\n197 N.J. at 555\\n (emphasis added), (3) our case precedents,\\n\\n                                        25\\n (4) consumer behavior research, and (5) the invaluable practical insight\\n\\nprovided by the Attorney General appearing as amicus, it is clear to me that\\n\\nplaintiffs here have sufficiently pleaded that they suffered an ascertainable loss\\n\\nunder a benefit-of-the-bargain theory after being deceived by Aéropostale’s\\n\\nfictitious pricing scheme.\\n\\n      Contrary to the majority’s view, plaintiffs’ ascertainable loss is objective\\n\\nand reasonable. As alleged in the complaint, plaintiffs reasonably believed --\\n\\nwhen viewing the discounts advertised and promised by Aéropostale -- that the\\n\\nproducts were worth a higher value but were being sold at a discounted price,\\n\\nyielding a certain amount of savings. Based on our reasoning in Furst and\\n\\nconsumer behavior research, it is apparent that these beliefs are common and\\n\\nreasonable among consumers. In fact, that is exactly why retailers engage in\\n\\nthe deceptive practice of fictitious pricing. See Hinojos, 718 F.3d at 1106;\\n\\nFurst, \\n182 N.J. at 17\\n (“Merchants draw consumers into their stores by holding\\n\\nsales events . . . that promise the regular value of a product at a reduced\\n\\nprice.”).\\n\\n      Although plaintiffs do not allege that they received “defective” products\\n\\n(i.e., non-wearable clothing), as was the case in Furst, a “defective” or\\n\\n“flawed” product is not always required to show ascertainable loss under the\\n\\nbenefit-of-the-bargain theory. See Campbell Soup Co., 782 F. Supp. 2d at 99\\n\\n                                        26\\n (“[T]here is no requirement that the product actually received be defective or\\n\\ndeficient in any way other than that it is not what was promised.”). It is\\n\\nenough at the motion-to-dismiss stage that plaintiffs alleged they “received\\n\\nitems worth far less than the value claimed by [d]efendant.” (emphasis added).\\n\\nMoreover, what Aéropostale promised based on the information it provided\\n\\n(i.e., reference prices), were products worth a higher value and a realization in\\n\\nsavings. Plaintiffs received neither and, therefore, contrary to the majority’s\\n\\nconclusion, plaintiffs did not receive “exactly what they knowingly\\n\\npurchased.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 23).\\n\\n      And importantly, plaintiffs’ ascertainable loss is measurable and\\n\\nquantifiable as the difference between the reference price on the products and\\n\\nthe amount they actually purchased the products for -- i.e., reference price\\n\\nminus (-) purchase price equals (=) ascertainable loss. Applying that formula\\n\\nto the facts alleged in the complaint concerning the “hoodie” Robey purchased,\\n\\nRobey’s ascertainable loss can be quantified by looking at the difference\\n\\nbetween $59.95 (the reference price) and what she paid for the “hoodie,”\\n\\n$23.98 (the purchase price), which equals $35.97. That equation, one that the\\n\\nAttorney General urges this Court to utilize, would be similarly applied to the\\n\\nadditional factual allegations made by plaintiffs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       27\\n       Although the majority identifies that other jurisdictions have declined to\\n\\nhold that consumers are injured by rampant fictitious pricing schemes, we\\n\\nmust not forget the legislative history and intent surrounding the enactment of\\n\\nthe CFA’s private cause of action: “to ‘give New Jersey one of the strongest\\n\\nconsumer protection laws in the nation.’” Bosland, \\n197 N.J. at 555\\n (emphasis\\n\\nadded).\\n\\n                                        V.\\n\\n      Although the issue of whether plaintiffs have pleaded out-of-pocket loss\\n\\nneed not be reached given my conclusions that plaintiffs have sufficiently\\n\\npleaded ascertainable loss under the benefit-of-the-bargain theory, I cannot\\n\\nignore Judge Maritza Berdote Byrne’s thoughtful concurring opinion that\\n\\nplaintiffs sufficiently pleaded an ascertainable loss under the out-of-pocket\\n\\nloss theory. See Robey v. SPARC Grp. LLC, \\n474 N.J. Super. 593\\n, 606 (App.\\n\\nDiv. 2023) (Berdote Byrne, J.S.C. (temporarily assigned), concurring).\\n\\nTherefore, I will briefly discuss the applicability of out-of-pocket loss theory\\n\\nto the present case.\\n\\n      “[O]ut-of-pocket loss . . . will suffice to meet the ascertainable loss\\n\\nhurdle . . . .” Thiedemann, \\n183 N.J. at 248\\n. A plaintiff can suffer an out-of-\\n\\npocket loss that is ascertainable and that is equated to the purchase price of the\\n\\nproduct when the plaintiff purchases a completely worthless item. See Lee,\\n\\n                                        28\\n 203 N.J. at 527-28\\n (concluding that when representations about a product are\\n\\n“baseless” then the out-of-pocket loss is the purchase “of the worthless\\n\\nproduct”). A plaintiff may also illustrate an out-of-pocket loss if they spent\\n\\nmoney to repair a defective product. See Thiedemann, \\n183 N.J. at 251-52\\n.\\n\\n      The majority correctly asserts that the present case is distinguishable\\n\\nfrom past decisions, ante at ___ (slip op. at 20-21), but it does not adequately\\n\\nconsider Dugan v. TGI Fridays, Inc., \\n231 N.J. 24\\n (2017). In Dugan, where the\\n\\nplaintiffs brought a class action CFA claim against a restaurant that did not list\\n\\nthe price of beverages on its menus, we noted that “[i]ndividual plaintiffs may\\n\\nbe able to establish ascertainable loss and causation by showing that they\\n\\nwould not have purchased the beverages or would have spent less money on\\n\\nthem had they been informed of their cost.” Id. at 60. Here, plaintiffs allege --\\n\\nand we must accept the allegations as true at this stage -- that “they would not\\n\\nhave purchased the [clothing] items at the prices they paid had they known the\\n\\nitems had not been regularly offered or sold at the higher list price,” or had\\n\\nthey been informed that the discounts were false. Therefore, plaintiffs here\\n\\nsuffered an out-of-pocket loss that is ascertainable, i.e., the purchase price of\\n\\nthe clothing items.\\n\\n      Other jurisdictions have adopted this approach or similar approaches to\\n\\nout-of-pocket loss. In Munning v. Gap, Inc., a case with substantially similar\\n\\n                                        29\\n facts to the present appeal, the United States District Court for the Northern\\n\\nDistrict of California interpreted the New Jersey CFA and held that the\\n\\nplaintiffs sufficiently pleaded an out-of-pocket loss because the plaintiffs\\n\\nalleged that they would not have purchased the products if the plaintiffs knew\\n\\nthat the discounts were false, even though the items the plaintiffs purchased\\n\\nwere not worthless. \\n238 F. Supp. 3d 1195\\n, 1201 (N.D. Cal. 2017).\\n\\n      Moreover, in Hinojos, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\\n\\nCircuit, interpreting California law, held “that when a consumer purchases\\n\\nmerchandise on the basis of false price information, and when the consumer\\n\\nalleges that he would not have made the purchase but for the\\n\\nmisrepresentation, he has standing to sue . . . because he has suffered an\\n\\neconomic injury.” 718 F.3d at 1107. Although standing to sue under\\n\\nCalifornia law is slightly different than the ascertainable loss requirement\\n\\nunder the CFA, the general principles regarding harm and loss to the consumer\\n\\napply.\\n\\n      And most recently in Clark v. Eddie Bauer LLC, another case with\\n\\nsimilar facts to the present case, the Oregon Supreme Court held that, under\\n\\nOregon law, “when a person acts in response to [a store’s] deception by\\n\\nspending money that the person would not otherwise have spent, the person\\n\\nhas been injured to the extent of the purchase price as a result of that\\n\\n                                        30\\n deception.” \\n532 P.3d 880\\n, 893 (Or. 2023) (emphasis added). In other words,\\n\\nif a “plaintiff paid money . . . for articles of clothing that she would not have\\n\\nbought had she known their true price history,” then “[t]he money that [the]\\n\\nplaintiff is out as a result is her ‘loss.’” Id. at 891 (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Thus, here, because plaintiffs alleged that they would not have\\n\\npurchased the items had they known the discounts were false, they arguably\\n\\nsufficiently pleaded an out-of-pocket loss that would equate to the purchase\\n\\nprice of the items.\\n\\n      The fact that plaintiffs did not allege that they attempted to return the\\n\\nitems is of no moment, especially at this stage in the litigation. Our decision\\n\\nin Bosland is instructive of this point. We held in Bosland that “the CFA does\\n\\nnot require a consumer, who has been victimized by a practice which the\\n\\nstatute is designed to remedy, to seek a refund from the offending merchant as\\n\\na prerequisite to filing a complaint.” \\n197 N.J. at 547-48\\n. Importantly, we\\n\\nemphasized that interpreting the CFA to require a pre-suit demand “would\\n\\npotentially permit practices, that the statute is designed to deter, . . . to\\n\\ncontinue unabated and unpunished.” \\nId. at 561\\n. We maintained that “[s]uch\\n\\nan analysis of the CFA would limit relief by making it available only to those\\n\\nconsumers who are alert enough to ask for a refund, while allowing the\\n\\noffending merchant to reap a windfall.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n                                          31\\n       Thus, our precedent does not support the notion that for plaintiffs here to\\n\\nsuccessfully plead ascertainable loss under an out-of-pocket loss theory, they\\n\\nmust have attempted to return the items. Just because plaintiffs could have\\n\\nreturned the items and “theoretically, could have secured complete relief in no\\n\\nway diminishes the fact that” plaintiffs “sustained an immediate quantifiable\\n\\nloss” when they were tricked into purchasing items they otherwise would not\\n\\nhave paid for due to defendant’s misrepresentations. \\nId. at 559\\n.\\n\\n                                       VI.\\n\\n      Echoing our sentiments from twenty years ago in Furst, the CFA “cannot\\n\\nbe construed to allow an offending merchant to benefit from his own\\n\\ndeception.” 182 N.J. at 14. I would have let this case proceed in the ordinary\\n\\ncourse: discovery, motion practice if warranted, then trial. I therefore dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       32\\n '),\n",

According to testimony, they never built a structure on that lot or on the\\nadjacent lot they also owned because “the economic situations [were] really bad,”\\nand they did not purchase liability insurance to cover the lot because insurance\\ncompanies “didn’t really want to insure it.”\\n\\n        In April 2020, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that defendants’ negligence\\nin failing to reasonably maintain the sidewalk abutting the subject lot caused her fall\\nand resulting injuries. Defendants moved for summary judgment. The trial court\\ngranted defendants’ motion, holding they did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff.\\nThe court relied heavily on Abraham v. Gupta, 281 N.J. Super. 81 (App. Div. 1995),\\nwhich held that the liability imposed on commercial property owners to reasonably\\nmaintain abutting sidewalks does not apply to sidewalks abutting vacant lots. The\\ncourt reasoned that defendants did not have a duty to maintain the sidewalk because\\nit abutted a vacant lot that was not generating any income, citing Stewart v. 104\\nWallace Street, Inc., 87 N.J. 146 (1981). The trial court rejected plaintiff’s\\ncontention that summary judgment was improper because a Camden municipal\\nordinance required defendants to maintain the lot’s abutting sidewalk, explaining\\nthat municipal ordinances do not create a separate common law duty. The Appellate\\nDivision affirmed. The Court granted certification. 253 N.J. 570 (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Considerations of fairness lead the Court to hold that all commercial\\nlandowners -- including owners of vacant commercial lots -- have a duty to maintain\\nthe public sidewalks abutting their property in reasonably good condition and are\\n\\n                                           1\\n liable to pedestrians injured as a result of their negligent failure to do so. Consistent\\nwith the rule it adopts today, the Court reverses the Appellate Division’s judgment\\nand remands the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.\\n\\n1. “Whether a person owes a duty of reasonable care toward another turns on\\nwhether the imposition of such a duty satisfies an abiding sense of basic fairness\\nunder all of the circumstances in light of considerations of public policy.” Hopkins\\nv. Fox & Lazo Realtors, 132 N.J. 426, 439 (1993). With regard to sidewalk liability,\\nNew Jersey courts adhered until fairly recently to the common law rule that an\\nabutting owner of commercial or residential property was liable only for negligent\\nconstruction or repair of a sidewalk, not for maintaining sidewalks against wear and\\ntear, which was the responsibility of the government. In Stewart, the Court\\ncharacterized the previous “no liability” rule as “anachronistic” and as “produc[ing]\\nharsh and unfair results,” 87 N.J. at 150, and it held that “commercial landowners\\nare responsible for maintaining in reasonably good condition the sidewalks abutting\\ntheir property and are liable to pedestrians injured as a result of their negligent\\nfailure to do so,” id. at 149, 157. The Court concluded that imposing this duty on\\ncommercial property owners was fair because they retain substantial interests in\\nabutting sidewalks, which provide “easy access to [and from] their premises and\\nincrease the value of their property,” and they are in “an ideal position to inspect\\nsidewalks and to take prompt action to cure defects.” Id. at 151-52, 158. The Court\\nexpressly limited imposing the duty to maintain abutting sidewalks to commercial --\\nnot residential -- properties. Id. at 159. (pp. 9-17)\\n\\n2. The Appellate Division has frequently probed the gray area of whether mixed-use\\n“residential” property has been converted into “commercial” for sidewalk liability\\npurposes by analyzing the various uses of properties at issue. In Abraham, the\\nAppellate Division found that the owner of a vacant lot zoned for commercial use\\ndid not owe a duty to a pedestrian injured on the abutting sidewalk, limiting\\nStewart’s application to commercial properties with the “capacity to generate\\nincome.” 281 N.J. Super. at 82-85. Gray v. Caldwell Wood Products, Inc. likewise\\nfocused on income potential and found that the owner of a then-vacant commercial\\nbuilding -- which the owner marketed for sale, insured, and permitted prospective\\nbuyers to inspect -- did owe a duty to a pedestrian injured on the sidewalk. 425 N.J.\\nSuper. 496, 498, 501 (App. Div. 2012). In Ellis v. Hilton United Methodist Church,\\nthe Appellate Division focused on whether a vacant church was a “commercial\\nbuilding” and held that, because it was not, the defendants had no duty to maintain\\nthe abutting sidewalk. 455 N.J. Super. 33, 40 (App. Div. 2018). (pp. 18-23)\\n\\n3. As noted in Hopkins, whether a duty exists is ultimately a question of fairness.\\nThat guiding principle leads the Court to conclude that a duty should be imposed on\\nall owners of vacant commercial lots to maintain the abutting sidewalks in\\nreasonably good condition. Purchasing a vacant commercial lot is a business\\n                                            2\\n decision that embraces the attendant costs and burdens of conducting business. The\\nCourt concludes that one of those costs necessarily includes maintaining the abutting\\nsidewalks so that they are in a reasonably safe condition for innocent passersby.\\nThe Court rejects the suggestion to base liability on potential profitability as an\\nunworkable approach that will only further confuse commercial sidewalk liability\\nlaw, lead to inconsistent results, and unfairly harm the public. Abraham, Gray, and\\nEllis illustrate the difficulty of employing a case-by-case, commercial-property-by-\\ncommercial-property approach to determining when a duty is owed. In the Court’s\\nview, it matters not that there is no structure or active business being conducted on a\\ncommercial property. The Court notes that Stewart’s sidewalk liability distinction\\nshould be between commercial and residential properties, not among certain types of\\ncommercial properties, or commercial properties with buildings, or commercial\\nproperties with active, potentially profitable entities on them. The bright-line rule\\narticulated today -- that all commercial property owners owe a duty to maintain\\nabutting sidewalks in reasonably good condition -- will ensure fairness, consistency,\\nand predictability going forward. To the extent that Abraham conflicts with the\\nCourt’s decision, it is overruled. The Court implores the Legislature to address the\\nissue of commercial sidewalk liability. (pp. 24-32)\\n\\n      REVERSED. REMANDED to the trial court.\\n\\n       JUSTICE SOLOMON, dissenting, writes that the meaning of the well-\\nreasoned and consistent decisions of Stewart, Abraham, and Gray is clear:\\ncommercial property owners with a capacity to generate income are liable for\\ninjuries caused by their failure to maintain their adjacent sidewalks. Noting that the\\nCourt and the Appellate Division have developed a common thread of factors to\\ndetermine whether a commercial property has the capacity to generate income,\\nJustice Solomon explains that, apart from the commercial zoning of defendants’\\nproperty -- which under Abraham is insufficient to impose liability -- defendants’\\nproperty has no characteristics of an income-generating property. Justice Solomon\\ndisagrees with the decision to overrule Abraham and expresses the view that the\\nmajority’s decision infringes on legislative authority because the Legislature\\ndelegated to elected municipal officers the authority to impose sidewalk liability in\\nN.J.S.A. 40:65-14. Justice Solomon notes that here, the elected leaders of Camden\\nchose to act upon that authority by requiring in the City Code that sidewalks be\\nmaintained by and at the expense of property owners but chose to leave enforcement\\nof that rule to the municipality itself rather than create a private cause of action.\\nJustice Solomon would thus affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment.\\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES FASCIALE and NORIEGA join in\\nJUSTICE PIERRE-LOUIS’s opinion.

Over the course of a century, this\\n\\nCourt’s jurisprudence regarding public sidewalk liability has evolved with the\\n\\ntimes and changing views of what is fair in this area of the law.\\n\\n      In this appeal, we are asked to determine whether owners of vacant\\n\\ncommercial lots have a common law duty to maintain the public sidewalks\\n\\nabutting those lots in reasonably good condition.\\n\\n      In 2019, plaintiff Alejandra Padilla allegedly tripped, fell, and suffered\\n\\nserious injuries while walking on the public sidewalk abutting a vacant\\n\\ncommercial lot in Camden owned by defendants Young Il An and Myo Soon\\n\\nAn. Plaintiff sued defendants for negligence, claiming that their failure to\\n\\nreasonably maintain the sidewalk caused her fall and consequent injuries.\\n\\nDefendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that they did not owe her a\\n\\nduty of care. The trial court granted defendants’ motion and the Appellate\\n\\nDivision affirmed, holding that “the owner of a non-income producing vacant\\n\\ncommercial lot has no duty to the public to maintain the lot’s abutting\\n\\nsidewalk in a safe condition.”\\n\\n      We now reverse. Considerations of fairness lead us to conclude that a\\n\\nduty should be imposed on owners of vacant commercial lots. Accordingly,\\n\\nwe hold that all commercial landowners -- including owners of vacant\\n\\n                                        2\\n commercial lots -- have a duty to maintain the public sidewalks abutting their\\n\\nproperty in reasonably good condition and are liable to pedestrians injured as a\\n\\nresult of their negligent failure to do so. Consistent with the rule we adopt\\n\\ntoday, we reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment and remand the matter to\\n\\nthe trial court for further proceedings.\\n\\n                                           I.\\n\\n                                           A.\\n\\n      The following facts are derived from the pretrial record.\\n\\n      On September 11, 2019, plaintiff allegedly tripped, fell, and suffered\\n\\ninjuries on the sidewalk abutting a vacant commercial lot located at 2605-2609\\n\\nWestfield Avenue in Camden. Plaintiff testified at her deposition that she\\n\\nsuffered several injuries from the fall, including a broken foot and injured arm,\\n\\nand that she underwent surgery for her injuries. Plaintiff further testified that\\n\\nshe continued to suffer symptoms, including migraines, pain, and memory loss.\\n\\n      At the time of plaintiff’s fall, defendants owned the subject lot.\\n\\nDefendants purchased it 27 years before plaintiff’s fall in March 1992.\\n\\nDefendant Young Il An was the only defendant to provide deposition\\n\\ntestimony. Defendant testified that he bought the subject lot intending to\\n\\nconstruct a building there, but never did. Although the subject lot remained\\n\\nvacant during that time period, defendant testified that he visited and inspected\\n\\n                                           3\\n the subject lot with some frequency over the years, specifically “three or four\\n\\ntimes in a month.”\\n\\n      In addition to purchasing the subject lot, defendants purchased an\\n\\nadjacent lot at 2611 Westfield Avenue; that lot was also vacant. According to\\n\\ndefendant, he “thought that [he] would need [lots] 2605 to 2611 to put up a\\n\\ndecent building,” given the small size of the individual lots. When asked “is it\\n\\ntrue that you purchased 2611 Westfield in the hopes that in the future you\\n\\ncould put a building and make some money on the property?,” defendant\\n\\nresponded, “I believe it’s rather common sense that when anybody would\\n\\nmake a purchase like that, it would be in the hopes of making money\\n\\nsomeday.” When asked whether his hope was to build a property and either\\n\\nrent or sell it, defendant responded, “[i]f anybody does not think of it in that\\n\\nway, nobody should really purchase anything.” When asked whether he\\n\\npurchased as many as six properties in Camden since 1990, defendant initially\\n\\nreplied, “[i]t’s been a very long time. I really can’t remember,” but then\\n\\nstated, “currently I have gotten rid of most of them.”\\n\\n      According to defendant, they never built a structure on the subject lot or\\n\\non the adjacent lot because “the economic situations [were] really bad, so I\\n\\nhave given up doing that.” Defendant further testified that he did not purchase\\n\\nliability insurance to cover the lot because insurance companies “didn’t really\\n\\n                                         4\\n want to insure it.” Defendant could not recall which insurance company did\\n\\nnot want to insure the property. He also testified that, after plaintiff’s fall, he\\n\\nhad the sidewalk abutting the subject lot repaired.\\n\\n                                         B.\\n\\n      In April 2020, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that defendants’\\n\\nnegligence in failing to reasonably maintain the sidewalk abutting the subject\\n\\nlot caused her fall and resulting injuries. Defendants moved for summary\\n\\njudgment. After hearing oral arguments, the trial court granted defendants’\\n\\nmotion, holding that defendants did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff. The\\n\\ncourt relied heavily on the Appellate Division’s decision in Abraham v. Gupta,\\n\\n281 N.J. Super. 81 (App. Div. 1995), which held that the liability imposed on\\n\\ncommercial property owners to reasonably maintain abutting sidewalks does\\n\\nnot apply to sidewalks abutting vacant lots. The court reasoned that\\n\\ndefendants did not have a duty to maintain the sidewalk because it abutted a\\n\\nvacant lot that was not generating any income, citing this Court’s decision in\\n\\nStewart v. 104 Wallace Street, Inc., 87 N.J. 146 (1981). The trial court\\n\\nrejected plaintiff’s contention that summary judgment was improper because a\\n\\nCamden municipal ordinance required defendants to maintain the lot’s abutting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         5\\n sidewalk, 1 explaining that municipal ordinances do not create a separate\\n\\ncommon law duty.\\n\\n      Plaintiff appealed, and the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court’s\\n\\ndecision in an unpublished opinion. The Appellate Division concluded that\\n\\nAbraham remained good law that applied to the subject lot and thus declined to\\n\\nimpose on defendants the legal duty articulated in Stewart. The court held that\\n\\n“an owner of a non-income producing vacant lot owes no duty to the public to\\n\\nmaintain the lot’s abutting sidewalk in a safe condition.” The Appellate\\n\\nDivision, like the trial court, rejected plaintiff’s reliance on the Camden\\n\\nmunicipal ordinance. The court found that plaintiff failed to show that\\n\\ndefendants violated the ordinance and that, even if they had, a violation of an\\n\\nordinance directing private persons to care for public property cannot provide\\n\\nthe basis for a private cause of action.\\n\\n      Plaintiff filed a petition for certification presenting the issue of whether\\n\\nowners of vacant commercial lots owe a duty of care to pedestrians to\\n\\nreasonably maintain the sidewalks abutting those lots. We granted plaintiff’s\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Part II, Chapter 735, Section 5 of the Code of the City of Camden provides\\nin relevant part that “[t]he sidewalks in the streets of the City shall be kept in\\nrepair by the owner or owners of the abutting property at the cost and expense\\nof the owner or owners of the lands in front of which any such sidewalk is\\nconstructed.”\\n\\n                                           6\\n petition, 253 N.J. 570 (2023), and the New Jersey Civil Justice Institute’s\\n\\nmotion to appear as amicus curiae.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Plaintiff urges this Court to reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment\\n\\nand remand the matter to the trial court to apply the Stewart standard. Plaintiff\\n\\nargues that the Appellate Division in Abraham impermissibly narrowed\\n\\nStewart’s holding and insists that nothing in that decision’s language or\\n\\nrationale excuses a commercial property owner from a duty of care because\\n\\ntheir lot is vacant. Plaintiff contends that the Stewart Court distinguished\\n\\ncommercial properties from residential properties but did not distinguish\\n\\namong types of commercial properties or consider whether those properties\\n\\nhad active businesses on them. Plaintiff also asserts that imposing a duty of\\n\\ncare is fair because the subject lot was capable of generating income, like the\\n\\nvacant commercial building in Gray v. Caldwell Wood Products, Inc., 425 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 496, 501 (App. Div. 2012), and could therefore absorb the costs of\\n\\nliability insurance.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      Defendants urge us to affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment,\\n\\ncontending that they owed no duty of care to plaintiff or any member of the\\n\\n                                        7\\n public to maintain the sidewalk abutting the subject lot. Defendants claim that\\n\\nAbraham applies to this case rather than Stewart and Gray because there was\\n\\nneither a structure on the subject lot nor an active business enterprise being\\n\\nconducted on it. Defendants also argue that the policy considerations\\n\\nunderlying this Court’s opinion in Stewart -- profit-making potential and the\\n\\ncapacity to spread the risk of loss -- do not apply to vacant commercial lots\\n\\nand thus do not justify imposing a duty of care on commercial property owners\\n\\nlike themselves.\\n\\n      The New Jersey Civil Justice Institute (NJCJI), appearing as amicus\\n\\ncuriae, supports defendants’ arguments. NJCJI argues that imposing a duty on\\n\\nowners of vacant commercial lots would contravene the principles that Stewart\\n\\narticulated. NJCJI also contends that the mere potential to generate income\\n\\ndoes not warrant imposing liability on owners of vacant commercial lots.\\n\\nAccording to NJCJI, establishing a bright-line rule that owners of vacant\\n\\ncommercial lots do not owe a duty to maintain abutting sidewalks promotes\\n\\nfairness, consistency, and predictability in our court system.\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n      We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same\\n\\nstandard that governed the trial court’s determination. Samolyk v. Berthe, 251\\n\\nN.J. 73, 78 (2022). Under that standard, a court must grant summary judgment\\n\\n                                        8\\n “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on\\n\\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as\\n\\nto any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a\\n\\njudgment or order as a matter of law.” R. 4:46-2(c); Rivera v. Valley Hosp.,\\n\\nInc., 252 N.J. 1, 16 (2022).\\n\\n      We “consider whether the competent evidential materials presented,\\n\\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are\\n\\nsufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in\\n\\nfavor of the non-moving party.” Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 142\\n\\nN.J. 520, 540 (1995). When no issue of fact exists, and only a legal question\\n\\nremains, we owe no special deference to the trial court’s legal determinations.\\n\\nDeSimone v. Springpoint Senior Living, Inc., 256 N.J. 172, 181 (2024).\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      The question before us concerns the development of our state’s common\\n\\nlaw doctrine governing premises liability, a responsibility historically\\n\\nentrusted to this Court. See Hopkins v. Fox & Lazo Realtors, 132 N.J. 426,\\n\\n439 (1993) (“Determining the scope of tort liability has traditionally been the\\n\\nresponsibility of the courts.”).\\n\\n      In Hopkins, we stated that public policy and fairness considerations\\n\\nguide our determination in imposing a duty of care and formulating standards\\n\\n                                         9\\n to define that duty. Ibid. In carrying out that important function, this Court\\n\\nhas “carefully refrained from treating questions of duty in a conclusory\\n\\nfashion, recognizing that ‘[w]hether a duty exists is ultimately a question of\\n\\nfairness.’” Est. of Desir ex rel. Estiverne v. Vertus, 214 N.J. 303, 322 (2013)\\n\\n(alteration in original) (quoting Weinberg v. Dinger, 106 N.J. 469, 485\\n\\n(1987)). Indeed, we observed that “[w]hether a person owes a duty of\\n\\nreasonable care toward another turns on whether the imposition of such a duty\\n\\nsatisfies an abiding sense of basic fairness under all of the circumstances in\\n\\nlight of considerations of public policy.” Hopkins, 132 N.J. at 439. We\\n\\nexplained that the “inquiry involves identifying, weighing, and balancing\\n\\nseveral factors -- the relationship of the parties, the nature of the attendant risk,\\n\\nthe opportunity and ability to exercise care, and the public interest in the\\n\\nproposed solution.” Ibid. We also stated that the analysis is “very fact-\\n\\nspecific and principled; it must lead to solutions that properly and fairly\\n\\nresolve the specific case and generate intelligible and sensible rules to govern\\n\\nfuture conduct.” Ibid.\\n\\n      To begin, we briefly turn to the history of our sidewalk liability\\n\\njurisprudence to expound upon how the legal principles governing this area of\\n\\nlaw have developed over time in this state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         10\\n                                         1.\\n\\n      A review of our case law stretching back more than a century indicates\\n\\nthat until fairly recently, our courts adhered to the common law rule, under\\n\\nwhich an abutting owner of commercial or residential property was\\n\\n            not liable for the condition of a sidewalk caused by the\\n            action of the elements or by wear and tear incident to\\n            public use, but only for the negligent construction or\\n            repair of the sidewalk by himself or by a specified\\n            predecessor in title or for direct use or obstruction of\\n            the sidewalk by the owner in such a manner as to render\\n            it unsafe for passersby.\\n\\n            [Yanhko v. Fane, 70 N.J. 528, 532 (1976).]\\n\\n      That “no liability” rule was a product of early English common law,\\n\\nwhich provided that “the parish at large is prima facie bound to repair all\\n\\nhighways lying within it.” Stewart, 87 N.J. at 153-54 (quoting The King v.\\n\\nInhabitants of Sheffield, 2 T.R. 106, 111 (K.B. 1787)); accord Weller v.\\n\\nMcCormick, 47 N.J.L. 397, 399 (Sup. Ct. 1885) (“At common law the duty of\\n\\nkeeping highways safe for travel pertained, ordinarily, to the parish at large.”).\\n\\nThat long-standing rule placed the primary responsibility of maintaining public\\n\\nsidewalks on the government. Stewart, 87 N.J. at 154; see Mount v. Recka, 35\\n\\nN.J. Super. 374, 380 (App. Div. 1955) (“[T]he basic concept of the law has\\n\\ntraditionally placed the primary responsibility for the construction and\\n\\nmaintenance of streets and sidewalks on the government and has recognized a\\n\\n                                        11\\n distinction between the related duties of the municipal government and those\\n\\nof an abutting owner.”); see also Fischer v. Salomone, 136 N.J.L. 431, 432\\n\\n(Sup. Ct. 1948); Rupp v. Burgess, 70 N.J.L. 7, 9 (Sup. Ct. 1903).\\n\\n      Although the Court repeatedly declined to depart from the old “no\\n\\nliability” rule in subsequent cases, some members of the Court criticized the\\n\\nrule’s harshness, unfairness, and incompatibility with modern times. To\\n\\nillustrate, Justice Jacobs found the old rule “pregnant with seeds of gross\\n\\ninjustice for it tends to immunize the wrongdoer whose flagrant neglect of duty\\n\\nhas caused injury to an innocent party who is left with recourse against no\\n\\none.” Moskowitz v. Herman, 16 N.J. 223, 228-29 (1954) (Jacobs, J.,\\n\\ndissenting). Justice Proctor echoed that criticism fifteen years later in Murray\\n\\nv. Michalak, finding it “manifestly unjust to permit a property owner to sit idly\\n\\nby and watch with impunity as his sidewalk deteriorates to a point where it\\n\\nbecomes a trap for unwary pedestrians and then to immunize him from liability\\n\\nwhen the all too foreseeable injuries occur.” 58 N.J. 220, 223 (1971) (Proctor,\\n\\nJ., dissenting). Justice Proctor further observed that the old rule discouraged\\n\\nproperty owners from repairing their sidewalks for fear of doing so negligently\\n\\nand risking liability. Ibid. Noting that the “law should always reflect the\\n\\nneeds of a changing society,” Justice Proctor said he would “place such a duty\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       12\\n on all abutting property owners,” both of residential and commercial\\n\\nproperties. Id. at 225-26.\\n\\n      Despite the dissenting voices in prior cases, the Court again declined to\\n\\ndepart from the “no liability” rule in Yanhko in 1976, reasoning that the public\\n\\neasement belonging to pedestrians leaves the abutting property owner with no\\n\\ncontrol or dominion over the sidewalk, such that the owner cannot “properly . .\\n\\n. be described as ‘maintaining’” the sidewalk. 70 N.J. at 533. The majority of\\n\\nthe Court concluded that it would be arbitrary to impose a duty on an abutting\\n\\nproperty owner “for no better reason than that his property is proximate to” the\\n\\nsidewalk. Id. at 534. The majority opined that it was the Legislature’s role to\\n\\n“regulate such liability, not for the courts to impose it on the abutting owner as\\n\\na convenient subject of liability.” Ibid. (footnote omitted).\\n\\n      In yet another compelling dissenting opinion, Justice Pashman asserted\\n\\nthat “the landowner is not the powerless figure portrayed by the majority”\\n\\ngiven the various limitations placed upon the public easement to his economic\\n\\nbenefit. Id. at 542 (Pashman, J., dissenting). He noted that commercial\\n\\nlandowners “strongly encourage use of the sidewalk” to facilitate the success\\n\\nof their businesses, ibid., and warned that further adherence to the old rule\\n\\nwould continue to produce undesirable and unfair results, id. at 546. Like\\n\\nJustice Proctor in Murray, Justice Pashman explained that the old rule\\n\\n                                       13\\n disincentivizes a landowner from repairing a deteriorating sidewalk: because\\n\\nthe landowner “may incur liability if he repairs a sidewalk in a negligent\\n\\nfashion, it is more advantageous for him to ignore the defective conditions\\n\\naltogether.” Ibid. Justice Pashman cautioned that “[t]he practical operation of\\n\\nthis rule produces a result which hardly comports with current standards of\\n\\njustice.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                         2.\\n\\n      Five years later, in Stewart, the Court broke new ground and created an\\n\\nexception to the “no liability” rule that had been the law for decades\\n\\nspecifically for commercial property owners. 87 N.J. at 149. In Stewart, the\\n\\nplaintiff left the defendant’s tavern, walked a short distance, and fell on the\\n\\nsidewalk abutting an adjacent vacant lot, which the defendant also owned. Id.\\n\\nat 149-50. The plaintiff suffered injuries in the fall, which he alleged were\\n\\ncaused by the sidewalk’s seriously dilapidated condition. Id. at 150. In\\n\\nconcluding that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty, the Court overruled\\n\\nYanhko and held that “commercial landowners are responsible for maintaining\\n\\nin reasonably good condition the sidewalks abutting their property and are\\n\\nliable to pedestrians injured as a result of their negligent failure to do so.” Id.\\n\\nat 149, 157.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        14\\n       The Court characterized the previous “no liability” rule as\\n\\n“anachronistic” and as “produc[ing] harsh and unfair results.” Id. at 150.\\n\\nCiting Justice Proctor’s dissenting opinion in Murray, the Court reasoned that\\n\\nthe old rule had become incompatible with modern-day uses of streets and\\n\\nsidewalks, 2 and it therefore modified the rule both to provide innocent injured\\n\\nparties with legal recourse and to incentivize abutting commercial property\\n\\nowners to keep their sidewalks in reasonably good condition. Id. at 155. The\\n\\nCourt explained:\\n\\n            This new rule responds to many of the weaknesses of\\n            the no liability rule. It will provide a remedy to many\\n            innocent plaintiffs for injuries caused by improper\\n            maintenance of sidewalks. As a corollary, it will give\\n            owners of abutting commercial property an incentive to\\n            keep their sidewalks in proper repair, a duty already\\n            created in many cases by municipal ordinances. It will\\n            also eliminate much of the arbitrariness of the old rule.\\n            In addition, injured persons will be able to recover for\\n            injuries sustained just outside a store as well as those\\n            sustained within it.\\n\\n            [Id. at 157-58.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  The Court noted that municipalities have not been solely responsible for\\nsidewalk maintenance “for many years” because many imposed a duty on\\nproperty owners through ordinances under N.J.S.A. 40:65-14, which authorizes\\nmunicipalities to make it “the duty of any owner of abutting lands . . . to\\nconstruct, repair, alter or relay any curb or sidewalk, or section thereof.”\\nStewart, 87 N.J. at 155.\\n                                         15\\n       The Court concluded that imposing this duty on commercial property\\n\\nowners was fair because they retain substantial interests in abutting sidewalks,\\n\\nwhich provide “easy access to [and from] their premises and increase the value\\n\\nof their property.” Id. at 151-52, 158. Moreover, the Court determined that\\n\\nowners of abutting property are in “an ideal position to inspect sidewalks and\\n\\nto take prompt action to cure defects.” Id. at 158.\\n\\n      Mindful of the significant impact its decision would have on property\\n\\nowners, the Court expressly limited imposing the duty to maintain abutting\\n\\nsidewalks to commercial -- not residential -- properties. Id. at 159. 3 Notably,\\n\\nthe Court found it “particularly compelling” to impose this duty on “abutting\\n\\ncommercial property owners.” Ibid.\\n\\n      Stewart instructed courts to determine which properties the new rule\\n\\nwould cover by following “commonly accepted definitions of ‘commercial’\\n\\nand ‘residential’ property . . . , with difficult cases to be decided as they arise.”\\n\\nId. at 160. Recognizing that the new rule would impose an expense on\\n\\ncommercial property owners, the Court noted that it anticipated liability\\n\\ninsurance would become available, the cost of which owners would absorb as a\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  The Stewart Court “[did] not reach the question of whether the same duty\\nshould be imposed on owners of residential property or whether the policy\\nconsiderations underlying the impositions of a duty on commercial property\\nowners apply to residential property owners.” 87 N.J. at 159 n.6.\\n                                      16\\n necessary expense of doing business. Ibid. The Court strongly urged\\n\\nlegislative action, pointing out that “the law of sidewalk liability is an\\n\\nappropriate subject for reconsideration by the Legislature.” Id. at 159 n.6.\\n\\nThe Legislature, however, did not act.\\n\\n      Two years after Stewart, this Court extended the newly adopted duty to\\n\\n“include[] removal or reduction of the hazard of snow and ice dependent upon\\n\\nthe standard of care of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.”\\n\\nMirza v. Filmore Corp., 92 N.J. 390, 400 (1983); see Pareja v. Princeton Int’l\\n\\nProps., 246 N.J. 546, 558 (2021) (clarifying that Mirza’s rule applies only after\\n\\nthe storm that created the dangerous condition has concluded); see also\\n\\nAntenucci v. Mr. Nick’s Mens Sportswear, 212 N.J. Super. 124, 128-30 (App.\\n\\nDiv. 1986) (extending the Stewart rule to a commercial tenant who is in\\n\\nexclusive possession of the premises abutting the sidewalk); Vasquez v.\\n\\nMansol Realty Assocs., Inc., 280 N.J. Super. 234, 237-38 (App. Div. 1995)\\n\\n(imposing liability on a commercial property owner whose commercial tenant\\n\\nnegligently failed to remove ice or snow as contractually obligated).\\n\\n      In 1988, we grappled with the difficult commercial-residential\\n\\ndistinction that Stewart foreshadowed in a case involving a plaintiff who\\n\\nslipped on ice in front of a nonprofit private religious school. Brown v. St.\\n\\nVenantius Sch., 111 N.J. 325, 326 (1988). As a threshold matter, the Court\\n\\n                                         17\\n recognized that the defendant parochial school was not a residential property\\n\\nbecause no one resided in the school and explained that the school’s religious\\n\\nnature was not dispositive because the inquiry in the case of religious,\\n\\ncharitable, or nonprofit owners focuses on the “use of the abutting land, not the\\n\\nnature of the organization that owns the property.” Id. at 332-33. 4 This Court\\n\\nultimately decided that treating the school as “commercial” for sidewalk\\n\\nliability purposes was appropriate because requiring it to clear the abutting\\n\\nsidewalks was not an overly onerous burden, and it was fairer to allocate the\\n\\nrisk of loss on the school rather than on an innocent pedestrian. Id. at 334-35.\\n\\nThus, we held that the Stewart rule applied to the parochial school. Id. at 338.\\n\\n                                       3.\\n\\n      Given the Stewart Court’s instruction to trial courts to determine which\\n\\nproperties the new rule would cover by following “commonly accepted\\n\\ndefinitions of ‘commercial’ and ‘residential,’” 87 N.J. at 160, and its comment\\n\\nthat apartment buildings should be considered commercial property and\\n\\ncovered by the new rule, id. at 160 n.7, the Appellate Division has frequently\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  Courts typically address the nature of the property’s ownership to determine\\nwhether a property is commercial or residential. Dupree v. City of Clifton,\\n351 N.J. Super. 237, 242 (App. Div. 2002), aff’d, 175 N.J. 449 (2003). For\\ninstance, if the property is owned for “investment or business purposes,” the\\nproperty is often deemed commercial. Mohamed v. Iglesia Evangelica Oasis\\nDe Salvacion, 424 N.J. Super. 489, 493 (App. Div. 2012).\\n                                        18\\n probed the gray area of whether mixed-use “residential” property has been\\n\\nconverted into “commercial” for sidewalk liability purposes by analyzing the\\n\\nvarious uses of properties at issue, see Grijalba v. Floro, 431 N.J. Super. 57, 62\\n\\n(App. Div. 2013) (“[W]e have employed a case-by-case, fact-sensitive analysis\\n\\nto resolve the commercial-residential distinction.”) (footnote omitted). Our\\n\\nassessment of those Appellate Division cases reveals that “central to the\\n\\nAppellate Division’s inquiry in such matters has been whether a property’s\\n\\npredominant use has the capacity to generate income, regardless of whether an\\n\\nactual profit is obtained through the use.” Luchejko v. City of Hoboken, 207\\n\\nN.J. 191, 206 (2011). Although we review those cases as part of the premises\\n\\nliability jurisprudence in our courts, we “need not address the universe of\\n\\n[those] appellate decisions, [given] their fine distinctions.” Ibid.\\n\\n      Several Appellate Division cases, however, are particularly relevant to\\n\\nour discussion here because they reflect the lack of clarity in our courts’\\n\\njurisprudence regarding commercial sidewalk liability law. As such, we\\n\\nbriefly address them in turn.\\n\\n      Nearly 15 years after Stewart, the Appellate Division decided Abraham,\\n\\non which defendants and amicus heavily rely. There, the plaintiff slipped and\\n\\nfell on snow that had accumulated on a sidewalk abutting the defendant’s\\n\\nvacant lot, which was zoned for commercial use. 281 N.J. Super. at 82. The\\n\\n                                        19\\n lot was neither adjacent to nor used in conjunction with any enterprise or\\n\\nbusiness the defendant owned or controlled. Ibid. The plaintiff claimed that\\n\\nthe defendant was negligent in failing to properly maintain the sidewalk by not\\n\\nremoving the ice and snow. Ibid.\\n\\n      In holding that the defendant did not owe a duty to the plaintiff, the\\n\\nAppellate Division distinguished Stewart which imposed a duty because the\\n\\ninjury in that case occurred on a sidewalk abutting a vacant lot which was\\n\\nadjacent to and supported the defendant’s bar, making it “an integral part of a\\n\\ncommercial enterprise.” Id. at 83. The court further explained that Stewart\\n\\nconfined the duty to commercial enterprises or businesses, “but not upon the\\n\\nowners of vacant lots which are not utilized as part of such an enterprise or\\n\\nbusiness.” Ibid. In reaching that conclusion, the court gleaned from Stewart\\n\\nand its progeny an “unexpressed, but nevertheless intended limitation to its\\n\\nrule: liability is imposed upon the owner of a profit, or not-for-profit\\n\\nenterprise, regardless of whether the enterprise is in fact profitable.” Id. at 85.\\n\\nThe court limited Stewart’s application to commercial properties with the\\n\\n“capacity to generate income,” finding that qualification to be “the key.” Ibid.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division identified two policy considerations in Stewart\\n\\nthat justified imposing commercial liability: (1) commercial property owners\\n\\nderive benefits from public sidewalks providing safe and convenient access to\\n\\n                                        20\\n and from their businesses; and (2) commercial enterprises have “the capacity\\n\\nto spread the risk of loss arising from injuries on abutting sidewalks, either\\n\\nthrough the purchase of commercial liability policies or ‘through higher\\n\\ncharges for the commercial enterprise’s goods and services.’” Ibid. (quoting\\n\\nMirza, 92 N.J. at 397). Applying those principles, the court concluded that\\n\\nStewart liability did not attach to the defendant’s vacant commercial lot\\n\\nbecause it was “not owned by or used as part of a contiguous commercial\\n\\nenterprise or business”; it did not entertain daily business activity making safe\\n\\nand convenient access essential; and it lacked the capacity to generate income\\n\\nto purchase liability insurance or to spread the risk of loss onto customers.\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n        Defendant and amicus also rely on Gray, which reaffirmed but\\n\\ndistinguished Abraham. 425 N.J. Super. at 501. In Gray, the defendant\\n\\ncompany owned a vacant commercial building with boarded windows, locked\\n\\ndoors, and an iron gate. Id. at 498. The building was not connected to\\n\\nelectricity but had been leased as a retail store five years prior. Ibid. The\\n\\ndefendant marketed the property for sale, maintained a commercial insurance\\n\\npolicy on the building, and permitted prospective buyers to enter and inspect\\n\\nthe premises. Ibid. The plaintiff slipped and fell on the sidewalk in front of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        21\\n the defendant’s vacant commercial building, which had not been cleared of\\n\\nsnow or ice. Id. at 503.\\n\\n      In concluding that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff under\\n\\nStewart, the court adopted Abraham’s emphasis on income potential, finding\\n\\nthat -- unlike the vacant lot in that case -- “[t]his building had the capacity to\\n\\ngenerate income.” Id. at 501. Just as the Abraham court considered the\\n\\nproperty’s status as a vacant lot, the Gray court highlighted that “[t]he property\\n\\nhere is not a vacant lot but a commercial building.” Ibid. The court explained\\n\\nthat the building generated income in the recent past and could have been used\\n\\nto generate income again as a retail store; the defendant, however, chose to\\n\\nmarket it for sale. Ibid. Moreover, the court found that the defendant was\\n\\nliable under Stewart because it made the property accessible to potential\\n\\nbuyers (thereby assuming a duty to keep it safe for its invitees), maintained\\n\\nliability insurance on the property, and sold it to make money. Id. at 501-02.\\n\\n                                         4.\\n\\n      Subsequent cases continued to rely on, qualify, or distinguish Stewart,\\n\\nAbraham, and Gray, somewhat confounding our commercial sidewalk liability\\n\\nlaw. To illustrate, in Nielsen v. Wal-Mart Store No. 2171, the Appellate\\n\\nDivision stated in a footnote that what distinguished the properties in Abraham\\n\\nand Gray was their differing “potential to generate income,” making no\\n\\n                                         22\\n mention of whether the properties contained structures or were vacant lots.\\n\\n429 N.J. Super. 251, 258 n.4 (App. Div. 2013) (“We distinguished Abraham v.\\n\\nGupta . . . , which held that no duty could be imposed on an owner of vacant\\n\\nproperty for the condition of abutting sidewalks, because in Gray the building\\n\\nhad the potential to generate income.”).\\n\\n      And recently, in Ellis v. Hilton United Methodist Church, the Appellate\\n\\nDivision focused on whether the vacant church was a “commercial building,”\\n\\nholding that “[h]ere, defendants’ church is not a commercial building,” so the\\n\\ndefendants had no duty to maintain the abutting sidewalk. 455 N.J. Super. 33,\\n\\n40 (App. Div. 2018). The court reasoned that the defendants were not liable\\n\\nfor the plaintiff’s fall in that case because the defendants never used the church\\n\\nfor commercial purposes and it was not open to the public in any capacity once\\n\\nit stopped functioning as a church, despite defendants’ maintaining liability\\n\\ninsurance on the property. Ibid. The court declined to impose liability simply\\n\\nbecause the defendants’ property “could have been put to use to generate\\n\\nincome,” reasoning that doing so would go beyond Stewart’s intended reach\\n\\nand subject “any noncommercial or residential property . . . to sidewalk\\n\\nliability immediately upon it being vacated or abandoned because it had the\\n\\npotential to be converted to a commercial use.” Ibid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       23\\n                                          B.\\n\\n      In light of those legal principles and our courts’ jurisprudence in this\\n\\narea, we now turn to the issue before this Court.\\n\\n      For over four decades since Stewart, our courts have adhered to the rule\\n\\nimposing liability on commercial landowners. We are now tasked with\\n\\ndetermining whether that same liability should apply to commercial\\n\\nlandowners of vacant lots. As this Court noted in Hopkins, “‘[w]hether a duty\\n\\nexists is ultimately a question of fairness.’” 132 N.J. at 439 (quoting\\n\\nWeinberg, 106 N.J. at 485). That guiding principle leads us to conclude that a\\n\\nduty should be imposed on owners of vacant commercial lots to maintain the\\n\\nabutting sidewalks in reasonably good condition. There is something\\n\\nprofoundly unfair about commercial property owners purchasing vacant lots\\n\\nand having no responsibility whatsoever for maintaining the area where the\\n\\ngeneral public traverses. We therefore hold that all commercial landowners --\\n\\nincluding owners of vacant commercial lots -- must maintain the public\\n\\nsidewalks abutting their property in reasonably good condition and can be held\\n\\nliable to pedestrians injured as a result of their negligent failure to do so.\\n\\n      The moment an individual or an entity purchases a lot in a commercially\\n\\nzoned area, meaning the only use to which that land can be put is commercial,\\n\\nthe purchaser has begun a commercial endeavor and intends to make money.\\n\\n                                         24\\n The Stewart Court instructed courts to determine which properties the then-\\n\\nnew rule would cover by following “commonly accepted definitions of\\n\\n‘commercial’ and ‘residential.’” 87 N.J. at 160. “Commercial” is defined as\\n\\n“[o]f, relating to, or involving the ability of a product or business to make a\\n\\nprofit,” Black’s Law Dictionary 336 (11th ed. 2019), and “for making a profit\\n\\nor relating to making a profit,” Cambridge Dictionary, https://dictionary.\\n\\ncambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/commercial (last visited April 23, 2024).\\n\\nAs such, the predominant, if not sole purpose of a property in a commercially\\n\\nzoned area is to make a profit off that land.\\n\\n      By its essence, a commercial lot exists and is bought and sold for the\\n\\npurpose of making money. Defendant Young Il An admitted as much during\\n\\nhis deposition. Defendant stated that he purchased the subject lot intending to\\n\\nbuild a commercial structure on it and make money. Defendant further opined\\n\\nthat “[i]f anybody does not think of [buying commercial property] in that way,\\n\\nnobody should really purchase anything,” in discussing one of the other vacant\\n\\nlots he maintained in Camden for decades. Indeed, when someone purchases a\\n\\nvacant commercial lot, that is a business decision that embraces all the\\n\\nattendant costs and burdens of conducting business. We conclude that one of\\n\\nthose costs necessarily includes maintaining the abutting sidewalks so that\\n\\nthey are in a reasonably safe condition for innocent passersby.\\n\\n                                        25\\n       Defense counsel suggests that we adopt a case-by-case, fact-sensitive\\n\\napproach to determine when a commercial landowner owes a duty. Such an\\n\\nanalysis could seemingly trigger a duty based on nebulous indicators ranging\\n\\nfrom when a brick-and-mortar business receives permits to begin construction,\\n\\nto when it opens its doors to the public, to when that business turns a profit.\\n\\nCounsel also suggested at oral argument that such a rule could focus on an\\n\\n“immediate path to profit” or “something so close to an active business that\\n\\n[is] about to open.” Understandably, counsel could neither define those terms\\n\\nnor provide a practical framework for courts dealing with wide-ranging factual\\n\\nscenarios to determine how to apply them in the real world.\\n\\n      Trying to determine whether a business entity is profitable would be a\\n\\ndifficult task indeed. It is common knowledge that many new businesses, in\\n\\nvarying areas of commerce, take time to become profitable and often do not\\n\\nturn a profit for a year or more after officially opening for business, if the\\n\\nbusiness survives at all. See, e.g., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Longevity,\\n\\nhttps://www.jpmorganchase.com/institute/research/small-business/small-\\n\\nbusiness-dashboard/longevity (last visited April 22, 2024) (“Roughly a third of\\n\\nnew businesses exit within their first two years, and half exit within their first\\n\\nfive years.”).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        26\\n       If profitability is the test, business entities that have not technically\\n\\nbecome profitable despite being open for business apparently would not owe a\\n\\nduty. And it seems our courts, in deciding whether a duty is owed, would be\\n\\nrequired to inspect the financial books of commercial entities to determine\\n\\nwhether they are in the black or the red.\\n\\n      Given the broad implications of our tort liability decisions, we must\\n\\nadopt a sensible rule to appropriately resolve this specific case and govern\\n\\nfuture conduct. See Hopkins, 132 N.J. at 439. And profitability is challenging\\n\\nto calculate for new businesses even to determine contract-based claims, which\\n\\nrequire more business-related evidentiary showings than a sidewalk liability\\n\\ncase. See Schwartz v. Menas, 251 N.J. 556, 576-77 (2022) (noting that lost\\n\\nprofits for a new business are difficult to prove with reasonable certainty but\\n\\ndeclining to ban lost-profit damages for new businesses); Kenneth M. Kolaski\\n\\n& Mark Kuga, Measuring Commercial Damages Via Lost Profits or Loss of\\n\\nBusiness Value: Are These Measures Redundant or Distinguishable?, 18 J.L.\\n\\n& Com. 1, 8-9 (1998) (“Unestablished businesses are those businesses which\\n\\nare not yet profitable or have not yet established an operating track record\\n\\nfrom which to confidently and reliably project future operating performance.\\n\\nThese young businesses may require the use of more assumptions and reliance\\n\\non fewer pieces of documented data and information in preparing a damage\\n\\n                                         27\\n calculation than would be required for an ‘established’ or ‘mature’ business.”).\\n\\nAccordingly, we find the suggestion to base liability on profitability or a path\\n\\nto profitability to be an unworkable approach that will only further confuse our\\n\\ncommercial sidewalk liability law, lead to inconsistent results, and unfairly\\n\\nharm the public.\\n\\n      A bright-line rule that commercial property owners owe a duty, as first\\n\\npronounced in Stewart, is the most workable rule to protect the general public\\n\\nand ensure consistency in our courts. In Abraham, Gray, and Ellis, the\\n\\nAppellate Division distinguished among different types of commercial\\n\\nproperties in determining whether certain characteristics of commercial\\n\\nproperty should result in liability. Abraham, which involved a vacant lot,\\n\\ninterpreted Stewart’s holding to apply to commercial properties with the\\n\\n“capacity to generate income,” which the appellate court held was not the case\\n\\nwith the vacant lot in question. 281 N.J. Super. at 85. But in Gray, the\\n\\nAppellate Division concluded that the defendant commercial lot owner owed a\\n\\nduty to the plaintiff because the property had a capacity to generate income\\n\\neven though the building on the lot was vacant with boarded up windows and\\n\\nno electricity. 425 N.J. Super. at 498, 501. Some could argue that the vacant\\n\\nlot in Abraham had as much income-generating potential as the vacant\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       28\\n building because vacant lots can function to house a variety of commercial\\n\\nenterprises such as a parking lot, a farmers’ market, or billboard advertising. 5\\n\\n      These cases illustrate the difficulty of employing a case-by-case,\\n\\ncommercial-property-by-commercial-property approach to determining when a\\n\\nduty is owed. “Fairness requires that one be able to ascertain what one’s duty\\n\\nis and how it can be performed.” Hopkins, 132 N.J. at 454 (Garibaldi, J.,\\n\\ndissenting) (arguing that “the nebulous standards set by the majority . . .\\n\\nprovide no guidelines” and the opinion “raises more questions than it answers”\\n\\nregarding the duty owed).\\n\\n      In our view, it matters not that there is no structure or active business\\n\\nbeing conducted on a commercial property. Certainly, Stewart’s language four\\n\\ndecades ago noted the profit-making aspect of owning commercial property\\n\\nand the capacity to absorb the costs of liability insurance or, alternatively, to\\n\\nraise prices on customers. 87 N.J. at 160; see Mirza, 92 N.J. at 397 (“Further,\\n\\nthe goal of spreading the risk of loss would probably be served either through\\n\\n\\n5\\n  Furthermore, as amicus suggested, it is common practice for property owners\\nto hold vacant lots for investment purposes -- presumably for their profit-\\nmaking potential -- without intending to develop the lots themselves.\\nAlthough defendants here ultimately decided not to build a structure on the\\nsubject lot, that does not mean the lot lacked profit-making potential. The\\nrecord indicates that defendants have owned the subject lot for more than three\\ndecades. During that thirty-year period, under Gray’s rationale, defendants\\ncould have used the lot to make money in various ways.\\n\\n                                        29\\n the increase of future insurance policy premiums, or, if the commercial\\n\\nproperty owner has no insurance, through higher charges for the commercial\\n\\nenterprise’s goods or services.”). Purchasing insurance and absorbing the cost\\n\\nof insurance was noted in Stewart as a means to spread the risk of loss. See 87\\n\\nN.J. at 160. But again, an individual purchasing commercial land to make\\n\\nmoney has already decided to enter a business venture, so it is not\\n\\nunreasonable or unfair for such an individual to have to factor liability\\n\\ninsurance into the cost of embarking on the journey of their commercial\\n\\nendeavor.\\n\\n      Stewart, however, assumed a brick-and-mortar business on the property\\n\\nwas a necessary component of commercial enterprise, and with good reason.\\n\\nSee 87 N.J. at 152 (“Public use of commercial establishments is facilitated by\\n\\nthe existence of sidewalks.”); id. at 158 (“In addition, injured persons will be\\n\\nable to recover for injuries sustained just outside a store as well as those\\n\\nsustained within it.”). When the Court decided Stewart in 1981, the operation\\n\\nof a business or commercial enterprise necessarily involved the use and\\n\\nmaintenance of brick-and-mortar physical premises, which is not always the\\n\\ncase today. But Stewart’s basic principle -- “the right of the public to safe and\\n\\nunimpeded passage along the sidewalk” must continue to prevail. See ibid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        30\\n       Stewart did not expressly distinguish between certain types of\\n\\ncommercial properties or commercial properties with active businesses on\\n\\nthem; rather, the Court distinguished only between commercial and residential\\n\\nproperties. Id. at 160. We find it instructive that the Court referred throughout\\n\\nits opinion to “commercial landowners,” id. at 157, “owners of abutting\\n\\ncommercial property,” ibid., and “abutting commercial property owners,” id. at\\n\\n150, 154, 159. The Court imposed the duty to maintain abutting sidewalks in\\n\\nreasonably good condition on “owners of commercial property.” Id. at 159.\\n\\n      We therefore conclude that the sidewalk liability distinction should be\\n\\nbetween commercial and residential properties, not among certain types of\\n\\ncommercial properties, or commercial properties with buildings, or\\n\\ncommercial properties with active, potentially profitable entities on them.\\n\\nThis is the distinction from Stewart. Moreover, the bright-line rule we\\n\\narticulate today -- that all commercial property owners owe a duty to maintain\\n\\nabutting sidewalks in reasonably good condition -- will ensure fairness,\\n\\nconsistency, and predictability in our courts going forward. As noted in\\n\\nStewart, the “standard of care, after all, will be reasonableness.” Id. at 158.\\n\\nThus, imposing this duty on owners of vacant commercial lots would not be\\n\\n“onerous,” as defendants and amicus suggest. Nor would this ruling create “an\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        31\\n entirely new field of liability with respect to sidewalks, but . . . merely add[] to\\n\\nduties of abutting owners that already exist.” Id. at 159.\\n\\n      Importantly, this rule will clarify the scope of commercial sidewalk\\n\\nliability and provide clear guidance to courts, commercial property owners,\\n\\nand the public. This rule furthers Stewart’s “cardinal principle” to ensure the\\n\\npublic’s right “to safe and unimpeded passage along the sidewalk.” Id. at 152;\\n\\nMirza, 92 N.J. at 397.\\n\\n      In line with notions of public policy and judicial fairness, plaintiff will\\n\\nreceive the benefit of the rule we announce today. See Fischer v. Canario, 143\\n\\nN.J. 235, 246 (1996) (“[A]s a matter of public policy, to encourage litigants to\\n\\nchallenge common law doctrines, courts often apply the new rule only to\\n\\nfuture cases and to the litigants whose efforts forged the development of the\\n\\nnew legal rule.”). To the extent that Abraham conflicts with our decision, it is\\n\\nhereby overruled.\\n\\n      Over forty years ago, this Court urged the Legislature to address the\\n\\nissue of commercial sidewalk liability. See Stewart, 87 N.J. at 159 n.6 (“We\\n\\nnote . . . that the law of sidewalk liability is an appropriate subject for\\n\\nreconsideration by the Legislature.”). We once again implore the Legislature\\n\\nto do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         32\\n                                        V.\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment\\n\\nand remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with\\n\\nthe rule we adopt today.\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES FASCIALE and NORIEGA join\\nin JUSTICE PIERRE-LOUIS’s opinion.

Apart from its commercial zoning -- which, under Abraham v. Gupta,\\n\\n281 N.J. Super. 81 (App. Div. 1995), is an insufficient basis to impose liability\\n\\n-- defendants’ property has no characteristics of an income-generating\\n\\nproperty. The decisions in Stewart, Abraham, and Gray held that owners of\\n\\ncommercial property with a capacity to generate income have a duty to\\n\\nmaintain sidewalks abutting their property, and that failure to do so may give\\n\\nrise to liability in tort. Stewart v. 104 Wallace St., Inc., 87 N.J. 146, 157-60\\n\\n(1981); Abraham, 281 N.J. Super. 83-86; Gray v. Caldwell Wood Prods., Inc.,\\n\\n425 N.J. Super. 496, 501-03 (App. Div. 2012).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         1\\n       The majority, purportedly relying on principles of fairness, now imposes\\n\\nliability on the owner of a non-revenue-generating lot, thereby placing the\\n\\nburden on a commercial property owner who has no means to address the\\n\\nresulting costs. That liability devalues defendants’ property, resulting in\\n\\nfurther devaluation of surrounding properties. The majority’s decision does\\n\\nnot promote fairness; rather, the decision promotes unfairness to residents and\\n\\nbusinesses who have chosen to invest in Camden’s future.\\n\\n      The majority’s expansion of liability in this setting expropriates a\\n\\ndecision that this Court in Stewart correctly stated rests with the Legislature\\n\\nelected by the citizens of New Jersey to set policy. I therefore dissent.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n      Historically, New Jersey followed the common law rule that the\\n\\ngovernment bore “the primary responsibility for the maintenance of the\\n\\nsidewalks.” Stewart, 87 N.J. at 154. In 1970, the Legislature enacted N.J.S.A.\\n\\n40:65-14, which expressly states that “[a]ny municipality may prescribe by\\n\\ngeneral ordinance in what case curbs and sidewalks shall be constructed,\\n\\nrepaired, altered, relaid or maintained at the expense of the abutting\\n\\nlandowners.” 1\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  N.J.S.A. 40:65-14 could have, but does not, authorize a private right of\\naction by injured pedestrians against abutting property owners. Instead, if a\\n                                        2\\n       A decade later, relying in part on N.J.S.A. 40:65-14, this Court held that\\n\\n“commercial landowners are responsible for maintaining in reasonably good\\n\\ncondition the sidewalks abutting their property and are liable to pedestrians\\n\\ninjured as a result of their negligent failure to do so.” Id. at 157. We\\n\\nexplained that the common law rule -- which imposed liability on\\n\\ngovernments, not individual property owners -- was “derived from conditions\\n\\nthat no longer exist and [wa]s not responsive to” modern-day use of sidewalks,\\n\\nid. at 155, which instead supported imposing liability on the owners of\\n\\nbusinesses that benefited from the sidewalks, see id. at 159 (“[A]lthough the\\n\\npaved sidewalks fronting a commercial establishment are primarily for the use\\n\\nof the public generally, their condition is so beneficially related to the\\n\\noperation of the business that the unrestricted legal duty of maintaining them\\n\\nin good repair might, arguably, be placed on it.” (quoting Krug v. Wanner, 28\\n\\nN.J. 174, 180 (1958))). We specifically relied on the “obvious arbitrariness of\\n\\nthe fact that in accidents occurring within the boundaries of business premises,\\n\\na plaintiff injured as a consequence of [a] defendant’s failure to maintain safe\\n\\npremises would have a cause of action, whereas” no cause of action would be\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nproperty owner fails to maintain sidewalks abutting property, the municipality\\nmay rectify the issue and charge the property owner for the cost of the repair.\\nN.J.S.A. 40:65-14.\\n                                       3\\n available to “the same plaintiff injured on a poorly maintained public sidewalk\\n\\njust outside the premises.” Id. at 156-57.\\n\\n      We thus found that imposing the duty to maintain sidewalks on\\n\\ncommercial property owners was reasonable because “sidewalks provide\\n\\ncommercial owners with easy access to their premises and increase the value\\n\\nof their property,” such that “[p]ublic use of commercial establishments is\\n\\nfacilitated by the existence of sidewalks.” Id. at 152; see also id. at 159\\n\\n(stressing that “[t]he duty to maintain abutting sidewalks that we impose today\\n\\nis confined to owners of commercial property”). We believed that imposing\\n\\nthe duty to maintain sidewalks on commercial property owners would “give\\n\\nowners of abutting commercial property an incentive to keep their sidewalks in\\n\\nproper repair, a duty already created in many cases by municipal ordinances,”\\n\\nespecially because commercial property owners are in “an ideal position to\\n\\ninspect sidewalks and to take prompt action to cure defects.” Id. at 157-58.\\n\\n      However, we explicitly stated that “the law of sidewalk liability is an\\n\\nappropriate subject for reconsideration by the Legislature.” Id. at 159 n.6\\n\\n(emphasis added).\\n\\n      In Abraham, the Appellate Division further explained Stewart’s rule:\\n\\ncommercial property owners with the “capacity to generate income” have a\\n\\nduty to maintain the sidewalks that abut their property. 281 N.J. Super. at 85.\\n\\n                                        4\\n In that case, the plaintiff slipped and fell on a sidewalk abutting the\\n\\ndefendants’ vacant lot. Id. at 82. Although the lot was zoned for commercial\\n\\nuse, the Abraham court highlighted that the lot was “not adjacent to or used in\\n\\nconjunction with any enterprise or business owned or controlled by [the]\\n\\ndefendant.” Ibid. In declining to impose liability on the defendant, the court\\n\\nexplained that Stewart imposed liability for damages because the plaintiff fell\\n\\non a sidewalk that abutted a vacant lot adjacent to the commercial property,\\n\\nwhich “suggest[s] that liability was imposed because the abutting sidewalk\\n\\nwhere the fall occurred was an integral part of a commercial enterprise.” Id. at\\n\\n83 (citing Stewart, 87 N.J. at 150). The Abraham court reasoned that Stewart’s\\n\\nanalysis “underscores an important policy underpinning to its holding: the\\n\\nbenefits enjoyed by the ‘commercial establishment’ by use of abutting\\n\\nsidewalks for ingress and egress purposes should impose a concomitant duty to\\n\\nkeep those means of ingress and egress in reasonably good repair.” Id. at 84.\\n\\nAs the Abraham court explained, Stewart’s analysis implied that a duty of care\\n\\nis confined to commercial enterprises or businesses, “but not upon the owners\\n\\nof vacant lots which are not utilized as part of such an enterprise or business.”\\n\\nId. at 83.\\n\\n      According to Abraham, “our courts have focused on a second policy\\n\\nconsideration” stemming from Stewart and its progeny: “the commercial\\n\\n                                         5\\n enterprise’s capacity to spread the risk of loss.” Ibid. The Abraham court\\n\\nconcluded that the presence of “an unexpressed, but nevertheless intended\\n\\nlimitation to its rule . . . the capacity to generate income . . . is the key.” Id. at\\n\\n85 (emphases added). The court explained further that “liability is imposed\\n\\nbecause of the benefits the entrepreneur derives from providing a safe and\\n\\nconvenient access for its patrons” and because commercial establishments\\n\\n“ha[ve] the capacity to spread the risk of loss arising from injuries on abutting\\n\\nsidewalks, either through the purchase of commercial liability policies or\\n\\n‘through higher charges for the commercial enterprise’s goods and services.’”\\n\\nIbid. (quoting Mirza v. Filmore Corp., 92 N.J. 390, 397 (1983)).\\n\\n      Applying that rule, the Abraham court found that policy considerations\\n\\nderived from Stewart were inapplicable because the lot in question was “not\\n\\nowned by or used as part of a contiguous commercial enterprise or business,”\\n\\nnor was there daily business activity on the lot that would require access by\\n\\npatrons. Ibid. Importantly, the Abraham court determined that “[t]he lot has\\n\\nno means of generating income to purchase liability insurance or to spread the\\n\\nrisk of loss by the increase in cost of goods sold or services rendered.” Ibid.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Abraham court expressly concluded that “[s]imply because it\\n\\nis designated ‘commercial’ by the City’s zoning ordinance is an insufficient\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          6\\n basis to impose the Stewart liability rule upon its owner.” Id. at 85-86\\n\\n(emphasis added).\\n\\n      Seventeen years later, the principles of Stewart and Abraham were\\n\\napplied in Gray, in which the plaintiff was injured “when she slipped and fell\\n\\non an ice and snow covered sidewalk in front of [the] defendant’s commercial\\n\\nbuilding.” 425 N.J. Super. at 498. At the time, “the building was vacant and\\n\\nhad been since the prior tenant vacated” over one year earlier. Ibid. “The\\n\\nbuilding had no electricity and was secured with boarded windows, locked\\n\\ndoors and an iron gate.” Ibid. The parties did not dispute that the property\\n\\nwas commercial, given that “during defendant’s ownership, the property had\\n\\nbeen leased as a retail store, was being marketed for sale as a commercial\\n\\nproperty, and prospective buyers were permitted entry to inspect the premises.”\\n\\nIbid. In addition, the defendant “maintained a commercial insurance policy on\\n\\nthe building.” Ibid.\\n\\n      The defendant “argued that there was no legal basis for sidewalk liability\\n\\nbecause the property was vacant and no business operations or activities were\\n\\nbeing conducted at the property at the time of the accident.” Id. at 498-99.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs countered by arguing “facts to support the imposition of\\n\\nsidewalk liability,” including “the property’s potential to generate income; the\\n\\nactive marketing of the property at the time of the accident; the eventual sale\\n\\n                                        7\\n of the property two months after the accident; and the owner’s ability to spread\\n\\nthe risk, as evidenced by the commercial insurance coverage on the property.”\\n\\nThe trial court, likening the commercial property in Gray to the one in\\n\\nAbraham, granted summary judgment. Ibid. The Appellate Division reversed.\\n\\nId. at 503.\\n\\n      Distinguishing Abraham, the Gray court reasoned that the property at\\n\\nissue was “not a vacant lot but a commercial building” that “had the capacity\\n\\nto generate income and, had, in fact, generated income in the recent past.” Id.\\n\\nat 501. The court explained that the commercial property could have been\\n\\nused as a retail store but that “the owners chose to market the property for\\n\\nsale.” Ibid. In doing so, the defendant “made the property accessible to\\n\\npotential buyers[,] thereby subjecting itself to the duty to keep their property\\n\\nsafe for their invitees.” Ibid. In addition, the court considered that the\\n\\n“[d]efendant maintained property insurance, presumably to protect against\\n\\ninjuries to their invitees.” Id. at 501. Defendant then “sold the property to\\n\\nmake money.” Id. at 502. The court concluded that the “[d]efendant [was]\\n\\nprecisely the type of commercial property owner upon whom it is appropriate\\n\\nto impose liability.” Ibid.\\n\\n      Since 1981, the rule in Stewart has been developed, first by Abraham in\\n\\n1995, and then by Gray in 2012. The meaning of the well-reasoned and\\n\\n                                        8\\n consistent decisions of Stewart, Abraham, and Gray is clear: commercial\\n\\nproperty owners with a capacity to generate income are liable for injuries\\n\\ncaused by their failure to maintain their adjacent sidewalks. E.g., Stewart, 87\\n\\nN.J. at 157-60; Abraham, 281 N.J. Super. 83-86; Gray, 425 N.J. Super. at 501-\\n\\n03.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n      Although we have not explicitly defined the meaning of “generates\\n\\nincome” in this context, this Court and the Appellate Division have developed\\n\\na common thread of factors used to make this determination: whether the\\n\\ncommercial property presently generates income, whether the commercial\\n\\nproperty recently generated income for the same owner (including whether it\\n\\nhas the potential to continue to be used in this same manner), whether the\\n\\ncommercial property will soon generate income, and whether the commercial\\n\\nproperty owner has invited business invitees. See, e.g., Gray, 425 N.J. Super.\\n\\nat 499, 501-02; Abraham, 281 N.J. Super. at 85. 2\\n\\n      Defendants’ vacant commercial property was purchased in 1992, and, for\\n\\nthe last thirty years, has never been used by defendants in any way to generate\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  Applying these factors does not, despite the majority’s assertion, require a\\ncourt to “try[] to determine whether a business entity is profitable”; we agree\\nwith the majority that any such inquiry would be “unworkable.” See ante at\\n___ (slip op. at 25-27).\\n                                        9\\n income. Defendants’ vacant commercial property has not and cannot\\n\\nreasonably be expected to generate income given that defendants are unable to\\n\\nsell the lot, have not invited invitees to enter the lot, have no insurance for the\\n\\nlot, and have no plan to develop the lot.\\n\\n      Apart from the commercial zoning of defendants’ property, which under\\n\\nAbraham is insufficient to impose liability, defendants’ property has no\\n\\ncharacteristics of an income-generating property. Applying the factors courts\\n\\nhave used for decades to determine whether a commercial property has the\\n\\ncapacity to generate income, defendants’ property clearly has no such capacity\\n\\nand no means to defray the costs of possible liability.\\n\\n      I disagree with the majority’s decision to overrule Abraham. The\\n\\nissuance of the majority’s blanket rule -- that sidewalk liability should be\\n\\nbased exclusively on the nature of the property’s zoning -- eliminates the long-\\n\\naccepted distinction that Abraham imposed among commercial property\\n\\nowners. The majority presumes that relying on zoning ordinances to determine\\n\\nthe distinction between commercial and residential properties will promote\\n\\nfairness and add to the rule that already exists, but overruling Abraham\\n\\neviscerates that presumption. By overruling Abraham, the majority ignores\\n\\nprecedent and appropriates the role of the Legislature.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        10\\n       Under the guise of fairness, the majority expands the law to impose upon\\n\\nall owners of commercially zoned property the duty to maintain sidewalks\\n\\nadjacent to their properties and provide liability 3 for damages to those injured\\n\\nwhen they fail to discharge that duty. But the Legislature delegated to elected\\n\\nmunicipal officers, not this Court, the authority to impose on property owners\\n\\nthe duty to maintain sidewalks within the municipality or to provide a private\\n\\ncause of action to recover damages against a property owner for the failure to\\n\\ndo so. N.J.S.A. 40:65-14. That is because municipal officers are better poised\\n\\nto balance the benefits of imposing liability on property owners against the\\n\\ncosts associated with liability, which may deter investment in real estate in a\\n\\nway that conflicts with other legislation designed to encourage and promote\\n\\ndevelopment. Even in Stewart, we called upon the Legislature to resolve any\\n\\nfurther issues regarding sidewalk liability, noting “that the law of sidewalk\\n\\nliability is an appropriate subject for reconsideration by the Legislature.”\\n\\nStewart, 87 N.J. at 159 n.6 (emphasis added). The majority, however,\\n\\ndisregards N.J.S.A. 40:65-14 and prior precedent, and instead chooses to\\n\\nimproperly infringe on legislative authority.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  As we recently and unanimously acknowledged in Goyco v. Progressive\\nInsurance Company, it is the domain of the Legislature to weigh costs and\\nbenefits in the field of insurance. See 257 N.J. 313, 329 (2024).\\n                                        11\\n       Here, Camden chose to act upon the authority delegated to it by the State\\n\\nLegislature pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:65-14 by requiring that sidewalks “be kept\\n\\nin repair by the owner or owners of the abutting property at the cost and\\n\\nexpense of the owner or owners of the lands in front of which any sidewalk is\\n\\nconstructed.” City of Camden Code § 735-5. However, if the property owner\\n\\ndoes not discharge that duty, Camden has chosen not to create a private right of\\n\\naction for injured pedestrians. Instead, the democratically accountable leaders\\n\\nof the City chose to require that “[i]f any owners or persons shall fail to\\n\\nconstruct or repair such sidewalks,” then the government can repair the\\n\\nsidewalk and charge “the cost thereof, with interest” to the property owner.\\n\\nCity of Camden Code § 735-8.\\n\\n      The majority undertakes an expansion of liability that should be decided\\n\\nby the Legislature. Ultimately, the common law exists only by the grace of the\\n\\nLegislature and can be changed by the Legislature at any time. See, e.g., State\\n\\nv. Smith, 85 N.J. 193, 199 (1981) (explaining that the common law is “subject\\n\\nto change by the Legislature”); Mayor & Council of Alpine v. Brewster, 7 N.J.\\n\\n42, 50 (1951) (“There can be no doubt of the power of the lawgiver to classify\\n\\nand define public nuisances, and thus to modify the common-law\\n\\nclassification. Apropos of this, Justice Holmes said: ‘It is settled that, within\\n\\nthe constitutional limits not exactly determined, the Legislature may change\\n\\n                                        12\\n the common law as to nuisances, and may move the line either way, so as to\\n\\nmake things nuisances which were not so, or to make things lawful which were\\n\\nnuisances, although by so doing it affects the use or value of property.’”\\n\\n(quoting Commonwealth v. Parks, 30 N.E. 174, 174 (1892))); LaFage v. Jani,\\n\\n166 N.J. 412, 460 (2001) (LaVecchia, J., concurring in part) (“The Legislature\\n\\nis free to expand, modify, or abrogate common law as it may reasonably\\n\\ndetermine.”); United States v. A & P Trucking Co., 358 U.S. 121, 124 (1958)\\n\\n(“[T]he power of Congress to change the common-law rule is not to be\\n\\ndoubted.”).\\n\\n      Even the majority “implore[s] the Legislature” to act. Ante at ___ (slip\\n\\nop. at 33). We agree that the Legislature should consider the weighty\\n\\nquestions raised by this case. Because the citizens of New Jersey elect\\n\\nlegislators to set policy, the Legislature can weigh competing interests and\\n\\ndetermine which property owners have a duty of care. Similarly, elected\\n\\nbodies have the institutional capacity to hold hearings and conduct data-driven\\n\\nanalyses; they can thus enact statutes that make the kinds of fine distinctions\\n\\nrequired for a consistent, cohesive, and comprehensive approach to liability. 4\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n   See, e.g., N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 7-210 (b) (“Notwithstanding any other\\nprovision of law, the owner of real property abutting any sidewalk, . . . shall be\\nliable for any injury to property or personal injury, including death,\\nproximately caused by the failure of such owner to maintain such sidewalk in a\\n                                        13\\n Courts, on the other hand, reach case-specific determinations based on the\\n\\nlimited number of factual settings that they encounter in appeals and judicial\\n\\ndecisions, which even cumulatively, do not necessarily provide a clear-cut set\\n\\nof rules to guide property owners, courts, and parties. 5 It is the Legislature\\n\\nthat can make the systemic policy determinations necessary for such guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\nreasonably safe condition. Failure to maintain such sidewalk in a reasonably\\nsafe condition shall include, but not be limited to, . . . the negligent failure to\\nremove snow, ice, dirt or other material from the sidewalk.

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n                     State v. Shlawrence Ross (A-34-22) (087823)\\n\\nArgued September 11, 2023 -- Decided March 5, 2024\\n\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n      In this appeal, the Court considers whether the State can obtain physical\\nevidence from a hospital -- a bullet extracted from defendant’s body via surgical\\nprocedure -- pursuant to a search warrant.\\n\\n       On December 3, 2017, defendant Shlawrence Ross allegedly exchanged\\ngunfire with police officers. Officers arrested defendant and transported him to\\nCooper University Hospital to obtain treatment for his gunshot wounds. Defendant\\nwas later indicted for attempted murder and other offenses, and the prosecutor’s\\noffice asked the hospital whether any bullet or metal fragments were removed from\\ndefendant’s body. A hospital employee responded that an X-ray located a bullet in\\ndefendant’s abdomen, but the treating physician did not remove it.\\n\\n       In June 2022, on the advice of counsel, defendant underwent elective surgery\\nto remove that bullet. Defense counsel coordinated with the hospital to have her\\ninvestigator take possession of the bullet after the surgery. Post-surgery, however,\\nthe hospital’s director of security contacted law enforcement regarding the removal\\nof the bullet and did not turn it over to the defense.\\n\\n       The State applied for an ex parte search warrant to obtain from Cooper\\nHospital the bullet and any fragments removed from defendant’s body during the\\nelective surgery. The State also applied for a subpoena seeking all medical records\\nregarding defendant’s treatment and transportation.\\n\\n        The trial court denied the applications, finding that the discovery rules\\nshielded the bullet from the State’s access because the bullet’s existence was the\\nresult of defense counsel’s “conscious litigation choice.” The trial court did not\\nexplain its reasons for denying the subpoena. Concluding that the Fourth\\nAmendment, rather than the Sixth Amendment and reciprocal discovery rules, was\\nthe appropriate legal framework, the Appellate Division reversed and remanded to\\nthe trial court to determine whether probable cause existed to issue a search warrant\\nand a subpoena. The Court granted leave to appeal. \\n253 N.J. 394\\n (2023).\\n\\n                                          1\\n HELD: The proper analysis for determining whether the State can obtain this\\nphysical evidence rests within the principles of search and seizure under the Fourth\\nAmendment. Neither the Fifth nor the Sixth Amendment would preclude issuing a\\nvalid search warrant for the bullet in this case, and the trial court should have\\ndetermined whether there exists probable cause on which to issue such a warrant.\\n\\n1. The State applied for a search warrant, asserting that there was probable cause to\\nbelieve that evidence related to the alleged offenses committed on December 3, 2017\\nwas in Cooper Hospital’s possession. Instead of determining whether probable\\ncause existed to issue the warrant, the trial court analyzed the bullet evidence\\nthrough the lens of reciprocal discovery and determined that the State was not\\nentitled to access the bullet because its extraction was precipitated by defense\\ncounsel’s litigation choice. That is the incorrect analysis. The bullet in this case is\\nphysical evidence related to a criminal offense. Defendant has been charged with\\nattempted murder, among other offenses, and the bullet extracted from defendant’s\\nabdomen is physical evidence of relevant events. A search warrant is therefore the\\nproper means for the State to obtain the evidence. (pp. 12-13)\\n\\n2. Defendant argues that the constitutional protections offered by the Fifth and Sixth\\nAmendments bar the State from obtaining the bullet. In State v. Knight, the Court\\nheld today that “[c]ompelling defense counsel to turn over in discovery an item in\\nhis possession that is physical evidence of a crime does not trigger” Sixth\\nAmendment concerns. ___ N.J. ___, ___ (2024) (slip op. at 22). The Court further\\nruled that State v. Mingo, \\n77 N.J. 576\\n (1978), and State v. Williams, \\n80 N.J. 472\\n\\n(1979), were inapplicable to the factual scenario in Knight because the materials at\\nissue in Knight were physical evidence, not the product of the defense investigation.\\nLike the affidavits in Knight, the bullet in this case is nothing like the information\\nthe State sought in Mingo and Williams. Physical evidence of a crime cannot be\\nshielded from the State simply by defense counsel obscuring the evidence under the\\ncloak of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\\nNotwithstanding the fact that defense counsel suggested the elective surgery, and\\nirrespective of any agreements defense counsel believed she had with Cooper\\nHospital, the subject item is physical evidence and is reachable via search warrant if\\nprobable cause is established. Regarding the Fifth Amendment, as stated in Knight,\\nthe privilege against self-incrimination is a personal one and cannot be asserted by\\nor on behalf of third parties. See ___ N.J. at ___ (slip op. at 24). Here, defendant is\\nattempting to do just that.

Defense counsel coordinated with\\n\\nthe hospital where the surgery was conducted to have her investigator take\\n\\npossession of the bullet after the surgery. Post-surgery, however, the\\n\\nhospital’s director of security contacted law enforcement regarding the\\n\\nremoval of the bullet and did not turn it over to the defense.\\n\\n      The State subsequently sought a search warrant to obtain the bullet from\\n\\nthe hospital. The trial court denied the search warrant application and the\\n\\nState’s application for a subpoena seeking defendant’s medical records\\n\\nregarding the surgery. The Appellate Division reversed, holding that the trial\\n\\n                                        2\\n court erred in applying discovery rules as opposed to search warrant principles\\n\\nto its analysis of the search warrant application. The Appellate Division\\n\\nremanded the matter for the trial court to determine whether probable cause\\n\\nexisted for the issuance of the search warrant.\\n\\n      We granted defendant’s motion for leave to appeal and now affirm. The\\n\\nproper analysis for determining whether the State can obtain this physical\\n\\nevidence rests within the principles of search and seizure under the Fourth\\n\\nAmendment. The Appellate Division properly remanded the matter for a\\n\\ndetermination of whether probable cause existed to issue a search warrant to\\n\\nthe hospital -- a third party -- that is in possession of physical evidence related\\n\\nto a criminal offense.\\n\\n                                         I.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      We derive the facts throughout this opinion from the pretrial record.\\n\\n      On December 3, 2017, at approximately 3:50 a.m., Camden County\\n\\nMetropolitan Police Department (Camden County Police) officers were\\n\\nconducting an unrelated investigation in the area of Louis and Chestnut Streets\\n\\nin Camden when they heard gunfire nearby. At the time, defendant had\\n\\nattempted to re-enter a bar or “speakeasy” located at 1120 Louis Street but was\\n\\ndenied entry after a pat-down revealed defendant had a handgun in his\\n\\n                                         3\\n possession. Defendant then reached for his gun, after which a struggle ensued,\\n\\ncausing him to discharge the weapon one time inside the building. Defendant\\n\\nwas removed from the bar and walked away from the building down Louis\\n\\nStreet.\\n\\n      When officers arrived at the bar, a witness pointed them in defendant’s\\n\\ndirection. As the officers continued on Louis Street, they encountered\\n\\ndefendant, who allegedly fired at least one shot at them. Officers returned fire,\\n\\nstriking defendant multiple times: once in each hip with .32 caliber bullets and\\n\\nonce in one elbow with a .40 caliber bullet. After a brief foot chase that led\\n\\nthe officers onto Sycamore Street, officers arrested defendant and transported\\n\\nhim to Cooper University Hospital (Cooper Hospital) in Camden to obtain\\n\\ntreatment for his gunshot wounds, including emergency surgery. While\\n\\ncanvassing the crime scene, officers recovered a .32 caliber handgun on the\\n\\nsidewalk on Sycamore Street, and two .32 caliber shell casings, one located\\n\\ninside, and the other located outside the bar at 1120 Louis Street.\\n\\n      The next day, defendant gave a statement to officers while at Cooper\\n\\nHospital. Defendant stated that he was at a party at the bar, and that he left to\\n\\ngo to the store but was denied reentry upon returning. Defendant claimed he\\n\\nwas forced back onto the street and shot shortly thereafter, but he did not know\\n\\nwho shot him or why.\\n\\n                                        4\\n       In February 2018, a grand jury indicted defendant on three counts of\\n\\nfirst-degree attempted murder, three counts of second-degree aggravated\\n\\nassault, three counts of fourth-degree aggravated assault, second-degree\\n\\npossession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and second-degree unlawful\\n\\npossession of a weapon.\\n\\n      In July 2018, the Camden County Prosecutor’s Office asked Cooper\\n\\nHospital whether the treating physicians had removed any bullet or metal\\n\\nfragments from defendant’s body during his surgery. A hospital employee\\n\\nresponded that an X-ray located a bullet in defendant’s abdomen, but the\\n\\ntreating physician did not remove it.\\n\\n      In 2021, the State moved to compel discovery of “any physical evidence,\\n\\nreports, records, or other materials” concerning defendant’s wounds. The\\n\\nState explained that it had no other basis to identify the bullets that struck\\n\\ndefendant. The trial court denied the State’s motion to compel discovery. The\\n\\ncourt reasoned that, under State v. Williams, \\n80 N.J. 472\\n (1979), and Rule\\n\\n3:13-3, the State was not entitled to those materials unless the defense planned\\n\\nto use or rely on them at trial. A week later, defendant was released from\\n\\ncustody while awaiting trial.\\n\\n      In 2022, on the advice of counsel, defendant decided to undergo elective\\n\\nsurgery to remove the bullet that had remained lodged in his abdomen since\\n\\n                                         5\\n the December 2017 incident. On June 9, 2022, defense counsel sent a letter to\\n\\nCooper Hospital requesting that it turn the bullet over to defense counsel’s\\n\\ninvestigator after the surgery. Defense counsel represented that her office had\\n\\nmultiple communications about the bullet with hospital staff, who “all agreed”\\n\\nto the defense’s request to take possession of the extracted bullet post-surgery.\\n\\n      On June 15, 2022, physicians removed the bullet from defendant’s body\\n\\nand turned it over to Joseph Campbell, the Administrative Director of Security\\n\\nat Cooper Hospital, pursuant to hospital policy. Thereafter, a hospital\\n\\nemployee contacted defense counsel, confirmed that physicians had removed\\n\\nthe bullet, and told counsel where to pick it up. After receiving the bullet,\\n\\nhowever, Campbell contacted a Camden County Police officer to inquire\\n\\nwhether the bullet concerned a police matter. The officer informed Campbell\\n\\nthat the bullet was tied to an active case assigned to the Camden County\\n\\nProsecutor’s Office. Thereafter, Campbell stored the bullet in anticipation that\\n\\nlaw enforcement officials would follow up, and he refused to turn it over to\\n\\ndefense counsel’s investigator.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      On June 30, 2022, the State applied for an ex parte search warrant to\\n\\nobtain from Cooper Hospital the bullet and any fragments removed from\\n\\ndefendant’s body during the elective surgery. The State also applied for a\\n\\n                                        6\\n Dyal 1 subpoena seeking all medical records that Cooper Hospital created\\n\\nregarding defendant’s treatment and transportation from the day of the surgery\\n\\nuntil defendant’s discharge. On July 7, 2022, the trial court advised defendant\\n\\nof the State’s applications, permitting him to oppose them at a hearing.\\n\\n      After hearing oral argument on the motion, the trial court denied the\\n\\nState’s applications and held that defense counsel was entitled to take\\n\\npossession of the bullet and any fragments from Cooper Hospital according to\\n\\nthe arrangements that defense counsel made with hospital staff before\\n\\ndefendant’s surgery. The trial court found that the discovery rules shielded the\\n\\nbullet from the State’s access because the bullet’s existence was the result of\\n\\ndefense counsel’s “conscious litigation choice.” The court reasoned that,\\n\\nunder Williams, \\n80 N.J. at 479\\n, “the defense is entitled to conduct an\\n\\ninvestigation and . . . to keep the results of that investigation to itself unless\\n\\nand until the defense chooses to use that information at trial.”\\n\\n      The trial court further explained that if defense counsel tested the bullet,\\n\\nshe would have to disclose the test results to the State only if she intended to\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  A Dyal subpoena is an application to the court for the issuance of a subpoena\\nto obtain medical records. State v. Dyal, \\n97 N.J. 229\\n, 240 (1984). In Dyal,\\nthis Court determined that, in light of the protection accorded to medical\\nrecords due to the doctor-patient privilege, subpoenas for medical records are\\nto be treated “as the functional equivalent of a search warrant” and issued only\\nupon a showing of probable cause. \\nId. at 241\\n.\\n                                         7\\n use them at trial. According to the trial court, because the bullet would not\\n\\neven be available to the State if not for the defense’s conscious litigation\\n\\ndecision, it was “up to the defense to decide what it chooses to do” with it.\\n\\nThe trial court did not explain its reasons for denying the Dyal subpoena. The\\n\\nnext day, the State applied for a stay of the trial court’s order pending its\\n\\ninterlocutory appeal to the Appellate Division, which the trial court denied.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division granted the State’s motion for leave to appeal\\n\\nand its emergent application for a temporary stay of the trial court’s order.\\n\\nThe State argued that the trial court erred by applying discovery rules rather\\n\\nthan the Fourth Amendment to the State’s warrant and Dyal subpoena\\n\\napplications.\\n\\n      In an unpublished opinion, the Appellate Division reversed and\\n\\nremanded the matter to the trial court to determine whether probable cause\\n\\nexisted to issue a search warrant and a Dyal subpoena. The Appellate Division\\n\\nobserved that the trial court had accepted defendant’s claim that the bullet was\\n\\n“a fruit of the defense investigation strategy to undergo elective surgery” and\\n\\nhad therefore treated the search warrant application “as if it were a motion to\\n\\ncompel reciprocal discovery.” The Appellate Division concluded that the\\n\\nFourth Amendment, rather than the Sixth Amendment and reciprocal discovery\\n\\nrules, provided the appropriate legal framework because the State sought a\\n\\n                                         8\\n search warrant and a Dyal subpoena to obtain physical evidence in a third\\n\\nparty’s possession. The Appellate Division found it irrelevant whether Cooper\\n\\nHospital defied any purported agreement or understanding with defendant to\\n\\nturn the bullet over to defense counsel’s investigator.\\n\\n      Defendant subsequently filed a motion for leave to appeal the Appellate\\n\\nDivision’s judgment, which we granted. \\n253 N.J. 394\\n (2023). We also\\n\\ngranted the applications of the Attorney General, the Association of Criminal\\n\\nDefense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL), and the Public Defender to\\n\\nparticipate as amici curiae.\\n\\n                                        II.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Defendant urges this Court to reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment\\n\\nand reinstate the trial court’s order denying the State’s search warrant and\\n\\nDyal subpoena applications. Defendant argues that the State cannot compel\\n\\nhim to disclose inculpatory evidence discovered through a defense\\n\\ninvestigation in preparation for trial because doing so violates his Sixth\\n\\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel, which includes a right to\\n\\nconduct a confidential investigation. Defendant asserts that the Appellate\\n\\nDivision erred in finding that the bullet was in a third party’s custody; rather,\\n\\ndefendant insists the bullet remained in his constructive possession. Defendant\\n\\n                                        9\\n reasons that Cooper Hospital physicians acted as his agents when they\\n\\nperformed the elective surgery and only temporarily possessed the bullet, with\\n\\nthe understanding that hospital staff would give the bullet to the defense.\\n\\nDefendant claims that the Cooper Hospital physicians were no different from\\n\\nexperts retained by the defense to conduct evaluations as part of the defense’s\\n\\npretrial investigation.\\n\\n      Defendant additionally argues that his Fifth Amendment privilege\\n\\nagainst self-incrimination bars the State from using a search warrant to obtain\\n\\nphysical evidence from the defense. He claims that the Fifth Amendment\\n\\naffords protection against the State when it seeks to “rip evidence from the\\n\\nhands of the defense.”\\n\\n      The Public Defender and the ACDL, appearing as amici, support\\n\\ndefendant’s arguments. Amici echo defendant’s assertion that his litigation\\n\\nchoice to remove the bullet and Cooper Hospital’s agreement on this matter\\n\\nturned the hospital into defendant’s agent for purposes of his Sixth\\n\\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The Public Defender adds\\n\\nthat defendant’s right to effective assistance of counsel shields evidence that\\n\\ndefense counsel or defendant’s agent generates or makes available for\\n\\ninvestigative purposes that would not otherwise exist or be available to the\\n\\nState. The ACDL adds that resolving the Sixth Amendment claim obviates the\\n\\n                                       10\\n need to address the Fifth Amendment issue, but that the latter’s protection\\n\\nagainst self-incrimination counsels against issuing the search warrant.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      The State urges this Court to affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment\\n\\non Fourth Amendment grounds because the bullet is physical evidence related\\n\\nto a crime and its existence preceded any defense investigation. The State\\n\\nreasons that the evidence existed because police shot defendant when they\\n\\nexchanged gunfire at the crime scene, not because of defense counsel’s\\n\\ninvestigation or trial preparation. The State asserts that it did not seek to\\n\\ncompel defendant to disclose anything; rather, it applied for a search warrant\\n\\nand a Dyal subpoena to access evidence in a third-party’s custody.\\n\\n      The Attorney General, appearing as amicus curiae, echoes the State’s\\n\\nargument that the use of a valid search warrant to secure physical evidence of a\\n\\ncrime in a third party’s custody does not implicate a defendant’s Sixth\\n\\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The Attorney General\\n\\nadds that the requested search warrant would not improperly “compel”\\n\\ndefendant because it is not an order to compel reciprocal discovery, the bullet\\n\\nis not akin to attorney work product, and the bullet may be exculpatory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        11\\n                                         III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      We first address the appropriate legal framework within which to assess\\n\\nthe State’s effort to obtain the bullet for use in its prosecution of defendant.\\n\\n      Here, the State applied for a search warrant and detailed through an\\n\\nofficer’s affidavit the shooting incident on December 3, 2017. The affidavit\\n\\nfurther provided the officer’s knowledge regarding defendant’s June 2022\\n\\nsurgery to remove the bullet that remained lodged in his abdomen and the fact\\n\\nthat the extracted bullet was in Cooper Hospital’s possession. In sum, the\\n\\nsearch warrant application asserted that there was probable cause to believe\\n\\nthat evidence related to the alleged offenses committed on December 3, 2017\\n\\nwas in Cooper Hospital’s possession. See State v. Gathers, \\n234 N.J. 208\\n, 223-\\n\\n24 (2018) (“Probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant requires ‘a fair\\n\\nprobability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular\\n\\nplace.’”) (quoting State v. Chippero, \\n201 N.J. 14\\n, 28 (2009)).\\n\\n      Instead of determining whether probable cause existed to issue the\\n\\nwarrant, the trial court analyzed the bullet evidence through the lens of\\n\\nreciprocal discovery and determined that the State was not entitled to access\\n\\nthe bullet because its extraction was precipitated by defense counsel’s\\n\\nlitigation choice.\\n\\n                                        12\\n       We hold that to be the incorrect analysis. The bullet in this case is\\n\\nphysical evidence related to a criminal offense. Defendant has been charged\\n\\nwith attempted murder, among other offenses, related to the December 3,\\n\\n2017, incident during which he allegedly fired a gun at police, prompting\\n\\nofficers to return fire. The bullet extracted from defendant’s abdomen is\\n\\nphysical evidence of that evening’s events. A search warrant is therefore the\\n\\nproper means for the State to obtain the evidence.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      Defendant argues that, regardless of the mechanism used to seek the\\n\\nbullet, the constitutional protections offered by the Fifth and Sixth\\n\\nAmendments to the United States Constitution bar the State from obtaining the\\n\\nbullet.\\n\\n      Our holding today in State v. Knight controls regarding defendant’s\\n\\nconstitutional arguments. See ___ N.J. ___, ___ (2024) (slip op. at 3). In\\n\\nKnight, the defendant was charged with murder and two witnesses identified\\n\\nhim as the shooter. \\nId.\\n at ___ (slip op. at 3-4). One witness was allegedly\\n\\nlured to a house by a woman he communicated with on social media and\\n\\nforced at gunpoint by several individuals to draft an affidavit recanting his\\n\\nidentification of the defendant. \\nId.\\n at ___ (slip op. at 5). Believing that the\\n\\nassailants gave the alleged forced recantation affidavit to the defendant’s\\n\\n                                        13\\n attorney, the State moved to compel discovery of that affidavit (and possibly a\\n\\nsecond affidavit from the other eyewitness) from defense counsel pursuant to\\n\\nreciprocal discovery Rule 3:3-13(b)(2). \\nId.\\n at ___ (slip op. at 7-8).\\n\\n      In upholding the trial court’s grant of the State’s motion to compel, we\\n\\nheld that the sought-after affidavits in that case were physical evidence of a\\n\\ncrime and, therefore, “discoverable pursuant to our discovery rules and []\\n\\nneither the Fifth nor Sixth Amendment shield their production.” \\nId.\\n at ___\\n\\n(slip op. at 21). Although the State sought access to the affidavits in question\\n\\nin Knight via the court rules governing defendants’ reciprocal discovery\\n\\nobligations rather than via search warrant, as occurred here, the same\\n\\nreasoning applies in both matters with regard to the rights of criminal\\n\\ndefendants under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\\n\\n      In Knight, we held that “[c]ompelling defense counsel to turn over in\\n\\ndiscovery an item in his possession that is physical evidence of a crime does\\n\\nnot trigger” Sixth Amendment concerns. \\nId.\\n at ___ (slip op. at 22). We\\n\\nfurther ruled that this Court’s holdings in State v. Mingo and State v. Williams\\n\\nwere inapplicable to the factual scenario in Knight because the materials at\\n\\nissue in that case were physical evidence, not the product of the defense\\n\\ninvestigation. \\nId.\\n at ___ (slip op. at 23) (discussing Mingo, \\n77 N.J. 576\\n, 580\\n\\n(1978), in which the State sought to compel disclosure of an inculpatory\\n\\n                                       14\\n defense expert report that the defendant did not intend to use or rely on at trial,\\n\\nand Williams, \\n80 N.J. at 476\\n, in which the State sought disclosure of victim\\n\\ninterview memoranda prepared by defense counsel and pictures shown to the\\n\\nvictim during the interview).\\n\\n      Like the affidavits in Knight, the bullet in this case is nothing like the\\n\\ninformation the State sought in Mingo and Williams. Here, the bullet is\\n\\nphysical evidence that came into existence at the time of the alleged criminal\\n\\noffense. The bullet did not materialize as a result of defense counsel’s pretrial\\n\\ninvestigation, nor did it come into existence because defense counsel\\n\\nrecommended that defendant undergo elective surgery to have the bullet\\n\\nremoved.\\n\\n      Defendant’s agency argument, in which he argues that the hospital\\n\\nemployees acted as his agents similar to an expert retained to complete a\\n\\npretrial expert report, is also unpersuasive. The bullet in this case is nothing\\n\\nlike the expert report in Mingo. The bullet itself predated the defense\\n\\ninvestigation and existed even before defense counsel’s representation of\\n\\ndefendant. Contrary to defendant’s argument, the bullet is not a fruit of the\\n\\ndefense investigation; rather, it is a “fruit[], instrumentalit[y], or other\\n\\nevidence of a crime.” Chippero, \\n201 N.J. at\\n29 n.6.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         15\\n       Such an item is not subject to the same Sixth Amendment analysis that\\n\\nwas relevant in Mingo and Williams. It frankly cannot be that physical\\n\\nevidence of a crime can be shielded from the State simply by defense counsel\\n\\nobscuring the evidence under the cloak of the Sixth Amendment right to\\n\\neffective assistance of counsel. Notwithstanding the fact that defense counsel\\n\\nsuggested the elective surgery, and irrespective of any agreements defense\\n\\ncounsel believed she had with Cooper Hospital, the subject item is physical\\n\\nevidence and is reachable via search warrant if probable cause is established.\\n\\n      Regarding the Fifth Amendment, as we stated in Knight, the privilege\\n\\nagainst self-incrimination is a personal one and cannot be asserted by or on\\n\\nbehalf of third parties. See Knight, ___ N.J. at ___ (slip op. at 24). Defendant\\n\\nis attempting to do just that: assert his Fifth Amendment privilege against\\n\\nself-incrimination in response to a warrant that would be served upon a third\\n\\nparty -- Cooper Hospital. Defendant argues that “the Fifth Amendment affords\\n\\nits protections whether the state uses a subpoena or a search warrant to rip\\n\\nevidence from the hands of the defense.” The moment the bullet was extracted\\n\\nfrom defendant’s body, Cooper Hospital alone possessed the bullet, which\\n\\ntriggered its statutory reporting obligations regarding an injury occasioned by\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       16\\n a firearm. 2 No evidence is being ripped from defendant’s hands as Cooper\\n\\nHospital is in possession of the bullet and the search warrant, if issued, would\\n\\nbe served on the hospital, not on defendant.\\n\\n      In sum, neither the Fifth nor the Sixth Amendment would preclude\\n\\nissuing a valid search warrant for the bullet in this case, and the trial court\\n\\nshould have determined whether there exists probable cause on which to issue\\n\\nsuch a warrant.\\n\\n                                        IV.\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment\\n\\nand remand this matter to the trial court to determine whether the State has\\n\\nestablished probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant and the Dyal\\n\\nsubpoena.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  Defendant also argues that in advising the State that the hospital had\\nperformed the surgery and was in possession of the bullet, Cooper Hospital\\nviolated the privacy provisions of HIPAA, the Federal Health Insurance\\nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d-1 to -9, which\\nregulates the use and disclosure of personal medical information. Defendant’s\\nargument, however, is inconsistent with New Jersey statutes. Pursuant to\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:58-8(a), Cooper Hospital was statutorily required to report to law\\nenforcement officials the extraction of a bullet from a hospital patient and\\nproperly complied with that statute in doing so.\\n\\n                                        17\\n     CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nWAINER APTER, FASCIALE and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE PIERRE-\\nLOUIS’s opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            18\\n '),\n",

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n                      State v. Isaiah J. Knight (A-39-22) (087822)\\n\\nArgued October 10, 2023 -- Decided March 5, 2024\\n\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n        In this appeal, the Court considers whether, pursuant to New Jersey discovery\\nrules, the State can obtain from defense counsel an affidavit that constitutes physical\\nevidence of a crime.\\n\\n      On June 1, 2021, Tyzier White was fatally shot as he stood outside of the\\nNeptune Lounge, a bar in Newark. Two men, known by their nicknames as “Zay”\\nand “DJ Neptune,” witnessed the shooting. Both men provided sworn statements in\\nwhich they identified the shooter, and both later selected defendant Isaiah Knight’s\\nphotograph from a photo array. On June 16, law enforcement arrested defendant.\\n\\n       On December 21, 2021, Zay gave a statement to law enforcement, claiming\\nthat a woman he met online took him to a residence in Newark. At some point after\\narriving at the residence and spending time with the woman, three individuals,\\nincluding two masked men armed with guns, entered the room where Zay was. Zay\\nstated that he was given a written affidavit and told to copy it. The affidavit\\nrecanted Zay’s original statement to law enforcement identifying defendant as the\\nshooter. After Zay copied the recanting affidavit, the captors released him.\\nDefendant’s sister and cousin were identified as two of the perpetrators and charged\\nwith witness tampering. A superseding indictment also charged defendant with\\nsecond-degree conspiracy to commit witness tampering and two counts of second-\\ndegree kidnapping.\\n\\n       On April 4, 2022, the State filed a motion to compel discovery of the\\ndocument Zay was allegedly forced to write, believing that defendant’s alleged co-\\nconspirators turned it over to his counsel. The State’s certification in support of its\\nmotion to compel further alleged that DJ Neptune may have been forced to\\ntranscribe a similar recantation and that defense counsel might possess that\\ndocument as well. The trial court granted the State’s motion to compel discovery,\\nand the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court’s order. The Court granted leave\\nto appeal. 253 N.J. 546 (2023).\\n\\n\\n                                           1\\n HELD: The sought-after affidavit is physical evidence of the crimes of witness\\ntampering and kidnapping for which defendant and others have been charged. It is\\ntherefore subject to reciprocal discovery under Rule 3:3-13(b)(2)(B) and (D).\\n\\n1. Rule 3:13-3 codifies New Jersey’s open-file approach to pretrial discovery in\\ncriminal matters post-indictment. Although a defendant has a right to automatic and\\nbroad discovery of the evidence the State has gathered in support of its charges upon\\nthe issuance of an indictment, the Rule also places the onus on defense counsel to\\nsupply the prosecution with broad categories of items. This is often referred to as\\nthe “reciprocal discovery” rule or process. Under Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(B) and (D),\\nrespectively, a defendant must provide the State with materials including “any\\nrelevant books, papers, [or] documents, including “writings,” that are “within the\\npossession, custody or control of defense counsel,” as well as with “written\\nstatements, if any, . . . made by any witnesses whom the State may call as a witness\\nat trial.” Significantly, the Rule “does not require discovery of a party’s work\\nproduct consisting of internal reports, memoranda or documents made by that party\\nor the party’s attorney or agents, in connection with the investigation, prosecution or\\ndefense of the matter.” R. 3:13-3(d) (emphases added). (pp. 13-15)\\n\\n2. Beyond the Rule’s own exception, constitutional guarantees may bar compelling\\ndisclosure of certain materials in certain situations. The right against self-\\nincrimination applies when the accused is compelled to make a testimonial\\ncommunication that is incriminating. However, both the state and Fifth Amendment\\nprivileges against self-incrimination are personal to the defendant and cannot be\\nasserted by or on behalf of third parties. The Sixth Amendment to the United States\\nConstitution and Article I, Paragraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution ensure the\\ncriminally accused the right to effective assistance of counsel, which includes the\\nright to a thorough defense investigation. In State v. Mingo, the Court held that\\ndefense counsel cannot be compelled, via discovery, to give the State inculpatory\\nexpert materials it generated in preparation for trial unless the defense intends to\\nintroduce or use that expert evidence at trial, noting that such a rule furthers the\\nright to effective assistance of counsel because defense counsel will not be deterred\\nfrom “seek[ing] out expert evidence” to aid its defense that may turn out to be\\nunfavorable. 77 N.J. 576, 582, 584 (1978). And one year after the Mingo decision,\\nthe Court expanded its holding to include statements or summaries of statements\\nmade by a State witness to defense counsel when the defense does not intend to use\\nthe statements at trial. State v. Williams, 80 N.J. 472, 480-82 (1979). The Court\\nnoted that “[i]t is abhorrent to our concept of criminal justice to compel a defendant,\\nunder the guise of reciprocal discovery, to disclose to the State inculpatory evidence\\nuncovered by defense counsel during his preparation for trial and then allow the\\nState to use that evidence as part of its case in chief.” Id. at 479. (pp. 15-21)\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n 3. In this matter, neither party disputes that defense counsel played no role\\nwhatsoever in the genesis of Zay’s affidavit. The affidavit’s creation was allegedly\\nthe result of a kidnapping and witness intimidation plot for which defendant and two\\nother individuals have been criminally charged. The affidavit, therefore, is physical\\nevidence of a crime and does not fall within the exception to the discovery\\nobligations set forth in Rule 3:13-3(d). Rather, the affidavit is a relevant writing\\npotentially in defense counsel’s possession pursuant to Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(B). The\\naffidavit would also fall under Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(D) as a written statement by a\\nwitness that the State intends to call at trial. Compelling defense counsel to turn\\nover in discovery an item in his possession that is physical evidence of a crime does\\nnot trigger the same Sixth Amendment concerns found in Williams and Mingo.\\nFurther, because the discovery request here is directed to counsel, not defendant, and\\npertains to materials allegedly provided by others, defendant’s Fifth Amendment\\nright -- a right personal to defendant that cannot be asserted by or on behalf of third\\nparties -- is inapplicable here. The unique facts of this case lead to the conclusion\\nthat the affidavits, as physical evidence of a crime, fall within the discovery rules,\\nand no constitutional privilege stands in the way of their production. The State can\\nappropriately lay a foundation for the admission of the documents at trial by\\nsanitizing the manner in which it came into possession of the documents without\\nstating that the affidavits came from defense counsel.

Knight was charged with murder. 1 A witness to the\\n                                                                 0F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmurder gave a statement to police and identified defendant as the shooter.\\n\\nThereafter, the witness met a woman online, and the woman took him to a\\n\\nresidence in Newark. At some point after arriving at the residence and\\n\\nspending time with the woman in a room, three individuals, including two\\n\\nmasked men armed with guns, entered the room. The witness stated that he\\n\\nwas given a written affidavit and told to copy it. The affidavit recanted the\\n\\nwitness’s original statement to law enforcement identifying defendant as the\\n\\nshooter. After the witness copied the recanting affidavit, the captors released\\n\\nhim, and he then gave a statement to law enforcement regarding the ordeal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n    We derive the facts throughout this opinion from the pretrial record.\\n                                           2\\n Defendant’s sister and cousin were identified as two of the perpetrators and\\n\\ncharged with witness tampering.\\n\\n       The State, operating under the belief that the recantation affidavit was\\n\\ngiven to defendant’s attorney, moved to compel discovery of the affidavit from\\n\\ndefense counsel. Defendant objected, but the trial court granted the State’s\\n\\nmotion to compel. Defendant appealed, claiming that defense counsel cannot\\n\\nbe compelled to turn over the affidavit pursuant to this Court’s precedent and\\n\\nconstitutional privileges in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The Appellate\\n\\nDivision disagreed and affirmed.\\n\\n       We granted defendant’s motion for leave to appeal and now affirm. The\\n\\nsought-after affidavit is physical evidence of the crimes of witness tampering\\n\\nand kidnapping for which defendant and others have been charged. As such,\\n\\nthe affidavit is subject to reciprocal discovery under ----\\n                                                       Rule 3:3-13(b)(2)(B) and\\n\\n(D).\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n       On June 1, 2021, Tyzier White was fatally shot as he stood outside of the\\n\\nNeptune Lounge, a bar in Newark. Two men, known by their nicknames as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        3\\n “Zay” and “DJ Neptune,” witnessed the shooting. 2 Both men provided sworn\\n                                                 1F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstatements in which they identified the shooter as a man known to them by the\\n\\nnickname “B.A.” Zay added that he knew B.A.’s real name was Isaiah Knight\\n\\nbecause Zay and defendant have the same name. Both Zay and DJ Neptune\\n\\nlater selected defendant’s photograph from a photo array.\\n\\n      According to Zay, after the shooting, defendant threatened him and\\n\\nanother man, David Chappel, at gunpoint and forced them to drive defendant\\n\\nto his car, a BMW, in Chappel’s Chevrolet Malibu. Zay explained that upon\\n\\nreaching the BMW, defendant directed Zay to drive defendant’s BMW while\\n\\nChappel and defendant followed in the Malibu. Video footage shows\\n\\ndefendant entering Chappel’s Malibu, Zay entering the BMW, and the cars\\n\\ndriving off in tandem. When defendant subsequently exited the Malibu to\\n\\nretrieve his BMW, he allegedly told Zay, “Yo, tell your man I got his license\\n\\nplate, you don’t play with me.” In the days following the murder, defendant\\n\\nallegedly called other witnesses present at the Neptune Lounge at the time of\\n\\nthe murder in an effort to intimidate them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  Zay’s legal name is Isaiah V. Knight. Zay is not related to defendant. We\\nrefer to him by his nickname to avoid confusion with defendant. The record\\ndoes not reflect DJ Neptune’s legal name. We do not intend any disrespect by\\nreferring to these individuals by their nicknames.\\n                                         4\\n       On June 16, 2021, law enforcement arrested defendant on murder\\n\\ncharges. He has been detained pending trial since September 2021.\\n\\n      On December 21, 2021, Zay claimed that a woman he knew as\\n\\n“Aminah” from prior interactions contacted him on Instagram wanting to meet\\n\\nup. According to Zay, Aminah picked him up and drove him to 145 Hobson\\n\\nStreet in Newark, where an unknown woman let them into the multi-family\\n\\nresidence. Zay stated that once inside a bedroom on the second floor, he and\\n\\nAminah smoked marijuana. Zay recalled that at some point Aminah grabbed\\n\\nher coat and a lighter and said she wanted to go outside to smoke a cigarette.\\n\\nWhen she opened the door and left the room, however, the unknown woman\\n\\nwho had let them in, along with two masked men armed with guns, entered the\\n\\nbedroom.\\n\\n      Zay recalled that the men mentioned a “discovery packet.” Then, Zay\\n\\nclaims the woman handed him a written document and instructed him to copy\\n\\nit by hand onto another sheet of paper. The document was a written\\n\\n“affidavit,” the substance of which recanted Zay’s prior sworn statement to\\n\\npolice identifying defendant as the shooter. According to Zay, the affidavit\\n\\nstated that he had lied in his previous sworn statement under duress from\\n\\ndetectives and that no one should try to find him. Zay stated that as he began\\n\\nto write the words, “I, Isaiah Knight,” the woman said, “No, not his name.”\\n\\n                                       5\\n According to Zay, the men became enraged because they thought he was trying\\n\\nto be funny by signing defendant’s name as opposed to his own. Zay alleged\\n\\nthat the woman then snatched his phone, confirmed his name, and deleted all\\n\\nInstagram messages between him and Aminah. At one point, Zay said he\\n\\nrecognized one of the men, and the man acknowledged Zay’s identification by\\n\\nremoving his mask.\\n\\n      Zay recalled that as he continued to copy the text of the affidavit, the\\n\\nmen told him that they were going to kill him and leave him in the apartment\\n\\nas soon as he finished signing. But while looking through Zay’s phone, the\\n\\nwoman noticed that Zay had texted a friend about being at 145 Hobson Street.\\n\\nGiven Zay’s text message to his friend about his whereabouts, Zay overheard\\n\\nthe woman and two men discuss whether the friend would link Zay’s death to\\n\\nthe address if they killed him. As a result, the perpetrators released Zay.\\n\\n      The following day, Zay went to the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office\\n\\nHomicide Task Force and gave a second sworn statement describing the prior\\n\\nevening’s events. He also provided law enforcement with Instagram pictures\\n\\nof Aminah and the man he recognized. Law enforcement subsequently\\n\\nidentified Aminah as Aminah Anderson, defendant’s sister, and the man as\\n\\nSylvester Richardson, defendant’s cousin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        6\\n       Zay gave a third statement to law enforcement in which he identified\\n\\nboth Anderson and Richardson as two of the assailants from the December 21,\\n\\n2021 incident. He also revealed a text message that he received dated March\\n\\n21, 2022, threatening his parents by referencing his mother’s address and his\\n\\nfather’s place of employment.\\n\\n      In April 2022, law enforcement arrested Anderson and Richardson on\\n\\nwitness tampering charges. In his statement to law enforcement, Richardson\\n\\nadmitted that he is defendant’s cousin and that Anderson is defendant’s sister.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      On September 10, 2021, an Essex County grand jury indicted defendant\\n\\nfor the following offenses: first-degree murder, second-degree unlawful\\n\\npossession of a weapon, and second-degree possession of a weapon for an\\n\\nunlawful purpose. On March 16, 2022, an Essex County grand jury returned a\\n\\nsuperseding indictment against defendant which included the following\\n\\nadditional offenses: second-degree conspiracy to commit witness tampering\\n\\nand two counts of second-degree kidnapping.\\n\\n      On April 4, 2022, the State filed a motion to compel discovery of the\\n\\ndocument Zay was allegedly forced to write, believing that defendant’s alleged\\n\\nco-conspirators turned it over to his counsel. The State’s certification in\\n\\nsupport of its motion to compel further alleged that DJ Neptune may have been\\n\\n                                        7\\n forced to transcribe a similar recantation and that defense counsel might\\n\\npossess that document as well. 3\\n                               2F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      The trial court held a hearing on the State’s motion to compel discovery.\\n\\nIn opposing the motion, defendant relied on State v. Williams, 80 N.J. 472\\n\\n(1979), to argue that the State was not entitled to the affidavits under Rule\\n\\n3:13-3(b)(2) because he did not intend to use the affidavits at trial. The State\\n\\nargued that defense counsel had to turn over the affidavits because they are\\n\\nevidence of a crime and not privileged attorney work product.\\n\\n      The trial court granted the State’s motion to compel discovery. The\\n\\ncourt distinguished Williams, finding that the item at issue in that case was\\n\\nwork product formulated by defense counsel based on witness interviews.\\n\\nHere, the court reasoned that the affidavits are “evidence of the crime of\\n\\nwitness tampering, and not anything formulated or written based on defense’s\\n\\nown investigation or work product.”\\n\\n      The Appellate Division granted defendant’s motion for leave to appeal\\n\\nthe trial court’s order. In an unpublished opinion, the Appellate Division\\n\\naffirmed the trial court’s order compelling disclosure of the affidavits. The\\n\\ncourt concluded that Zay’s and DJ Neptune’s written statements, potentially\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Defense counsel has neither confirmed nor denied possessing either of these\\ndocuments or their existence to his knowledge.\\n                                       8\\n held by defense counsel, fall under the rubric of Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(D) because\\n\\nthe State intends to call them both as witnesses at trial. The court noted that\\n\\nthis case bore no resemblance to Williams because Williams involved a\\n\\ndefense attorney and his investigator interviewing the State’s witness. In this\\n\\ncase, the Appellate Division explained, “[n]o one suggests defense counsel . . .\\n\\nhad prior knowledge of, much less countenanced or actively participated in,\\n\\nthe alleged kidnapping incident.” The court concluded that the statements\\n\\nwere “the product of the alleged kidnapping and witness tampering activity\\n\\nundertaken by defendant’s relatives outside his presence,” as opposed to\\n\\nattorney work product.\\n\\n         The Appellate Division further rejected defendant’s arguments that\\n\\ndisclosure would violate his Sixth Amendment rights. Because the court found\\n\\nWilliams inapplicable, it also found the Sixth Amendment concerns noted by\\n\\nthis Court in Williams irrelevant. The Appellate Division observed that a\\n\\ndecision compelling disclosure in this case would not chill defense counsel\\n\\nfrom conducting investigations given the way the statements in this case came\\n\\nto be.\\n\\n         We granted defendant’s motion for leave to appeal. 253 N.J. 546\\n\\n(2023). We also granted motions by the Attorney General and the Association\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         9\\n of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL) to appear as amici\\n\\ncuriae.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Defendant urges this Court to reaffirm the longstanding rule that a\\n\\ndefendant must only disclose materials the defense intends to use or rely on at\\n\\ntrial. Defendant argues that, even if he or his counsel possess the affidavits,\\n\\nthe reciprocal discovery rule does not apply and he should not be required to\\n\\nturn them over because he does not intend to use them at trial. Defendant\\n\\nclaims that compelled production violates his Sixth Amendment right to\\n\\neffective assistance of counsel because, if he gave the affidavit to defense\\n\\ncounsel to seek legal advice, the communication is privileged. Thus,\\n\\ndefendant contends, compelled production produces a conflict of interest\\n\\nbetween him and defense counsel that would sever the attorney-client\\n\\nrelationship and undermine his right to effective assistance of counsel.\\n\\nAlternatively, defendant argues that the State could have sought a search\\n\\nwarrant or subpoena duces tecum to acquire the alleged affidavits, as opposed\\n\\nto improperly using the discovery rules to do so.\\n\\n      Defendant also claims that compelled production of the affidavits would\\n\\nviolate his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Defendant\\n\\n                                       10\\n asserts that because the discovery order is purportedly directed at him, the act\\n\\nof production would compel him to admit to possessing incriminating\\n\\nmaterials and thereby violate his right against self-incrimination.\\n\\n      The ACDL supports defendant’s position that the Court should not allow\\n\\nthe State to infringe upon the attorney-client relationship and a defendant’s\\n\\nSixth Amendment rights as a matter of routine via the discovery rules. The\\n\\nACDL submits that compelling disclosure will chill defense attorneys from\\n\\nconducting thorough investigations out of fear of generating inculpatory\\n\\nevidence that must be disclosed. Accordingly, the ACDL contends that this\\n\\nchilling effect will interfere with and hamper defense attorneys’ ability to\\n\\nrender effective assistance.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      The State argues that this Court should uphold the trial court and\\n\\nAppellate Division’s decisions. According to the State, ----\\n                                                        Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)’s\\n\\nplain language requires producing the affidavit in question because the State\\n\\nhas clearly stated its intention to call Zay at trial. Regarding defendant’s\\n\\nconstitutional arguments, the State contends that requiring defendant to\\n\\nproduce the affidavits does not violate his Fifth Amendment right against self-\\n\\nincrimination because the affidavits do not contain statements that defendant\\n\\nmade and because neither defendant nor defense counsel prepared the\\n\\n                                        11\\n documents. Alternatively, even if production is testimonial, the State contends\\n\\nthat the foregone conclusion exception applies to compel disclosure.\\n\\n      The State further argues that compelling production does not violate\\n\\ndefendant’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The\\n\\nState asserts that the attorney-client privilege is not implicated because defense\\n\\ncounsel simply possesses the affidavits after likely having received the\\n\\ndocuments from a co-defendant or a third party, as opposed to having prepared\\n\\nthe documents in anticipation of trial. Given that defense counsel did not\\n\\nprepare or assist in preparing the affidavits, the State contends that Williams is\\n\\ninapplicable.\\n\\n      The Attorney General echoes the State’s arguments regarding Rule 3:13-\\n\\n3(b)’s plain language and the alleged violations of defendant’s constitutional\\n\\nrights and asks this Court to affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment. The\\n\\nAttorney General adds that requiring the State to obtain search warrants in\\n\\nthese scenarios would risk a much greater intrusion into materials shielded by\\n\\nthe attorney-client privilege and confidentiality.\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Our scope of review in this matter is limited. State v. Brown, 236 N.J.\\n\\n497, 521 (2019). “[A]ppellate courts ‘generally defer to a trial court’s\\n\\n                                        12\\n disposition of discovery matters unless the court has abused its discretion or its\\n\\ndetermination is based on a mistaken understanding of the applicable law.’”\\n\\nIbid. (quoting Pomerantz Paper Corp. v. New Cmty. Corp., 207 N.J. 344, 371\\n\\n(2011)). Under the abuse of discretion standard, we “generously sustain [the\\n\\ntrial court’s] decision, provided it is supported by credible evidence in the\\n\\nrecord.” Id. at 522 (alteration in original) (quoting Est. of Hanges v. Metro.\\n\\nProp. & Cas. Ins. Co., 202 N.J. 369, 384 (2010)).\\n\\n      This Court “need not defer, however, to a discovery order that is well\\n\\n‘wide of the mark,’ or ‘based on a mistaken understanding of the applicable\\n\\nlaw.’” State v. Hernandez, 225 N.J. 451, 461 (2016) (first quoting State in Int.\\n\\nof A.B., 219 N.J. 542, 554 (2014); and then quoting Pomerantz, 207 N.J. at\\n\\n371)). We review a court rule’s meaning or scope de novo, affording “no\\n\\ndeference to the interpretative statements of the trial court and Appellate\\n\\nDivision, unless they are persuasive in their reasoning.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      As noted, defendant asserts that the affidavits are not subject to\\n\\ndisclosure under our discovery rules and that, even if they were, the Fifth and\\n\\nSixth Amendments would prevent their disclosure.\\n\\n      Rule 3:13-3 outlines the pretrial discovery process and procedure in\\n\\ncriminal matters. State v. Scoles, 214 N.J. 236, 252 (2013). The Rule codifies\\n\\n                                       13\\n New Jersey’s open-file approach to pretrial discovery in criminal matters post-\\n\\nindictment. State v. Ramirez, 252 N.J. 277, 295 (2022). The purpose behind\\n\\nthe open-file approach is “[t]o advance the goal of providing fair and just\\n\\ncriminal trials” and “the quest for truth.” Scoles, 214 N.J. at 252.\\n\\n      Although “a defendant has a right to automatic and broad discovery of\\n\\nthe evidence the State has gathered in support of its charges” upon the issuance\\n\\nof an indictment, the Rule also places the onus on defense counsel to supply\\n\\nthe prosecution with broad categories of items. Id. at 252-53; see also\\n\\nRamirez, 252 N.J. at 295-96; R. 3:13-3(b)(2). This is often referred to as the\\n\\n“reciprocal discovery” rule or process. See, e.g., State v. Tier, 228 N.J. 555,\\n\\n557 (2017); Williams, 80 N.J. at 478. The thrust behind the “reciprocal\\n\\ndiscovery” rule is “that the State is entitled to know in advance what evidence\\n\\na defendant intends to use at trial so that it may have a fair opportunity to\\n\\ninvestigate the veracity of such proof.” Williams, 80 N.J. at 478.\\n\\n      With regard to the defendant’s discovery obligations, Rule 3:13-3\\n\\nprovides, as relevant here, that a defendant must provide the State with “all\\n\\nrelevant material, including, but not limited to,”\\n\\n            (B) any relevant books, papers, documents or tangible\\n            objects, buildings or places or copies thereof, which are\\n            within the possession, custody or control of defense\\n            counsel, including, but not limited to, writings,\\n            drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, video and sound\\n            recordings, images, electronically stored information,\\n                                        14\\n             and any other data or data compilations stored in any\\n            medium from which information can be obtained and\\n            translated, if necessary, into reasonably usable form;\\n\\n            ...\\n\\n            (D) written statements, if any, including any\\n            memoranda reporting or summarizing the oral\\n            statements, made by any witnesses whom the State may\\n            call as a witness at trial. . . .\\n\\n            [R. 3:13-3(b)(2)(B), (D).]\\n\\nSignificantly, the Rule “does not require discovery of a party’s work product\\n\\nconsisting of internal reports, memoranda or documents made by that party or\\n\\nthe party’s attorney or agents, in connection with the investigation, prosecution\\n\\nor defense of the matter.” R. 3:13-3(d) (emphases added).\\n\\n      Beyond the Rule’s own exception, constitutional guarantees may bar\\n\\ncompelling disclosure of certain materials in certain situations.\\n\\n      The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that\\n\\n“[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness\\n\\nagainst himself.” Our State Constitution does not contain a parallel provision\\n\\nto the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but the privilege is\\n\\nfirmly established in this state’s common law and is codified in statute and in\\n\\nthe Rules of Evidence. See N.J.S.A. 2A:84A-19; N.J.R.E. 503. The right\\n\\nagainst self-incrimination “applies only when the accused is compelled to\\n\\n\\n                                         15\\n make a testimonial communication that is incriminating.” Fisher v. United\\n\\nStates, 425 U.S. 391, 408 (1976) (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Both the state and federal privileges against self-incrimination are\\n\\npersonal to the defendant and cannot be asserted by or on behalf of third\\n\\nparties. See State v. Baum, 199 N.J. 407, 419 (2009); Fisher, 425 U.S. at 410.\\n\\nOur Court has recognized that “a fundamental policy limiting the scope of the\\n\\nprivilege” is that “the Fifth Amendment privilege is a purely personal one.”\\n\\nBaum, 199 N.J. at 417 (quoting Bellis v. United States, 417 U.S. 85, 90\\n\\n(1974)).\\n\\n      The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,\\n\\nParagraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution ensure the criminally accused the\\n\\nright to effective assistance of counsel. See State v. Fritz, 105 N.J. 42, 58\\n\\n(1987) (holding that, in keeping with the federal standard, “a criminal\\n\\ndefendant is entitled to the assistance of reasonably competent counsel” under\\n\\nArticle I, Paragraph 10 of the State Constitution). In representing a criminal\\n\\ndefendant, defense counsel has a “duty to make reasonable investigations.”\\n\\nState v. Chew, 179 N.J. 186, 217 (2004). “The right to a ‘thorough defense\\n\\ninvestigation is also part of the right to counsel.’” State v. Martinez, 461 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 249, 276-77 (App. Div. 2019) (quoting State v. Nunez, 436 N.J. Super.\\n\\n70, 74-75 (App. Div. 2014)). That includes providing the defendant with the\\n\\n                                        16\\n “necessary tools, such as investigative support and expert analysis, that he\\n\\nneeds to carry on his defense.” State v. Melvins, 155 N.J. Super. 316, 320\\n\\n(App. Div. 1978).\\n\\n                                         C.\\n\\n      Defendant relies on two cases in which this Court found that a\\n\\ndefendant’s constitutional protections limited discovery obligations.\\n\\n      This Court has recognized that “[t]o safeguard the defense attorney’s\\n\\nability to provide the effective assistance guaranteed by these constitutional\\n\\nprovisions, it is essential that he be permitted full investigative latitude in\\n\\ndeveloping a meritorious defense on his client’s behalf.” State v. Mingo, 77\\n\\nN.J. 576, 582 (1978). Such latitude to conduct an investigation would be\\n\\nconstrained if defense counsel “must risk a potentially crippling revelation to\\n\\nthe State of information discovered in the course of investigation which he\\n\\nchooses not to use at trial.” Ibid.\\n\\n      In Mingo, this Court considered how the principles underlying the\\n\\nreciprocal discovery rule relate to the attorney work product privilege and the\\n\\nright to effective assistance of counsel. 77 N.J. at 587. In that case, defense\\n\\ncounsel sought to compel the State’s production of a note allegedly written by\\n\\nthe assailant. Id. at 579. Defense counsel wanted to engage a handwriting\\n\\nexpert to examine the note and compare the handwriting to defendant’s\\n\\n                                         17\\n handwriting. Ibid. The trial court granted defense counsel’s request,\\n\\nconditioned “on defense counsel’s agreeing to furnish the prosecutor with a\\n\\ncopy of any” expert report generated, regardless of whether defendant planned\\n\\nto use the report at trial. Ibid. After comparing defendant’s handwriting\\n\\nexemplars to the note, the defense expert concluded that the same person had\\n\\nwritten all the documents. Id. at 580. As a result of the expert report’s\\n\\ninculpatory nature, defense counsel decided to forego using the expert’s report\\n\\nat trial. Ibid. The State, however, having received the report from defense\\n\\ncounsel, subpoenaed the expert to testify on the State’s behalf, and the expert\\n\\ndid so. Ibid.\\n\\n      In considering whether the trial court should have admitted the expert’s\\n\\ntestimony, this Court held that defense counsel cannot be compelled, via\\n\\ndiscovery, to give the State inculpatory expert materials it generated in\\n\\npreparation for trial unless the defense intends to introduce or use that expert\\n\\nevidence at trial. Id. at 582, 584. We held that such a rule furthers the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel because defense counsel\\n\\nwill not be deterred from “seek[ing] out expert evidence” to aid its defense that\\n\\nmay turn out to be unfavorable. Id. at 582. This Court further explained that\\n\\n“[t]he protection from unwarranted disclosure we today mandate is an\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       18\\n indispensable element of a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to the\\n\\neffective assistance of counsel.” Id. at 587.\\n\\n      Although an attorney’s work product privilege is “closely analogous” to\\n\\nthe right of effective assistance of counsel, the Court rejected the argument\\n\\nthat the expert report at issue was work product. Id. at 585. The Court\\n\\nreasoned that the expert’s report “constitute[d] a species of evidence\\n\\nadmissible under some circumstances whereas true work product is inherently\\n\\ninadmissible.” Ibid.\\n\\n      One year after the Mingo decision, the Court expanded its holding to\\n\\ninclude statements or summaries of statements made by a State witness to\\n\\ndefense counsel when the defense does not intend to use the statements at trial.\\n\\nWilliams, 80 N.J. at 480-82. In Williams, defense counsel and his investigator\\n\\ninterviewed the victim on two occasions. Id. at 476. During the second\\n\\ninterview, the victim selected defendant’s picture in identifying him as the\\n\\nperpetrator. Ibid. That was the only time the victim identified the defendant\\n\\nas the assailant, and identification was at issue in the State’s case. Id. at 477,\\n\\n479-80.\\n\\n      The State moved for reciprocal discovery of the photographs and\\n\\ninterview memoranda. Id. at 476. Defendant objected because he did not\\n\\nintend to introduce any of those materials at trial. Ibid. The trial court granted\\n\\n                                        19\\n the State’s motion and ordered defendant, pursuant to Rule 3:13-3’s reciprocal\\n\\ndiscovery provisions, to turn over the defense’s victim interview memoranda\\n\\nas well as the photographs shown to the victim during the interview. Ibid.\\n\\n       After reviewing the materials, the State served subpoenas on counsel and\\n\\nhis investigator to testify as the State’s witnesses during trial. Ibid. To avoid\\n\\ntestifying, defense counsel stipulated to his interview with the victim. Ibid.\\n\\nDuring summation, the prosecutor emphasized that the victim’s sole\\n\\nidentification occurred when defendant’s own attorney showed her a picture of\\n\\nthe defendant. Id. at 477.\\n\\n       The Court concluded that the trial court’s order compelling reciprocal\\n\\ndiscovery of inculpatory material in defense counsel’s file trespassed on the\\n\\ndefendant’s right to effective assistance of counsel. Ibid. The Court explained\\n\\nthat Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(D) 4 applies to written statements or memoranda when\\n                           3F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe defense intends to use such evidence at trial; however, when counsel\\n\\ndecides not to use the evidence, Rule 3:13-3(d)’s work product protection\\n\\napplies. 5 Id. at 478-79. The Court noted that “[i]t is abhorrent to our concept\\n         4F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof criminal justice to compel a defendant, under the guise of reciprocal\\n\\n\\n4\\n  When this Court decided Williams, the relevant rules were numbered as Rule\\n3:13-3(b)(1) to (4). That numbering coincides with what is now Rule 3:13-\\n3(b)(2)(A) to (D).\\n5\\n    The work product rule was previously Rule 3:13(c); it is now Rule 3:13(d).\\n                                      20\\n discovery, to disclose to the State inculpatory evidence uncovered by defense\\n\\ncounsel during his preparation for trial and then allow the State to use that\\n\\nevidence as part of its case in chief.” Id. at 479. Finding that the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment bars such methods, the Court reasoned that its holding would\\n\\navoid a chilling effect and ensure that defense counsel could exercise\\n\\ndiscretion in preparing a proper defense for a client. Id. at 478-79.\\n\\n                                       IV.\\n\\n      Applying those principles, we hold that the affidavits in this case are\\n\\ndiscoverable pursuant to our discovery rules and that neither the Sixth nor the\\n\\nFifth Amendment shield their production.\\n\\n      Defendant relies on this Court’s prior caselaw regarding reciprocal\\n\\ndiscovery to support his argument that the affidavits, if they exist and are in\\n\\ndefense counsel’s possession, should not be turned over to the State. The\\n\\nholdings in Mingo and Williams, however, do not control in this factually\\n\\ndistinct and unique case. In Mingo, the State sought to obtain an inculpatory\\n\\nexpert report that defendant did not intend to use at trial. 77 N.J. at 580. In\\n\\nWilliams, the State sought to compel production of memoranda of a victim\\n\\ninterview the defense conducted and pictures that were shown to the victim.\\n\\n80 N.J. at 477. In both cases, the State tried to access materials and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        21\\n information created by defense counsel or at defense counsel’s direction in\\n\\npreparation for trial. That is simply not the case here.\\n\\n      In this matter, neither party disputes that defense counsel played no role\\n\\nwhatsoever in the genesis of Zay’s affidavit. The affidavit’s creation was\\n\\nallegedly the result of a kidnapping and witness intimidation plot for which\\n\\ndefendant and two other individuals have been criminally charged. The\\n\\naffidavit, therefore, is physical evidence of a crime. It is not the product of the\\n\\ndefense investigation or attorney work product, and it therefore does not fall\\n\\nwithin the exception to the discovery obligations set forth in Rule 3:13-3(d).\\n\\nRather, the affidavit is a relevant writing potentially in defense counsel’s\\n\\npossession pursuant to Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(B). There is no question that this\\n\\ntype of physical evidence falls squarely within defendant’s required reciprocal\\n\\ndiscovery obligations under that Rule.\\n\\n      The affidavit would also fall under Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(D) as a written\\n\\nstatement by a witness that the State intends to call at trial. Zay, as a witness\\n\\nto the murder and a victim of kidnapping and witness tampering, may be called\\n\\nby the State to testify at defendant’s trial. As such, this written affidavit that\\n\\nZay was allegedly forced to transcribe, is a written statement “made by a\\n\\nwitness whom the State may call as a witness at trial.” -----\\n                                                        See R. 3:13-3(b)(2)(D).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         22\\n       Compelling defense counsel to turn over in discovery an item in his\\n\\npossession that is physical evidence of a crime does not trigger the same Sixth\\n\\nAmendment concerns found in previous cases. This Court’s utmost concern in\\n\\nWilliams and Mingo was that requiring the defense to produce potentially\\n\\ninculpatory material uncovered during the defense investigation that the\\n\\ndefense did not intend to use at trial would have a chilling effect on defense\\n\\ncounsel’s ability to conduct thorough and in-depth pretrial investigations for\\n\\nfear that any such material would have to be turned over to the State. No such\\n\\nconcern is present in this case, however, in which the item in question is\\n\\nphysical evidence of a crime and not the product of defense counsel’s\\n\\ninvestigation. The State’s certification in support of its motion to compel\\n\\ndiscovery sufficiently presented facts regarding the alleged kidnapping and\\n\\ncreation of Zay’s affidavit to establish that this affidavit is physical evidence\\n\\nof a crime. 6\\n           5F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Defendant’s argument that compelling the discovery of this affidavit\\n\\nviolates his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is similarly\\n\\nunavailing. The State certified that it believes the affidavit is in defense\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n  As previously noted, the State also believes that DJ Neptune may have been\\nforced to draft a similar recantation affidavit. At oral argument on the motion\\nto compel, the State represented on the record that it had not been able to reach\\nDJ Neptune, “despite feverish and repeated attempts to do so.”\\n                                        23\\n counsel’s possession after having been turned over to counsel by defendant’s\\n\\nalleged co-conspirators. The discovery request, therefore, is directed to\\n\\ncounsel, not defendant, and it pertains to materials allegedly provided by\\n\\nothers. Again, the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination cannot be\\n\\nasserted by or on behalf of third parties because the Fifth Amendment right is\\n\\npersonal to defendant. See Baum, 199 N.J. at 417. As defendant is not being\\n\\ncompelled to do anything, the Fifth Amendment is inapplicable here.\\n\\n      The unique facts of this case lead this Court to the conclusion that the\\n\\naffidavits, as physical evidence of a crime, fall within our discovery rules,\\n\\neither Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(B) or Rule 3:13-3(b)(2)(D), and that no constitutional\\n\\nprivilege stands in the way of their production.\\n\\n      If counsel is in possession of the affidavits and turns them over, the State\\n\\nmust take precautions in introducing the affidavits at trial to avoid identifying\\n\\ndefense counsel as the source of the documents so as not to prejudice\\n\\ndefendant before the jury. The State can appropriately lay a foundation for the\\n\\nadmission of the documents at trial by sanitizing the manner in which the State\\n\\ncame into possession of the documents without stating that the affidavits came\\n\\nfrom defense counsel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       24\\n                                       V.\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment\\n\\nand remand this matter consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n    CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nWAINER APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE PIERRE-\\nLOUIS’s opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      25\\n '),\n",

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader.

(A-60/61-22) (088139)\\n\\nArgued November 6, 2023 -- Decided March 13, 2024\\n\\nRABNER, C.J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court considers whether the trial court properly dismissed\\nthe disability discrimination claims brought by condominium unit owners after the\\ncondominium association declined their request to have an emotional support animal\\n(ESA) based on the animal’s weight. The Court also addresses how requests of this\\ntype should be evaluated under New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination (LAD).\\n\\n       Plaintiff Players Place II Condominium Association limits pets “to the small\\ndomestic variety weighing thirty (30) pounds or less at maturity.” Defendant K.P.\\nagreed to be bound by the policy when he purchased a unit. His spouse, defendant\\nB.F., has been diagnosed with several mental health conditions, and K.P. notified the\\nAssociation that he and B.F. were “considering adopting an emotional support dog”\\nthat would “[m]ost likely . . . be over the 30lb pet limit.” Before the Association\\nresponded, B.F. adopted a 63-pound dog named Luna to live with her as an ESA.\\nAfter some further exchanges, counsel for the Association wrote that, “should a dog\\nweighing more than 30lbs . . . even enter the Association, the Association will\\nimmediately commence an action at law.” K.P. responded that assistance animals\\nare not considered pets and that, if the Association denied his claim, his “next step\\n[would] be to file a complaint . . . for disability discrimination.”\\n\\n       The Association filed a complaint asserting K.P. had violated the\\nAssociation’s rules because he had a dog that weighed more than 30 pounds and had\\nfailed to register the animal. K.P.’s answer included a counterclaim against the\\nAssociation for allegedly violating anti-discrimination laws.\\n\\n       The chancery court conducted a bench trial and heard testimony from an\\nofficer of the Association, multiple medical experts, defendants, and family\\nmembers. It dismissed defendants’ claims under the LAD and federal law, finding\\nthat B.F. was not “handicapped or disabled” within the meaning of the relevant\\nstatutes. The court allowed Luna to remain with B.F. on narrow equitable grounds,\\nhowever, because “this particular dog . . . offers her comfort and seems to assist her\\nin lessening her episodes,” and “ha[d] not been at all disruptive.”\\n                                           1\\n        A divided Appellate Division panel modified and affirmed the trial court’s\\njudgment. The majority found that “the judge acted within her discretion in\\nfashioning an equitable remedy suitable for the particular facts of the case.” The\\nmajority determined that the trial court misinterpreted the relevant statutes when it\\nfound B.F. was not disabled, but it affirmed the dismissal of the discrimination\\nclaims, finding “insufficient proof that having a dog that exceeded the weight limit\\nin the Association’s pet policy ‘was necessary to afford [B.F.] an equal opportunity\\nto use and enjoy’ the condominium unit.” The dissent agreed that defendants’\\nclaims were properly dismissed but disagreed with the award of equitable relief.\\n\\n      Plaintiff appealed as of right based on the dissent, R. 2:2-1(a)(2), and the\\nCourt granted defendants’ petition for certification, \\n254 N.J. 500\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Requests for reasonable accommodations like the one here should be\\nassessed under the following framework: Individuals who seek an accommodation\\nmust show that they have a disability under the LAD and demonstrate that the\\nrequested accommodation may be necessary to afford them an “equal opportunity to\\nuse and enjoy a dwelling.” N.J.A.C. 13:13-3.4(f)(2). Housing providers then have\\nthe burden to prove the requested accommodation is unreasonable. During that\\nprocess, both sides should engage in a good-faith, interactive dialogue. In the end, if\\nthe parties cannot resolve the request, courts may be called on to balance the need\\nfor, and benefits of, the requested accommodation against the cost and\\nadministrative burdens it presents. Here, the claims should not have been dismissed.\\n\\n1. The LAD prohibits discrimination in housing on account of a person’s disability,\\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-12(g)(2), including “any mental, psychological, or developmental\\ndisability,” \\nid.\\n at -5(q). It defines “disability” more broadly than federal law, which\\nrequires that a disability “substantially limits one or more . . . major life activities.”\\n42 U.S.C. § 3602\\n(h). The LAD includes no such requirement. (pp. 18-22)\\n\\n2. After reviewing relevant case law and guidance by state and federal agencies, the\\nCourt explains that a resident of a condominium complex is entitled to request an\\naccommodation to a pet policy in order to keep an emotional support animal. The\\nindividual must first demonstrate they have a disability under the LAD. In addition,\\nthey must show that the requested accommodation may be necessary to afford them\\nan “equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” N.J.A.C. 13:13-3.4(f)(2). The\\nhousing provider then has the burden to prove the requested accommodation is\\nunreasonable. As part of that process, the parties should engage in a good-faith,\\ninteractive dialogue to exchange information, consider alternative options, and\\nattempt to resolve or narrow any issues. If that collaborative effort fails and\\nlitigation follows, courts will inevitably need to balance the need for, and benefits\\nof, the requested accommodation against the costs and administrative burdens it\\npresents to determine whether the accommodation is reasonable. (pp. 22-27)\\n                                            2\\n 3. Here, there is no longer any dispute that B.F. is disabled within the meaning of\\nthe LAD. Whereas the trial court focused on the first of two ways to establish a\\nmental, psychological, or developmental disability under N.J.S.A. 10:5-5(q) -- a\\ndisability “which prevents the typical exercise of any bodily or mental functions” --\\nthe Appellate Division properly looked to the statute’s second ground -- a disability\\nthat “is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or\\nlaboratory diagnostic techniques.” And the record amply supports the Appellate\\nDivision’s conclusion that B.F. satisfied the second ground. In addition to\\nestablishing their disability, residents have the initial burden to demonstrate the\\naccommodation they seek is necessary. The question is whether the accommodation\\nwill alleviate at least one symptom of the disability, not whether the accommodation\\nwill cure or eliminate the disability. Here as well, trial testimony provided a record\\nfor the chancery court. The LAD does not require that an ESA be prescribed by a\\nmental health professional or that B.F. establish a specific need for a dog that\\nexceeded the weight limit. The Court notes that, when possible, it is preferable to\\nengage in a collaborative conversation in advance of acquiring an ESA. (pp. 27-32)\\n\\n4. The burden then shifts to the housing provider to prove the requested\\naccommodation was unreasonable -- a fact-specific weighing of the relevant costs\\nand benefits. The proper inquiry considers whether allowing an ESA would\\nfundamentally alter the housing provider’s operations or impose an undue financial\\nor administrative burden. Whether the animal has been trained is not a relevant\\nconsideration. Before a housing provider denies a request on reasonableness\\ngrounds, the parties should engage in good-faith, interactive discussions to evaluate\\nthe accommodation and explore possible alternatives. (pp. 33-34)\\n\\n5. The chancery court dismissed defendants’ discrimination claims and granted\\nrelief on equitable grounds under its review of the Association’s breach of contract\\nclaim. But in a dispute like this, the proper starting point is defendants’\\ndiscrimination claim. In light of the record in this case, the chancery court and\\nAppellate Division should not have dismissed B.F. and K.P.’s discrimination claim.\\nB.F. presented evidence of her need for an accommodation, which the Association\\ndisputes. Whether the Association has shown the accommodation sought is\\nunreasonable is also disputed. Both inquiries are fact-sensitive and were not\\naddressed at the bench trial. The Court therefore remands the matter and provides\\nguidance for the remand proceedings. (pp. 34-37)\\n\\n      REVERSED. The dismissal of defendants’ counterclaim is VACATED,\\nand the matter is remanded to the LAW DIVISION.\\n\\nJUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON, PIERRE-LOUIS, FASCIALE, and\\nNORIEGA join in CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER’s opinion.

Edelstein, of\\n            counsel and on the brief).\\n\\n\\n        CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n      In this case, an individual with a disability sought to have an emotional\\n\\nsupport animal live in her unit at a condominium complex. The condominium\\n\\nassociation declined the request because it does not allow residents to have\\n\\npets that weigh more than thirty pounds.\\n\\n      Emotional support animals (ESAs), however, are different from pets and\\n\\nare not subject to general pet policies. ESAs can help people who struggle\\n\\nwith mental health issues and other disabilities, and can enable them to\\n\\nfunction better in their everyday lives.\\n\\n      We now consider for the first time how to evaluate requests of this type\\n\\nunder New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 to\\n\\n10:5-50. We hold that requests for reasonable accommodations like the one\\n\\nhere should be assessed under the following framework: Individuals who seek\\n\\nan accommodation must show that they have a disability under the LAD and\\n\\ndemonstrate that the requested accommodation may be necessary to afford\\n\\nthem an “equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” N.J.A.C. 13:13-\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n 3.4(f)(2). Housing providers then have the burden to prove the requested\\n\\naccommodation is unreasonable.\\n\\n      During that process, both sides should engage in a good-faith, interactive\\n\\ndialogue. In the end, if the parties cannot resolve the request, courts may be\\n\\ncalled on to balance the need for, and benefits of, the requested\\n\\naccommodation against the cost and administrative burdens it presents. Judges\\n\\nwill then be able to determine whether the accommodation is reasonable under\\n\\nthe LAD.\\n\\n      For reasons that follow, we find that the discrimination claims the unit\\n\\nowners brought should not have been dismissed. We therefore reverse the\\n\\njudgment of the Appellate Division, vacate the dismissal of defendants’\\n\\ncounterclaim under the LAD and federal Fair Housing Act (FHA), \\n42 U.S.C.\\n\\n§§ 3601\\n to 3619, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      Players Place II is a condominium community in Gloucester Township.\\n\\nDefendant K.P. bought a unit there in May 2018. 1 0F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Because this opinion discusses confidential medical issues about K.P.’s\\nspouse, defendant B.F., we use initials to protect her privacy.\\n                                        3\\n       Plaintiff Players Place II Condominium Association operates the\\n\\ncondominium property. The Association’s rules and regulations include a pet\\n\\npolicy that limits pets “to the small domestic variety weighing thirty (30)\\n\\npounds or less at maturity.” Unit owners who acquire or replace a pet after\\n\\nbuying a unit are required to “contact the Association within two (2) weeks to\\n\\nrequest and complete a Pet Registration Form.” No pet that “causes a nuisance\\n\\nof any kind to another unit owner” “may be kept.” The policy exempts “[d]ogs\\n\\nused for the blind” from the weight restriction but does not mention emotional\\n\\nsupport animals.\\n\\n      K.P. agreed to be bound by the policy when he purchased a\\n\\ncondominium unit. In late July or early August 2018, K.P.’s girlfriend and\\n\\nnow spouse, B.F., moved into the unit. As discussed below, she has been\\n\\ndiagnosed with several mental health conditions.\\n\\n      K.P. notified the Association by email on August 2, 2018 that he and B.F.\\n\\nwere “considering adopting an emotional support dog” that would “[m]ost\\n\\nlikely . . . be over the 30lb pet limit.” K.P. asked what medical documentation\\n\\nwould be needed. On August 5, 2018, B.F. adopted a dog named Luna from a\\n\\nshelter to live with her as an ESA. At maturity, Luna would weigh more than\\n\\n30 pounds; according to the record, she weighed 63 pounds in January 2019.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        4\\n       The Association responded on August 7, 2018, without knowing that\\n\\nB.F. had already adopted Luna. In an email, the Association stated that it “will\\n\\nnot and cannot accommodate any alleged disability in regards to a dog that\\n\\nweighs in excess of 30 lbs. that has not yet been purchased or possessed.”\\n\\n      The following day, K.P. sent a second email and clarified that B.F. “is\\n\\nmoving in with me and she already has an emotional support dog.” K.P.\\n\\nattached a letter from B.F.’s psychiatric nurse practitioner, Natalie C.\\n\\nEisenhower, which stated that she had been treating B.F. since February 2018.\\n\\nEisenhower noted that B.F. “suffers from a mood and anxiety disorder” and\\n\\n“would benefit” from having an ESA.\\n\\n      Counsel for the Association responded on August 13, 2018. In a letter to\\n\\nK.P., counsel stated, “should a dog weighing more than 30lbs . . . even enter\\n\\nthe Association, the Association will immediately commence an action at law\\n\\nseeking a court order barring any dog weighing more than 30lbs.” Although\\n\\nthe Association offered its alternative dispute resolution program (ADR) to\\n\\naddress the issue, it added that, even if the parties proceeded to ADR, the\\n\\nAssociation “will still commence legal action . . . should a dog weighing more\\n\\nthan 30lbs . . . enter the Association.”\\n\\n      Two days later, K.P. emailed the attorney and noted that, according to the\\n\\nUnited States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),\\n\\n                                           5\\n “assistance animals are not considered pets.” K.P. wrote that if the Association\\n\\ndenied his claim, his “next step [would] be to file a complaint with HUD for\\n\\ndisability discrimination.”\\n\\n      In late September or early October 2018, the Association’s board\\n\\npresident saw B.F. walking Luna on the condominium grounds. At no point\\n\\ndid anyone file a noise complaint or claim that Luna caused any property\\n\\ndamage.\\n\\n                                      B.\\n\\n      The Association filed a complaint against K.P. on October 3, 2018. It\\n\\nasserted K.P.’s conduct violated the Association’s master deed, bylaws, and\\n\\nrules and regulations because he had a dog that weighed more than 30 pounds\\n\\nand had failed to register the animal. K.P.’s answer included a counterclaim\\n\\nagainst the Association. He, along with B.F. as a counterclaimant, alleged the\\n\\nAssociation violated state and federal anti-discrimination laws. In amended\\n\\npleadings that followed, the Association added B.F. as a defendant, and\\n\\ndefendants asserted the Association had violated the LAD and the FHA.\\n\\nDefendants claimed that Luna was a support animal, “as recognized by the”\\n\\nNew Jersey Division on Civil Rights, not a pet, and that “proof of the [dog’s]\\n\\nmedical necessity” had been provided to the Association.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       6\\n       On May 29, 2019, the chancery court entered an order to bifurcate the\\n\\nproceedings. The order directed that the Association’s claims “regarding\\n\\nallowing the dog to remain in the condominium [would] remain in Chancery.”\\n\\nAfter that trial was completed, “[t]he damages portion of the case [would be]\\n\\ntransferred to the Law Division.” The court also granted K.P. and B.F. “leave\\n\\nto amend their counterclaim to request a trial by jury.” They requested a jury\\n\\ntrial for the LAD and FHA claims in a second amended counterclaim.\\n\\n      The chancery judge conducted a bench trial in September and October\\n\\n2020 and heard testimony from an officer of the Association, multiple medical\\n\\nexperts, defendants, and family members.\\n\\n      John Quinesso, president of the Association’s board, testified that the pet\\n\\npolicy had been in place since 2006 and that its weight restriction was\\n\\ndesigned to prevent damage to landscaping and avoid noise complaints.\\n\\nQuinesso explained the policy does not mention ESAs, and the community\\n\\ntreats “any domesticated animal living with a person” as “a pet.” Since the\\n\\npolicy went into effect, the Association granted two requests for ESAs.\\n\\n      Kathryn Rim, a licensed clinical social worker, testified by way of a\\n\\nvideo-recorded deposition. Rim began treating B.F. in 2016 based on a\\n\\nrecommendation from B.F.’s psychiatrist. Two to three years earlier, B.F. had\\n\\nbeen diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. Based on Rim’s observations, she\\n\\n                                       7\\n added panic disorder and acute post-traumatic stress disorder to the diagnosis.\\n\\nShe also noted that B.F. had “ADD or ADHD.”\\n\\n       When the two first met, B.F. had been in a car accident that\\n\\n“triggered . . . a depressive episode” during which she “experienc[ed] suicidal\\n\\nthoughts.” In 2017 and 2018, she went through “a few depressive episodes”\\n\\nmarked by periods of stability in between -- “typical of [a] bipolar” disorder,\\n\\nwhich is “marked by up-and-down cycles.” The episodes ranged from two\\n\\nweeks to one month. Throughout that time, B.F. took medication that\\n\\nmitigated but did “not fix” her symptoms.\\n\\n       Rim has never prescribed an ESA or known a doctor to do so. She\\n\\nexplained it is more common for patients to get an ESA on their own. Rim\\n\\nadded that ESAs can have “a huge benefit” for people diagnosed with mental\\n\\nhealth disorders because the animals can decrease symptoms and improve the\\n\\nowner’s “quality of life” and “ability to function day to day.”\\n\\n       After getting Luna, B.F. told Rim the dog “was helping with . . . her\\n\\nemotional state.” Rim explained that B.F.’s depressive episodes were shorter\\n\\nand “more mild to moderate” than before. Rim also noticed an improvement\\n\\nin her “ability to cope with stressors.” For example, B.F. used to hide in a\\n\\ncloset to cope when she became depressed; with Luna, B.F. spent “less[] time”\\n\\nin “the closet, if at all.”\\n\\n                                        8\\n       Rim explained that the bond between the patient and the animal was\\n\\n“extremely important . . . for there to be emotional support.” B.F. grew up\\n\\nwith a larger dog that provided her with emotional support and described an\\n\\n“immediate bond and connection” with Luna “when she met her.”\\n\\n      Rim observed that B.F.’s “prognosis is good in the sense that her\\n\\ncondition can continue to be managed.” But “if her dog were to be taken away\\n\\nat this point . . . , that would be very detrimental to her mental health.” Rim\\n\\nadded that B.F.’s “ability to cope with change is really, really challenging, . . .\\n\\nand given [her] history of suicidality, depressive episodes, and . . . diagnosis of\\n\\nbipolar, [removing the ESA] could trigger all of those things.”\\n\\n      Dr. Jo-Ann M. Cannon, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist, also\\n\\ntestified by way of a video-recorded deposition. Cannon met with B.F. and\\n\\nexamined her medical records. Cannon testified that B.F. “has a long history\\n\\nof mental illness” dating “back to the seventh grade.” She experienced severe\\n\\nanxiety and depression at a young age and was placed on medication then.\\n\\nAccording to Cannon, B.F.’s diagnoses include bipolar disorder, post-traumatic\\n\\nstress disorder, and attention deficit disorder, for which she takes various\\n\\nmedications including two mood stabilizers, “an anti-depressant,” an “anti-\\n\\npsychotic,” and “Adderall for her ADD.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         9\\n       Like Rim, Cannon explained that B.F. “doesn’t respond well to change”\\n\\nand “decompensates” when there is stress. Even while on medication, her\\n\\nmedical issues affect her ability to function. On a bad day, Cannon noted, B.F.\\n\\nwill “lock herself in a closet and . . . stay there for hours in order to calm\\n\\nherself down in a calm environment.”\\n\\n      Cannon testified that B.F. “could not be alone in the condo” “[b]efore\\n\\ngetting Luna.” Although B.F. still suffers from depression and anxiety, she is\\n\\nnow “comfortable staying alone in the condo as long as she has Luna with\\n\\nher.” When B.F. is “panicking or decompressing,” “the dog will sit in the\\n\\ncloset with her for hours” and “lick[] her face when she cries.” In Cannon’s\\n\\nopinion, Luna “keeps [B.F.] stable.”\\n\\n      Cannon explained that the impetus for getting an ESA “always come[s]\\n\\nfrom the patient,” not the clinician. She had not heard of clinicians prescribing\\n\\nESAs but has written letters of support for ESAs when an animal “alleviate[s]\\n\\nsome of the symptoms” the disabled person is “experiencing.”\\n\\n      Cannon opined that Luna helps B.F. enjoy her daily life in the\\n\\ncondominium unit. If Luna were no longer allowed to live with B.F., Cannon\\n\\ntestified that she thought B.F. would decompensate, “which could be\\n\\npotentially dangerous because . . . she has suicidal ideation on and off.”\\n\\nWithout Luna, Cannon believed B.F’s “condition would deteriorate.”\\n\\n                                         10\\n       Natalie Eisenhower, the psychiatric nurse practitioner who treated B.F.,\\n\\nalso testified. Eisenhower monitored and helped manage B.F.’s medications.\\n\\nEisenhower did not prescribe or recommend that B.F. get an ESA but wrote\\n\\ntwo letters of support at B.F.’s request. Eisenhower testified that she thought\\n\\nan ESA “would benefit” B.F. because the animal helped lessen her symptoms\\n\\nand “help[ed] her cope when she does have . . . episodes.”\\n\\n      The Association called Dr. Mark Siegert, a clinical and forensic\\n\\npsychologist, as an expert witness. Siegert reviewed B.F.’s available medical\\n\\nrecords, evaluated her in person, and administered two psychological tests. He\\n\\nconcluded that B.F. “actually suffer[s] from some mental illness.” His\\n\\n“diagnostic impression” of B.F. was that she had “bipolar II disorder, major\\n\\ndepressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, somatoform disorder,\\n\\ncompulsive personality disorder, and borderline personality type.”\\n\\n      Siegert, however, did not find “any substantial limitation . . . of any\\n\\nmajor life activities or bodily functions” because of B.F.’s mental illness.\\n\\nAlthough he noted that depression and panic attacks “restrain[]” B.F. “at the\\n\\nmoment,” Siegert found that she is “able to get back together” and has\\n\\n“done . . . quite well through most of her life.” In his opinion, her restrictions\\n\\nwere not substantial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        11\\n       Siegert noted that B.F.’s treating psychiatrist had not prescribed or\\n\\nrecommended an ESA for B.F., “[w]hich is consistent with what [he]\\n\\nbelieve[d].” He concluded that Luna had not “directly ameliorated” any of\\n\\nB.F.’s symptoms. In his opinion, B.F. “did not require a dog to have equal use\\n\\nand enjoyment of the [condominium] unit.”\\n\\n      B.F., K.P., and B.F.’s parents testified as well. B.F. explained that she\\n\\nhas struggled with mental health issues since middle school. She identified her\\n\\ndiagnoses, medications, treatment providers, and ongoing symptoms.\\n\\n      B.F. noted that she raised the idea of an emotional support animal with\\n\\nher therapist. She had a larger dog while growing up, which she always found\\n\\n“comforting.” Smaller dogs did not provide her “with that same level of . . .\\n\\nrelaxation.” Because they were “loud and yappy,” they gave her “more\\n\\nanxiety” instead. She said that she bonded with Luna -- a larger, quiet dog --\\n\\nright away.\\n\\n      B.F. testified that Luna provides “a really great deal of comfort to” her.\\n\\nBy way of examples, B.F. explained that Luna lies with her in the closet when\\n\\nshe is “going through . . . an episode” and “lick[s] away [her] tears.” B.F.\\n\\nadded that her symptoms have “dramatically . . . decreased . . . in length” and\\n\\nfrequency since she has had Luna.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       12\\n       K.P. confirmed that Luna has had a positive impact on B.F.’s behavior.\\n\\nHer parents corroborated B.F.’s account of her mental health issues and\\n\\nlikewise commented on the positive effect Luna has had on B.F.\\n\\n                                       C.\\n\\n      The chancery court issued its ruling in early December 2020. It\\n\\ndismissed defendants’ claims under the LAD and FHA but allowed Luna to\\n\\nremain with B.F. on narrow equitable grounds.\\n\\n      The court found that although B.F. “does suffer from various forms of\\n\\nmental disturbances,” she is not “handicapped or disabled” within the meaning\\n\\nof the LAD and FHA. In support of that finding, the court noted that B.F. had\\n\\ngraduated with honors and received positive reviews from her employer; “[n]o\\n\\naspect of her diagnosed conditions . . . prevented her from the normal exercise\\n\\nof any bodily or mental functions.” The court also observed that no one had\\n\\nprescribed an ESA for B.F. For those reasons, the court dismissed the LAD\\n\\nand FHA claims and did not award any damages to defendants.\\n\\n      The chancery court made additional findings that supported its equitable\\n\\nremedy. Even though it found “there was no proof at all that [B.F.] need[ed] a\\n\\ndog to alleviate her conditions,” the court “believe[d]” that B.F. “ha[d]\\n\\ndemonstrated that this dog has acted to relieve certain symptoms of her mental\\n\\nhealth conditions either by shortening or lessening them.” The court noted that\\n\\n                                       13\\n Luna “allowed [B.F.] to remain in the . . . unit without [K.P.], which she\\n\\ncouldn’t do before she had the dog,” and “help[ed] her to lessen or shorten the\\n\\nextent of the episode[s].” The court emphasized that because “this particular\\n\\ndog, not any other dog, just this dog . . . offers her comfort and seems to assist\\n\\nher in lessening her episodes,” and because the dog “ha[d] not been at all\\n\\ndisruptive,” B.F. could “keep this dog.”\\n\\n      Finally, the court vacated its prior order to transfer the damage claims to\\n\\nthe Law Division. Because it found no violation of the LAD or FHA, the court\\n\\nexplained there was “no damage portion left to be determined by a jury.” In a\\n\\nwritten order, the court directed each party to pay its own counsel fees.\\n\\n      Plaintiff appealed and argued the trial court erred in failing to enforce\\n\\nthe Association’s rules and regulations and allowing Luna to stay. Defendants\\n\\ncross-appealed. They challenged the chancery court’s finding that B.F. was not\\n\\ndisabled and therefore not entitled to an accommodation, damages, or\\n\\nattorneys’ fees under the LAD and FHA.\\n\\n      A divided Appellate Division panel modified and affirmed the trial\\n\\ncourt’s judgment. The majority found that “the judge acted within her\\n\\ndiscretion in fashioning an equitable remedy suitable for the particular facts of\\n\\nthe case.” The appellate majority concluded the decision “was supported by\\n\\nB.F.’s unrebutted attachment to Luna and the emotional support she receives\\n\\n                                        14\\n from Luna”; “[o]n the other side of the scale, the Association presented no\\n\\nevidence that Luna caused any problems.”\\n\\n      The majority, however, noted that the trial court misinterpreted the\\n\\nstatute when it found B.F. was not disabled. To establish a disability under the\\n\\nLAD, the majority explained, it is not necessary to demonstrate that a mental\\n\\ndisability “prevents the typical exercise of any bodily or mental functions”; the\\n\\nstatute provides an alternative way to establish a disability “by accepted\\n\\nclinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.” (citing N.J.S.A. 10:5-5(q)).\\n\\nUnder that standard, the majority concluded that “the unrefuted medical\\n\\nevidence established that B.F. was disabled” under the LAD.\\n\\n      The majority found both “that B.F. suffer[ed] from various psychological\\n\\ndisorders, and [that] B.F.’s mental health professionals testified that Luna\\n\\nameliorated certain symptoms of B.F.’s disability.” But the majority could not\\n\\n“say that the [chancery] judge erred when she found there was insufficient\\n\\nproof that having a dog that exceeded the weight limit in the Association’s pet\\n\\npolicy ‘was necessary to afford [B.F.] an equal opportunity to use and enjoy’\\n\\nthe condominium unit.” (quoting Oras v. Hous. Auth. of Bayonne, \\n373 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 302\\n, 312 (App. Div. 2004)). Critical to its analysis, the majority\\n\\nobserved that no medical or mental health professional recommended or\\n\\nprescribed an ESA. The majority also observed there was no medical evidence\\n\\n                                       15\\n that B.F. needed a dog larger than thirty pounds. As a result, the majority\\n\\nfound “the Association was relieved of its obligation to provide the requested\\n\\naccommodation.” (citing Oras, \\n373 N.J. Super. at 317\\n).\\n\\n      The dissent agreed that defendants’ claims under the LAD and FHA\\n\\nshould be dismissed. “With that finding,” it explained, “there was nothing left\\n\\nfor the trial judge to do.” The dissent therefore found the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion in “awarding defendants a remedy when [there was] no wrong to\\n\\nright.”\\n\\n      Plaintiff appealed as of right based on the dissent, pursuant to Rule 2:2-\\n\\n1(a)(2). The Court granted defendants’ petition for certification. \\n254 N.J. 500\\n\\n\\n(2023). The Court also granted leave to appear as friends of the court to the\\n\\nAttorney General and the New Jersey Association for Justice (NJAJ).\\n\\n                                        II.\\n\\n      B.F. and K.P. contend that the Appellate Division used an improper\\n\\nstandard to determine when a disabled person is entitled to an emotional\\n\\nsupport animal. Defendants submit that because B.F. presented proof that she\\n\\nis disabled and that Luna ameliorated the symptoms of her disability, and\\n\\nbecause no complaints had been lodged against Luna, the court’s inquiry\\n\\nshould have ended there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        16\\n       B.F. and K.P. also assert that the trial court properly exercised its\\n\\nequitable powers to fashion a remedy that allowed B.F. to keep Luna. If B.F.\\n\\nand K.P. prevail, they maintain the issue of damages should proceed in the\\n\\nLaw Division before a jury.\\n\\n      The Association argues that its rules are valid and enforceable. Under\\n\\nthe business judgment rule, the Association contends the rules should apply\\n\\nhere. The Association also maintains that it did not violate the LAD. Because\\n\\nit did not commit any wrong against defendants, the Association argues, the\\n\\ntrial court abused its discretion in permitting Luna to stay in the condominium\\n\\nunit. According to the Association, both law and equity require that Luna be\\n\\nremoved.\\n\\n      The Association agrees with defendants that, if the Appellate Division’s\\n\\njudgment is reversed, a jury trial will be needed to adjudicate defendants’ LAD\\n\\nclaims.\\n\\n      The Attorney General, on behalf of the Division on Civil Rights, argues\\n\\n“[t]his Court should hold that (1) B.F. has a disability under the LAD; (2) this\\n\\nparticular accommodation was ‘necessary,’ even if this ESA was not prescribed\\n\\nby a doctor; and (3) housing providers must engage in a good-faith process\\n\\nwith residents who request such an accommodation.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        17\\n       The Attorney General submits that the Appellate Division misapplied the\\n\\nstandard to determine whether the requested accommodation was “necessary.”\\n\\nUnder the LAD, the Attorney General contends, “[a]n accommodation is\\n\\nnecessary . . . if the individual with the disability can show the accommodation\\n\\nalleviates the effects of her disability to afford her the equal opportunity to use\\n\\nand enjoy her dwelling.”\\n\\n      NJAJ argues that the Appellate Division misinterpreted the appropriate\\n\\nlegal standard in light of the remedial purpose of the LAD and its\\n\\nimplementing regulation, N.J.A.C. 13:13-3.4(f)(2). NJAJ also contends that it\\n\\nwas clear error to find there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the\\n\\nnecessity of the requested accommodation.\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      B.F. and K.P. contend the Association has violated their rights under\\n\\nstate and federal law. New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination is designed to\\n\\neradicate discrimination in our society. Nini v. Mercer Cnty. Cmty. Coll., \\n202\\n\\nN.J. 98\\n, 115 (2010). The Legislature specifically directed that this remedial\\n\\nlaw “shall be liberally construed.” N.J.S.A. 10:5-3.\\n\\n      Among other safeguards, the LAD prohibits discrimination in housing\\n\\non account of a person’s disability. N.J.S.A. 10:5-12(g)(2) states that\\n\\n                                        18\\n             [i]t shall be . . . an unlawful discrimination . . .

Est. of Nicolas v. Ocean\\n\\nPlaza Condo. Ass’n, Inc., \\n388 N.J.

Discriminatory housing\\n\\npractices include “a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,\\n\\npolicies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary\\n\\n                                       20\\n to afford [a person who is handicapped] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a\\n\\ndwelling.” \\n42 U.S.C. § 3604\\n(f)(3)(B); see also \\n24 C.F.R. § 966.7\\n(a) (applying\\n\\nthe same principle to lease and grievance procedures).\\n\\n      The LAD must be construed in a way that “permit[s] the Division on\\n\\nCivil Rights . . . to qualify as a ‘certified agency’ within the meaning of the\\n\\nFederal Fair Housing Amendments Act.” N.J.S.A. 10:5-9.2. To qualify, HUD\\n\\nrequires that the LAD provide rights, procedures, and remedies “that are\\n\\nsubstantially equivalent to those provided in the federal Fair Housing Act.” \\n24\\n\\nC.F.R. § 115.201\\n(a).\\n\\n      The LAD, in turn, defines “disability” more broadly than the FHA does.\\n\\nUnder the FHA, the correlative term “handicap” 2 means “(1) a physical or\\n                                                  1F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmental impairment which substantially limits one or more of [a] person’s\\n\\nmajor life activities, (2) a record of having such an impairment, or (3) being\\n\\nregarded as having such an impairment.” \\n42 U.S.C. § 3602\\n(h). That definition\\n\\nmirrors the language in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \\n42 U.S.C.\\n\\n§ 12102\\n(1) (defining “disability”). State law, by contrast, does not include any\\n\\nrequirement that a disability “result in substantial limitation of a major life\\n\\nactivity.” Tynan, \\n351 N.J. Super. at 397\\n. As a result, the LAD “has been\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  In 2003, the New Jersey Legislature substituted the word “disability” for all\\nreferences to “handicap” in the LAD.

In Oras, the court considered a claim that a\\n\\ndisabled tenant brought under the FHA and the LAD. \\n373 N.J. Super. at 306,\\n\\n310-11\\n. The tenant argued that the Bayonne Housing Authority “discriminated\\n\\nagainst him by not providing . . . a handicap-accessible apartment, and by not\\n\\npermitting him to keep a dog that he claim[ed] assisted him with his daily\\n\\nactivities.” \\nId. at 306\\n. The dog weighed more than the Authority’s pet policy\\n\\nallowed. \\nId. at 307-08\\n.\\n\\n      To assess the claims, the appellate court noted the disabled tenant had\\n\\nthe initial burden to show the requested accommodation “was necessary to\\n\\nafford him . . . an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” \\nId.\\n at 312\\n\\n(citing Lapid-Laurel, L.L.C. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Scotch Plains, \\n284\\n\\nF.3d 442\\n, 457 (3d Cir. 2002)). The burden of proof then shifts to the housing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        22\\n provider “to show that the requested accommodation is or was unreasonable.”\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n        Notwithstanding its pet policy, the Oras court explained, the Authority\\n\\nwas “obligated to accommodate” the tenant’s “disability ‘to the extent\\n\\nnecessary to provide the handicapped person with an opportunity to use and\\n\\noccupy the dwelling unit equal to a non-handicapped person.’” Id. at 314\\n\\n(quoting \\n24 C.F.R. § 966.7\\n(a) and citing N.J.A.C. 13:13-3.4(f)(2)).\\n\\n        Both relevant issues -- “[w]hether a pet is of sufficient assistance to a\\n\\ntenant” and whether the accommodation sought is unreasonable -- involve fact-\\n\\nsensitive inquiries.

See N.J.A.C. 13:13-3.4(c) (“It is unlawful for any person\\nto fail or refuse to show, rent or lease any real property to a person because he\\nor she is a person with a disability who is accompanied by a guide or service\\ndog or animal.”). “Service dog[s]” are “trained to the requirements of a person\\nwith a disability including . . . minimal protection work, rescue work, pulling a\\nwheelchair or retrieving dropped items.” N.J.S.A. 10:5-5(dd).\\n                                         24\\n request a reasonable accommodation for [an] ESA.” \\nIbid.\\n If the “disability\\n\\nand disability-related need for an ESA are not obvious or otherwise known, [a]\\n\\nhousing provider may request reliable documentation from [the person’s]\\n\\ntreating health care professional.” \\nIbid.\\n The housing provider, in turn, “must\\n\\nconduct an individualized assessment of [the] request and may deny [it] if\\n\\nallowing an ESA would create an undue burden on its operations.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      In 2020, HUD issued guidance in the form of best practices for housing\\n\\nproviders to comply with the FHA as they assess “requests for reasonable\\n\\naccommodations to keep animals in housing.” U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb.\\n\\nDev., Assessing a Person’s Request to Have an Animal as a Reasonable\\n\\nAccommodation Under the Fair Housing Act at 1 (HUD Guidance) (Jan. 28,\\n\\n2020), https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/HUDAsstAnimalNC1-\\n\\n28-2020.pdf. The HUD Guidance plainly states that “[a]ssistance animals are\\n\\nnot pets.” Id. at 3. The guidance extends beyond service animals to animals\\n\\nthat “provide therapeutic emotional support for individuals with disabilities”\\n\\nand “alleviate[] at least one identified symptom or effect of a physical or\\n\\nmental impairment.” Id. at 3, 19. Neither type of animal is subject to pet rules\\n\\nor policies. Id. at 14. “Thus, housing providers may not limit the breed or size\\n\\nof a dog used as a service animal or support animal just because of the size or\\n\\nbreed . . . .” Ibid. But providers can refuse a request “if the specific animal\\n\\n                                       25\\n poses a direct threat” “to the health or safety of other[s]” “that cannot be\\n\\neliminated or reduced to an acceptable level.” Id. at 13.\\n\\n      According to HUD, “resident[s] may request a reasonable\\n\\naccommodation either before or after acquiring [an] assistance animal.” Id. at\\n\\n8. If the request lacks information about a person’s disability or the need for\\n\\nan animal, HUD encourages housing providers “to engage in a good-faith\\n\\ndialogue with the requestor called the ‘interactive process.’” Id. at 14. And if\\n\\na request is denied because “it would impose a fundamental alteration to the\\n\\nnature of the provider’s operations or . . . an undue financial and\\n\\nadministrative burden, the housing provider should [similarly] engage in the\\n\\ninteractive process to discuss” alternative ways to accommodate a person’s\\n\\n“disability-related needs.” Id. at 15.\\n\\n      The Division echoes HUD’s guidance in its brief. The Division submits\\n\\nthat “[h]ousing providers may not summarily reject a request.” Instead, they\\n\\nshould “engage in a good-faith discussion with a tenant or resident . . . like the\\n\\n‘interactive process’ for accommodations in employment.” (citing Victor v.\\n\\nState, \\n203 N.J. 383\\n, 414-15 (2010) (discussing an employer’s obligation to\\n\\nengage in an interactive process in the employment context); Richter, 246 N.J.\\n\\nat 543 (same)).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         26\\n                                        D.\\n\\n      In short, in a case like this, a resident of a condominium complex is\\n\\nentitled under state and federal law to request an accommodation to a pet\\n\\npolicy in order to keep an emotional support animal. The individual must first\\n\\ndemonstrate they have a disability under the LAD. In addition, they must\\n\\nshow that the requested accommodation may be necessary to afford them an\\n\\n“equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” N.J.A.C. 13:13-3.4(f)(2).\\n\\nThe housing provider then has the burden to prove the requested\\n\\naccommodation is unreasonable.\\n\\n      As part of that process, the parties should engage in a good-faith,\\n\\ninteractive dialogue to exchange information, consider alternative options, and\\n\\nattempt to resolve or narrow any issues. If that collaborative effort fails and\\n\\nlitigation follows, courts will inevitably need to balance the need for, and\\n\\nbenefits of, the requested accommodation against the costs and administrative\\n\\nburdens it presents to determine whether the accommodation is reasonable.\\n\\nSee Oras, \\n373 N.J. Super. at 316-17\\n.\\n-------\\n\\n                                       IV.\\n\\n      We now return to the facts of this case and consider them under the\\n\\nappropriate legal framework. In light of the posture of this case, which we\\n\\ndiscuss later, we do so largely to offer guidance for the proper approach to\\n\\n                                       27\\n discrimination claims of this type. We rely on the record developed at the\\n\\nbench trial in the Chancery Division for the following discussion.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      The threshold question in an LAD case is whether the person seeking an\\n\\naccommodation has a disability under the statute. That issue is no longer in\\n\\ndispute. In a written submission to the Court after oral argument, the\\n\\nAssociation stated that “B.F.’s LAD disability is the law of the case.” We\\n\\ntherefore consider the point only briefly.\\n\\n      The chancery court found that B.F. did not have a disability because “no\\n\\naspect of her diagnosed conditions . . . prevented her from the normal exercise\\n\\nof any bodily or mental functions.” In so ruling, the court focused on the first\\n\\nof two ways to establish a mental, psychological, or developmental disability.\\n\\nSee N.J.S.A. 10:5-5(q) (a disability “which prevents the typical exercise of any\\n\\nbodily or mental functions”). The Appellate Division properly looked to the\\n\\nstatute’s second ground: “any mental, psychological, or developmental\\n\\ndisability . . . which . . . is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by\\n\\naccepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      The record amply supports the Appellate Division’s conclusion that B.F.\\n\\nsatisfied the second ground. Experts on both sides diagnosed B.F. with\\n\\npsychological disabilities. The Association’s expert, Dr. Siegert, testified that\\n\\n                                        28\\n B.F. suffered from “bipolar II disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized\\n\\nanxiety disorder, somatoform disorder, compulsive personality disorder, and\\n\\nborderline personality type.” Other witnesses testified that B.F. suffered from\\n\\npost-traumatic stress, attention deficit disorder, and panic disorder as well. 4 3F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      As noted earlier, the proofs about B.F.’s medical condition were\\n\\ndeveloped at trial. The Association, instead, could have asked for more\\n\\ninformation in response to B.F.’s initial request for an accommodation. HUD’s\\n\\nGuidance is instructive on this point. Housing providers can ask individuals to\\n\\nprovide information that confirms they have a disability and need a support\\n\\nanimal, such as a determination from a government agency or a letter from a\\n\\nhealth care professional. HUD Guidance at 10; see also Viscik, \\n173 N.J. at 16\\n\\n\\n(requiring medical evidence when a disability “is not readily apparent”); DCR\\n\\nGuidance (same). But “medical records or a medical examination cannot be\\n\\nrequired.” HUD Guidance at 14.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      In addition to establishing their disability, residents have the initial\\n\\nburden to demonstrate the accommodation they seek is necessary. B.F. must\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n   Whether B.F. disclosed her medical condition on a firearms application form\\nis not relevant to the legal issues this appeal presents. The Attorney General,\\nappearing as amicus, can take appropriate steps to address whether B.F. should\\nbe allowed to purchase and own firearms today.\\n                                          29\\n show that the accommodation to the Association’s pet policy “may be\\n\\nnecessary to afford” her an “equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.”\\n\\nN.J.A.C. 13:13-3.4(f)(2) (emphasis added).\\n\\n      The necessity requirement “asks whether the requested accommodation\\n\\nameliorates the disability’s effects.” Bhogaita, \\n765 F.3d at 1289\\n; see also\\n\\nAnderson, 798 F.3d at 361 (“Equal use and enjoyment of a dwelling are\\n\\nachieved when an accommodation ameliorates the effects of the disability such\\n\\nthat the disabled individual can use and enjoy his or her residence as a non-\\n\\ndisabled person could.”); Oras, \\n373 N.J. Super. at 315\\n (same). In essence, the\\n\\nquestion is whether the accommodation will alleviate at least one symptom of\\n\\nthe disability, not whether the accommodation will cure or eliminate the\\n\\ndisability.\\n\\n      Here as well, trial testimony provided a record for the chancery court.\\n\\nRim testified that Luna helped with B.F.’s emotional state. Her depressive\\n\\nepisodes were shorter and more “mild to moderate” than before, and Luna\\n\\n“helped improve [B.F.’s] ability to cope with day-to-day things” and stressors.\\n\\nIf Luna “were to be taken away,” Rim opined, “that would be very detrimental\\n\\nto [B.F.’s] health.”\\n\\n      Dr. Cannon testified similarly. She observed that although B.F. “still\\n\\nsuffered from bouts of depression and anxiety,” the episodes “were much less\\n\\n                                       30\\n severe,” and Luna “keeps [B.F.] stable.” Cannon opined that Luna “helps\\n\\n[B.F.] enjoy . . . daily living in [the] condo” and that, if Luna were taken away,\\n\\nB.F. would decompensate -- “which could be potentially dangerous” -- and\\n\\n“her condition would deteriorate.”\\n\\n      Dr. Siegert reached a different conclusion. He concluded that Luna had\\n\\nnot “directly ameliorated” any of B.F.’s symptoms and that B.F. “did not\\n\\nrequire a dog to have equal use and enjoyment of the [condominium] unit.”\\n\\n      After hearing all the evidence, the chancery court made these findings:\\n\\n               [T]he Court does believe that [B.F.] has demonstrated\\n               that this dog has acted to relieve certain symptoms of\\n               her mental health conditions either by shortening or\\n               lessening them. The dog has also allowed [B.F.] to\\n               remain in the . . . unit without [K.P], which she couldn’t\\n               do before she had the dog. She says the dog sits next\\n               to her if she has an episode in the closet, which helps\\n               her to lessen or shorten the extent of the episode.\\n\\n               ....\\n\\n               [B]ecause this particular dog offers [B.F.] comfort and\\n               seems to assist her in lessening her episodes, the Court\\n               is making an allowance for [B.F.] to keep this dog.\\n\\n               (emphasis added).\\n\\n      The Appellate Division similarly observed that “B.F.’s mental health\\n\\nprofessionals testified that Luna ameliorated certain symptoms of B.F.’s\\n\\ndisability.”\\n\\n\\n                                          31\\n       Both the chancery court and the Appellate Division emphasized that no\\n\\nmental health professional had recommended or prescribed an emotional\\n\\nsupport animal for B.F. The LAD does not require that. As noted earlier, to\\n\\nsatisfy the necessity prong, B.F. had to show that the accommodation she\\n\\nrequested -- the support animal -- would enhance her “quality of life by\\n\\nameliorating” one or more “effects of the disability,” Oras, \\n373 N.J. Super. at\\n\\n315\\n, and thereby afford B.F. the “equal opportunity to use and enjoy [the]\\n\\ndwelling,” N.J.A.C. 13:13-3.4(f)(2). For the same reason, B.F. was not\\n\\nrequired to establish a specific need for a dog that exceeded the Association’s\\n\\nweight limit.\\n\\n      Neither B.F. nor K.P. notified the Association in advance of B.F.\\n\\nacquiring an emotional support animal. Although residents can request an\\n\\naccommodation before or after getting a support animal, see HUD Guidance at\\n\\n8, residents who act on their own run the risk of losing the animal if they\\n\\ncannot make the required showing later. When possible, it is preferable to\\n\\nengage in a collaborative conversation in advance. At the same time, we\\n\\nrecognize the issue is not a simple one because residents may not know in\\n\\nadvance whether a particular ESA will help ameliorate their symptoms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       32\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      In an LAD case, the burden then shifts to the housing provider to prove\\n\\nthe requested accommodation was unreasonable. That question involves a\\n\\nfact-specific weighing of the relevant costs and benefits. Oras, \\n373 N.J. Super.\\n\\nat 315\\n. As noted earlier, housing providers are not obligated “to do everything\\n\\nhumanly possible to accommodate a disabled person.” \\nIbid.\\n We agree with\\n\\nthe Division that the proper inquiry considers whether “allowing . . . an ESA\\n\\nwould fundamentally alter the housing provider’s operations or impose an\\n\\nundue financial or administrative burden on the housing provider.” DCR\\n\\nGuidance.\\n\\n      Whether the animal has been trained is not a relevant consideration\\n\\nbecause, “unlike service or guide animals, ESAs are not individually trained to\\n\\nperform specific tasks associated with their owner’s disability.” Ibid.; see also\\n\\nHUD Guidance at 1 (noting that “untrained animals” can “provide therapeutic\\n\\nemotional support”); Warren v. Delvista Towers Condo. Ass’n, Inc., \\n49 F.\\n\\nSupp. 3d 1082\\n, 1087 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (same).\\n\\n      Here, the chancery court found “that Luna ha[d] not been at all\\n\\ndisruptive,” “doesn’t bark,” and “is not a nuisance.” The court also noted\\n\\n“there have been no complaints about this dog.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       33\\n       As noted earlier, before a housing provider denies a request on\\n\\nreasonableness grounds, the parties should engage in good-faith, interactive\\n\\ndiscussions to evaluate the accommodation and explore possible alternatives.\\n\\nIn this case, no such discussion took place. Written exchanges at the outset\\n\\nhighlight firm positions from the start.\\n\\n                                           V.\\n\\n      We add one additional point. The chancery court dismissed defendants’\\n\\ndiscrimination claims. It granted relief on equitable grounds under its review\\n\\nof the Association’s breach of contract claim. But in a dispute like this, a\\n\\ncontract claim is ancillary to a discrimination claim. See Pressler & Verniero,\\n\\nCurrent N.J. Court Rules cmt. 2.2.1 on R. 4:35-1 (2024) (“[T]he determination\\n\\nof whether . . . claims are ancillary or primary depends on the overall posture\\n\\nof the litigation at its inception.”). Two examples help explain why.\\n\\n      If a resident has a disability and requests a necessary and reasonable\\n\\naccommodation, a condominium association cannot simply deny the request\\n\\nand prevail by relying on its pet policy. The matter would need to be\\n\\naddressed under the framework outlined above for discrimination claims.\\n\\n      On the other hand, if a resident falsely asserts that they are disabled, or\\n\\nhas no viable discrimination claim for some other reason, an association might\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           34\\n be able to prevail on a breach of contract claim. Either way, however, the\\n\\ncontract claim is secondary to the discrimination claim.\\n\\n      In this case, because B.F. has a disability, and Luna, as a support animal,\\n\\nis not subject to a pet policy, the dispute could not be resolved under a breach\\n\\nof contract theory. To the extent any judgment is based on the Association’s\\n\\nbreach of contract claim, it is therefore reversed. 5\\n                                                   4F\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      The proper starting point is defendants’ discrimination claim. In light of\\n\\nthe record in this case, the chancery court and Appellate Division should not\\n\\nhave dismissed B.F. and K.P.’s claim under the LAD and FHA. B.F. presented\\n\\nevidence of her need for an accommodation, which the Association disputes.\\n\\nWhether the Association has shown the accommodation sought is unreasonable\\n\\nis also disputed. Both of those inquiries are fact-sensitive. See Oras, \\n373 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. at 315-16\\n.\\n\\n      An additional fact raises a challenging question about the interplay\\n\\nbetween the Chancery and Law Division in this appeal. In their second\\n\\namended counterclaim, B.F. and K.P. requested a jury trial for their respective\\n\\n\\n5\\n  In light of our ruling, we do not address the Association’s arguments relating\\nto the business judgment rule. See Comm. for a Better Twin Rivers v. Twin\\nRivers Homeowners’ Ass’n, \\n192 N.J. 344\\n, 369 (2007) (“Pursuant to the\\nbusiness judgment rule, a homeowners’ association’s rules and regulations will\\nbe invalidated (1) if they are not authorized by statute or by the bylaws or\\nmaster deed, or (2) if the association’s actions are fraudulent, self-dealing or\\nunconscionable.” (quotation omitted)).\\n                                        35\\n claims under the LAD and FHA, and they sought a judgment, damages, costs,\\n\\nand injunctive relief. The bench trial conducted before the chancery court\\n\\naddressed the Association’s effort to enforce its pet policy -- not the LAD or\\n\\nFHA claims that awaited a jury trial. As a result, neither the chancery court’s\\n\\nfindings nor our observations in reviewing what has occurred to date can\\n\\nsubstitute for a jury determination on the discrimination counterclaim, which\\n\\nthe parties are entitled to.\\n\\n      We therefore remand the matter to the Law Division for further\\n\\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. At oral argument, the Association\\n\\nconceded that it was not contesting disability. In a letter submitted after\\n\\nargument, the Association stated that “B.F.’s LAD disability is the law of the\\n\\ncase.” That concession settles the threshold question in the discrimination\\n\\nclaim -- whether B.F. suffers from a disability. All of the other issues relating\\n\\nto the disability claim need to be resolved on remand.\\n\\n      There are ways the parties may streamline any future proceedings. For\\n\\nexample, they can withdraw the jury trial demand. -----\\n                                                  See R. 4:35-1(d) (requiring\\n\\nthe consent of all parties). They can also stipulate to evidence already\\n\\npresented at the bench trial before the chancery court.\\n\\n      We recognize this dispute began in 2018 and that a good deal of time,\\n\\nmoney, and energy has been expended since then. Nothing prevents the parties\\n\\n                                        36\\n from engaging in a good-faith, interactive process at this time to try to resolve\\n\\nthe ongoing dispute.\\n\\n      Because of the posture of the case, however, we cannot decide whether\\n\\nLuna can remain in the condominium complex. The outcome will be\\n\\ndetermined in the Law Division. Until then, the Association may not order\\n\\ndefendants to remove Luna from the property.\\n\\n                                       VI.\\n\\n      For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate\\n\\nDivision, vacate the dismissal of defendants’ counterclaim under the LAD and\\n\\nFHA, and remand to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with\\n\\nthis opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n     JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON, PIERRE-LOUIS, FASCIALE,\\nand NORIEGA join in CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER’s opinion.

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n        Christopher Maia v. IEW Construction Group (A-3-23) (088010)\\n\\nArgued January 3, 2024 -- Decided May 15, 2024\\n\\nFASCIALE, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       The Court considers whether plaintiffs’ claims as to conduct that preceded the\\neffective date of L. 2019, c. 212 (Chapter 212), which amended the Wage Payment\\nLaw (WPL) and the Wage and Hour Law (WHL), were properly dismissed.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs Christopher Maia and Sean Howarth were employed as laborers for\\ndefendant IEW Construction Group, which required them to perform “pre-shift” and\\n“post-shift” work. Maia joined IEW in April 2019. From early May 2019, he was\\nnot paid for his “pre-shift” and “post-shift” work. Howarth began working for IEW\\nin April 2020. He was never paid for “pre-shift” and “post-shift” responsibilities.\\nBoth Maia and Howarth were laid off in November 2021. In April 2022, they filed a\\nclass action complaint alleging in part that IEW violated the WHL and WPL.\\n\\n       The trial judge held that Chapter 212 does not apply retroactively and thus\\ndismissed plaintiffs’ claims for conduct that arose prior to Chapter 212’s effective\\ndate of August 6, 2019. The Appellate Division reversed. \\n475 N.J. Super. 44\\n, 48, 58\\n(App. Div. 2023). The Court granted leave to appeal. \\n255 N.J. 282\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Chapter 212 is to be applied prospectively to conduct that occurred on or\\nafter August 6, 2019 -- Chapter 212’s effective date -- not retroactively to conduct\\nthat occurred before that date. The trial judge properly dismissed the portions of the\\ncomplaint relying on Chapter 212 but arising from conduct prior to its effective date.\\n\\n1. As a threshold question, the Court considers the Appellate Division’s\\ndetermination that applying Chapter 212 to conduct occurring prior to its effective\\ndate is not a retroactive application, but rather prospective application of a statute\\n“to cases filed after its effective date.” See 475 N.J. Super. at 54-56. Both federal\\nlaw and state law determine whether a statute’s application is retroactive by focusing\\non any changes to the legal consequences created by a statute or amendment. In\\nLandgraf v. USI Film Products, the United States Supreme Court clarified that the\\nrelevant inquiry is “whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to\\nevents completed before its enactment.” \\n511 U.S. 244\\n, 269-70 (1994). (pp. 10-12)\\n                                          1\\n 2. The Court compares the relevant pre- and post-Chapter 212 provisions of the\\nWPL and WHL and finds that comparison telling. By adding liquidated damages\\nand a retaliation claim to both the WPL and WHL, attorneys’ fees to the WPL, and\\nby extending the statute of limitations in the WHL, Chapter 212 allows plaintiffs to\\nbring new claims with enhanced damages that were not previously available to\\nplaintiffs at the time their injuries occurred, thereby changing the legal consequences\\nof acts. The changes are not merely procedural; rather, they affect the duties and\\nliabilities involved. Chapter 212 attaches new legal consequences to events, and\\napplying the provisions of Chapter 212 to conduct “completed before its enactment”\\nwould therefore be retroactive application. W.S. v. Hildreth, \\n252 N.J. 506\\n (2023), on\\nwhich the Appellate Division relied, does not lead to a different conclusion because\\nthe amendments to procedural requirements at issue there did not create new\\ndamages, change the rights, responsibilities, claims, and defenses that parties can\\nassert, or implicate new legal burdens, unlike Chapter 212. (pp. 12-19)\\n\\n3. Because application of Chapter 212’s provisions to conduct prior to the statute’s\\neffective date would constitute retroactive application, the Court considers whether\\nsuch application is appropriate. New Jersey courts have long followed a general rule\\nthat favors prospective application of statutes. For a statute to apply retroactively,\\nboth parts of a two-part test must be satisfied: first, did the Legislature intend to\\ngive the statute retroactive application; and second, will retroactive application of\\nthe statute “result in either an unconstitutional interference with vested rights or a\\nmanifest injustice.” James v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., \\n216 N.J. 552\\n, 563 (2014). As to\\nthe first question, there are three circumstances that justify applying a statute\\nretroactively: (1) when the Legislature explicitly or implicitly expresses an intent\\nthat a law be retroactive; (2) when an amendment is ameliorative or curative; or\\n(3) when the parties’ expectations warrant retroactive application. (pp. 20-23)\\n\\n4. None of those three circumstances is present here. Indeed, the Legislature\\nexpressly stated in Section 14 of Chapter 212 that the new provisions “shall take\\neffect immediately,” a phrase that New Jersey Courts have repeatedly held to signal\\nprospective application. Because the first part of the retroactivity test reveals\\nnothing that warrants a departure from the presumptive prospectivity that applies to\\nsubstantive legislation, the Court does not reach the second part of the test. For\\nclaims based on conduct that occurred prior to August 6, 2019 -- Chapter 212’s\\neffective date -- plaintiffs cannot rely on Chapter 212. (pp. 23-25)\\n\\n    REVERSED.

See L. 2019, c. 212. Chapter 212 took effect on August 6,\\n\\n2019. See \\nid.\\n § 14. Some of the conduct on which plaintiffs base their\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       2\\n complaint preceded the effective date of Chapter 212; some followed that\\n\\neffective date.\\n\\n      In this appeal, we consider whether plaintiffs’ claims as to conduct that\\n\\npreceded Chapter 212’s effective date were properly dismissed by the trial\\n\\njudge, who found the amendments to be prospective, or whether the Appellate\\n\\nDivision properly reversed that judgment. We hold that the Legislature\\n\\nintended Chapter 212 to be prospective, not retroactive. Thus, Chapter 212\\n\\napplies to conduct occurring on or after its effective date of August 6, 2019,\\n\\nbut not to conduct occurring before then.\\n\\n      We therefore reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment, reinstate the\\n\\ntrial judge’s order partially dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint, and remand for\\n\\nfurther proceedings.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      In this appeal challenging an order entered under ----\\n                                                        Rule 4:6-2(e), we\\n\\nderive the pertinent facts from plaintiffs’ complaint. Defendant IEW\\n\\nConstruction Group (IEW) is a New Jersey-based company that performs\\n\\nconstruction services for the New Jersey Department of Transportation (DOT).\\n\\nPlaintiffs Christopher Maia and Sean Howarth were employed as laborers for\\n\\nIEW. IEW required plaintiffs to perform “pre-shift” and “post-shift” work\\n\\n                                        3\\n which included dropping off and picking up equipment at different worksites\\n\\nand yards operated by the DOT.\\n\\n      Maia joined IEW on or around April 7, 2019. From that date until early\\n\\nMay 2019, Maia was paid for the “pre-shift” and “post-shift” duties he\\n\\nperformed. Thereafter, Maia was not paid for his “pre-shift” and “post-shift”\\n\\nwork. Maia complained but IEW failed to remedy the situation. Maia\\n\\ncontinued to perform unpaid “pre-shift” and “post-shift” duties until November\\n\\n2021, when he was laid off.\\n\\n      Howarth began working for IEW on or around April 22, 2020. Howarth\\n\\nwas never paid for “pre-shift” and “post-shift” responsibilities during his\\n\\nemployment at IEW. Like Maia, Howarth performed unpaid “pre-shift” and\\n\\n“post-shift” duties until November 2021, when he was laid off.\\n\\n      In April 2022, Maia and Howarth filed a class action complaint alleging,\\n\\namong other allegations, that IEW violated the WHL and WPL. On those two\\n\\ncounts, plaintiffs seek unpaid wages to compensate and reimburse them, as\\n\\nwell as injunctive relief, liquidated damages, and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs\\n\\nsought class certification for a proposed class to consist of “all current and\\n\\nformer laborers and other similarly non-exempt positions employed by IEW in\\n\\nNew Jersey at any point in the six (6) years preceding the filing date of [the]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        4\\n Complaint who were not paid for pre-shift and post-shift duties performed.”\\n\\nThe question of class certification has not yet been addressed.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      IEW filed a Rule 4:6-2(e) motion to dismiss the part of plaintiffs’\\n\\ncomplaint seeking damages for conduct that occurred prior to Chapter 212’s\\n\\neffective date, arguing that Chapter 212 should be applied prospectively, not\\n\\nretroactively. Plaintiffs countered that they were not seeking retroactive\\n\\napplication of Chapter 212 but that, even if they were, the Legislature intended\\n\\nChapter 212 to be “curative” and therefore applied to conduct occurring prior\\n\\nto its effective date.\\n\\n      The trial judge agreed with IEW that Chapter 212 is not to be applied\\n\\nretroactively. Accordingly, the judge granted IEW’s motion and dismissed\\n\\nplaintiffs’ claims “for conduct that arose prior to August 6th, 2019,” but\\n\\nallowed those claims that arose after that date to “survive.” (emphasis\\n\\nadded). 1\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n   Specifically, the judge entered an order dismissing: (1) plaintiffs’ WHL\\nclaims arising prior to August 6, 2019, with prejudice; (2) plaintiffs’ WHL and\\nWPL claims for liquidated damages arising prior to August 6, 2019, with\\nprejudice; (3) plaintiffs’ WPL claim for attorneys’ fees with prejudice to the\\nextent the violations occurred prior to August 6, 2019; (4) plaintiffs’ WHL\\nclaim without prejudice to the extent it seeks to recover alleged unpaid\\nstraight-time wages; and (5) plaintiffs’ WPL claim with prejudice to the extent\\nit seeks to recover alleged unpaid overtime wages.\\n                                         5\\n       Plaintiffs moved for leave to appeal the order partially dismissing their\\n\\ncomplaint. The Appellate Division granted that motion, reversed the order,\\n\\nand remanded for further proceedings. Maia v. IEW Const. Grp., \\n475 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 44\\n, 48, 58 (App. Div. 2023). The Appellate Division concluded that\\n\\n“[t]he Legislature . . . did not tether Chapter 212’s remedies to the accrual date\\n\\nof an employee’s claim. It only prohibited an employee from recovering\\n\\ndamages for wages due more than six years prior to the ‘commencement’ of\\n\\nthe action.” \\nId. at 56\\n. Relying on W.S. v. Hildreth, \\n252 N.J. 506\\n (2023), the\\n\\nappellate court held that plaintiffs were entitled to the remedies available under\\n\\nthe WHL and WPL as of the date of their complaint because “[a]pplying the\\n\\nlaw in effect at the time a complaint is filed . . . is not applying a statute\\n\\nretroactively; it is applying a statute prospectively to cases filed after its\\n\\neffective date.” \\nId. at 54-56\\n (quoting Hildreth, 252 N.J. at 522).\\n\\n      Lastly, although it recognized that, unlike the WHL, the WPL never\\n\\nexpressly contained any “look-back” period, the Appellate Division\\n\\ndetermined that “the Legislature intended to provide ‘the same opportunity’ for\\n\\naggrieved workers to recover for violations of the WPL as it did for violations\\n\\nunder the WHL,” including having the same six-year period to recover\\n\\ndamages for those violations. Id. at 53-54.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          6\\n       We granted IEW’s motion for leave to appeal. \\n255 N.J. 282\\n (2023). We\\n\\nalso granted motions by the New Jersey Association for Justice (NJAJ), New\\n\\nJersey Civil Justice Institute (NJCJI), New Jersey Business & Industry\\n\\nAssociation (NJBIA), and Academy of New Jersey Management Attorneys\\n\\n(ANJMA) to appear as amici curiae; the National Employment Lawyers\\n\\nAssociation of New Jersey (NELA), which appeared as amicus curiae before\\n\\nthe Appellate Division, continued to participate.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n      IEW asks us to reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment and grant its\\n\\nmotion to partially dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint. IEW distinguishes Hildreth\\n\\nand argues that the appellate court’s decision impermissibly “had the effect” of\\n\\napplying Chapter 212 retroactively. As a result, IEW contends that the\\n\\nappellate court erred by failing to consider the “factors” governing retroactive\\n\\napplication which, according to IEW, cannot be satisfied. Specifically, IEW\\n\\nargues that Chapter 212 is not “curative,” and that the phrase utilized in\\n\\nChapter 212 -- “[t]his act shall take effect immediately” -- evidences an intent\\n\\nof prospective application.\\n\\n      Plaintiffs argue that the Appellate Division correctly relied on Hildreth\\n\\nand therefore the court’s decision should be affirmed. Plaintiffs reiterate that\\n\\nthey are not seeking retroactive application of Chapter 212 but instead ask us\\n\\n                                        7\\n to apply Chapter 212 as plainly written. Relying on legislative history,\\n\\nplaintiffs assert that the Legislature intended that those individuals who file a\\n\\ncomplaint on or after Chapter 212’s effective date be allowed to recover\\n\\nChapter 212’s remedies and utilize the WHL’s six-year “look-back” period. As\\n\\nan alternative to their prospectivity argument, plaintiffs contended at oral\\n\\nargument that the amendments are “curative” and therefore apply retroactively.\\n\\n      NJBIA, ANJMA, and NJCJI support IEW’s position, echoing many of\\n\\nIEW’s arguments, specifically that plaintiffs are impermissibly seeking\\n\\nretroactive application of Chapter 212. NJBIA adds that the WHL’s “look-\\n\\nback” period is a statute of repose and applying a statute of repose\\n\\nretroactively impermissibly creates or revives a cause of action. ANJMA\\n\\nargues that retroactivity is contrary to the Legislature’s intent and would result\\n\\nin manifest injustice and constitutional violations. NJCJI emphasizes that\\n\\nadopting plaintiffs’ arguments would undermine our precedent “protecting”\\n\\nagainst “unfair retroactive applications of new law[s].”\\n\\n      NJAJ and NELA support plaintiffs’ position that they are not seeking\\n\\nretroactive application of Chapter 212. Specifically, NJAJ argues that\\n\\nallowing plaintiffs to seek Chapter 212’s remedies for conduct occurring prior\\n\\nto its effective date not only advances the remedial purposes of the WHL and\\n\\nWPL, but also prevents the “absurd result” where the WHL’s full “six-year\\n\\n                                        8\\n look-back period would not take effect until August 6, 2025.” NELA argues\\n\\nthat the Legislature did not provide aggrieved employees with a “new cause of\\n\\naction” by enacting Chapter 212 -- “it merely expanded the remedies\\n\\navailable” to those who file a complaint on or after Chapter 212’s effective\\n\\ndate.\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n        A decision granting or denying a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\\n\\nclaim pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e) is reviewed de novo, affording no deference to\\n\\nthe trial judge’s legal conclusions. Dimitrakopoulos v. Borrus, Goldin, Foley,\\n\\nVignuolo, Hyman & Stahl, P.C., \\n237 N.J. 91\\n, 108 (2019). The test for a Rule\\n\\n4:6-2(e) motion is “whether a cause of action is ‘suggested’ by the facts.”\\n\\nPrinting Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., \\n116 N.J. 739\\n, 746 (1989)\\n\\n(quoting Velantzas v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., \\n109 N.J. 189\\n, 192 (1988)). But\\n\\nwhen a complaint fails to state a “claim that supports relief, and discovery will\\n\\nnot give rise to such a claim, the action should be dismissed.”\\n\\nDimitrakopoulos, \\n237 N.J. at 107\\n.\\n\\n        Here, the parties do not dispute whether the facts suggest a cause of\\n\\naction. Rather, they dispute whether Chapter 212 applies to all periods during\\n\\nwhich plaintiffs claim they were improperly denied wages. Resolution of that\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         9\\n dispute “is a purely legal question of statutory interpretation” that also requires\\n\\nde novo review. Johnson v. Roselle EZ Quick LLC, \\n226 N.J. 370\\n, 386 (2016).\\n\\n                                        IV.\\n\\n      We begin with the threshold question of whether applying Chapter 212\\n\\nto conduct occurring prior to its effective date is a true retroactive application\\n\\nof Chapter 212, or whether, as the Appellate Division concluded, the law in\\n\\neffect at the time the complaint was filed should control. See Maia, 475 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. at 54-56.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Both federal law and state law determine whether a statute’s application\\n\\nis retroactive by focusing on any changes to the legal consequences created by\\n\\na statute or statutory amendment. In Landgraf v. USI Film Products, \\n511 U.S.\\n\\n244\\n, 247 (1994), the United States Supreme Court decided whether the Civil\\n\\nRights Act of 1991, which amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964, applied to a\\n\\ncase pending on appeal when the 1991 Act was enacted. In 1989, after\\n\\nexperiencing approximately two years of sexual harassment by a co-worker,\\n\\nthe plaintiff commenced an action in federal court alleging violations of Title\\n\\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \\nId. at 247-48\\n. On November 21, 1991,\\n\\nwhile the plaintiff’s appeal was pending, President George H.W. Bush signed\\n\\nthe 1991 Act into law. \\nId. at 249\\n. The new Act created a right to recover\\n\\n                                        10\\n compensatory and punitive damages for certain violations of Title VII and\\n\\nallowed any party to demand a jury trial if such damages were sought. \\nId. at\\n\\n249-50, 252\\n.\\n\\n      The Supreme Court clarified that “[a] statute does not operate\\n\\n[retroactively] merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct\\n\\nantedating the statute’s enactment.” \\nId. at 269\\n. Instead, the Court observed,\\n\\nthe relevant inquiry is “whether the new provision attaches new legal\\n\\nconsequences to events completed before its enactment.” \\nId. at 270\\n (emphasis\\n\\nadded). The Court noted that the “application of new statutes passed after the\\n\\nevents in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations,” such as statutes\\n\\nthat affect the “propriety of prospective relief”; “statutes conferring or ousting\\n\\njurisdiction”; and “[c]hanges in procedural rules.” \\nId. at 273-75\\n. The Court\\n\\ndistinguished such situations from statutes that “would operate retroactively” -\\n\\n- i.e., statutes that “would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,\\n\\nincrease a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect\\n\\nto transactions already completed.” \\nId. at 280\\n.\\n\\n      Applying those principles to the case before it, the Supreme Court\\n\\ndetermined that application of the 1991 Act to conduct that occurred before it\\n\\ntook effect would impact the legal consequences faced by the parties; notably,\\n\\nthe “[r]etroactive imposition of punitive damages would raise a serious\\n\\n                                        11\\n constitutional question,” and the “introduction of a right to compensatory\\n\\ndamages” and “new damages” would create a “new legal burden” on the\\n\\nparties. \\nId. at 281-83\\n. The Court therefore held that, because it had “found no\\n\\nclear evidence of congressional intent that [the relevant section of the 1991\\n\\nAct] should apply to cases arising before its enactment,” the new provisions\\n\\ncould not be applied to the plaintiff’s claims. \\nId. at 286\\n.\\n\\n      This Court has likewise stressed that a “law is [retroactive] if it appl[ies]\\n\\nto events occurring before its enactment or if it changes the legal consequences\\n\\nof acts completed before its effective date.” In re Registrant J.D-F., \\n248 N.J.\\n\\n11\\n, 22 (2021) (second alteration in original) (emphases added) (quoting Riley\\n\\nv.

Hargrove v. Sleepy’s, LLC, \\n220 N.J. 289\\n, 302-03 (2015).\\n\\n      Under the WPL, “[n]o employer may withhold or divert any portion of\\n\\nan employee’s wages unless . . . [t]he employer is required . . . to do so by\\n\\nNew Jersey or United States law . . . or [t]he amounts withheld or diverted” are\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        12\\n for contributions, payments, fees, or deductions authorized by the employee\\n\\nand approved by the employer. N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.4.\\n\\n      Since its enactment, the WPL provided a private cause of action for\\n\\nviolations under N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.7, which states in pertinent part that “each\\n\\nand every employee with whom any agreement in violation of this section shall\\n\\nbe made by any such employer . . . shall have a right of civil action against any\\n\\nsuch employer for the full amount of his wages in any court of competent\\n\\njurisdiction.” Prior to the enactment of Chapter 212, N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.7\\n\\nallowed an aggrieved employee to bring a claim under the WPL limited solely\\n\\nto recovery of the full amount of wages improperly withheld by the employer.\\n\\nL. 1965, c. 173 § 7.\\n\\n      In addition to the cause of action for recovery under N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.7,\\n\\nprior to Chapter 212, the WPL contained some penalties for employers,\\n\\nincluding criminal and monetary penalties. See N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.10 (1991).\\n\\nChapter 212 divided N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.10 into three subsections. See N.J.S.A.\\n\\n34:11-4.10(a) to (c). Substantively, those subsections impose more serious\\n\\ncriminal sanctions, id. at -4.10(a), and provide remedies for employees in the\\n\\nform of liquidated damages and attorneys’ fees, id. at -4.10(c). Since August\\n\\n6, 2019, beyond just the “full amount of wages” improperly withheld, N.J.S.A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       13\\n 34:11-4.7, and criminal and monetary penalties, N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.10 (1991),\\n\\nthe WPL has allowed an employee to\\n\\n            recover in a civil action the full amount of any wages\\n            due, or any wages lost because of any retaliatory action\\n            taken in violation of [N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.10(a)] . . . plus\\n            an amount of liquidated damages equal to not more than\\n            200 percent of the wages lost or of the wages due,\\n            together with costs and reasonable [attorneys’] fees[.]\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.10(c) (emphases added).]\\n\\nChapter 212 also created a substantive defense to the liquidated damages\\n\\nprovision if the employer can satisfy certain elements. Ibid.\\n\\n                                       2.\\n\\n      The WHL was enacted in 1966 to “protect employees from unfair wages\\n\\nand excessive hours.” Hargrove, \\n220 N.J. at 304\\n (quoting In re Raymour &\\n\\nFlanigan Furniture, \\n405 N.J. Super. 367\\n, 376 (App. Div. 2009)). The WHL\\n\\ngoverns the minimum wage “in order to safeguard [the] . . . general well-\\n\\nbeing” of employees and employers, N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a, and for certain\\n\\nemployers, imposes an overtime rate for each hour of work in excess of the\\n\\nforty-hour work week, N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a4. Since the WHL was enacted,\\n\\nattorneys’ fees have been recoverable under the statute. L. 1966, c. 113 § 26.\\n\\nSimilar to the WPL, “[t]he remedial purpose of the [WHL] dictates that it\\n\\nshould be given a liberal construction.” Dep’t of Labor v. Pepsi-Cola Co., \\n170\\n\\nN.J. 59\\n, 62 (2001).\\n                                       14\\n       Originally, N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.1 (1967) provided that no claim for\\n\\ndamages under the WHL “shall be valid with respect to any such claim which\\n\\nhas arisen more than [two] years prior to the commencement of an action for\\n\\nthe recovery thereof.” (emphasis added). This two-year “look-back” period\\n\\noperated as a statute of limitations for private rights of action. 2 Chapter 212\\n\\namended the two-year statute of limitations (and other parts of N.J.S.A. 34:11-\\n\\n56a25.1) to provide that:\\n\\n            No claim for unpaid minimum wages, unpaid overtime\\n            compensation,      unlawful     discharge   or     other\\n            discriminatory acts taken in retaliation against the\\n            employee, or other damages under this act shall be valid\\n            with respect to any such claim which has arisen more\\n            than six years prior to the commencement of an action\\n            for the recovery thereof. In determining when an action\\n            is commenced, the action shall be considered to be\\n\\n\\n2\\n   Although the Appellate Division mentioned that this “look-back period . . .\\nfunction[s] as a statute of repose,” Maia, 475 N.J. Super. at 51, we note that\\nthis provision functions as a statute of limitations, see Iliadis v. Wal-Mart\\nStores, Inc., \\n191 N.J. 88\\n, 116 (2007) (classifying the WHL’s previous two-year\\n“look-back” provision as a statute of limitations). A statute of repose means\\nthat the “time within which suit may be brought . . . is entirely unrelated to the\\naccrual of any cause of action.” Rosenberg v. Town of North Bergen, \\n61 N.J.\\n190\\n, 199 (1972). In contrast, a statute of limitations fixes a “time within\\nwhich an injured person must institute an action seeking redress, and generally\\nthis time span is measured from the moment the cause of action accrues.”\\nIbid.\\n Although the WHL frames the time period by looking backward from the\\ntime of filing the complaint rather than looking forward from the accrual date\\nof the cause of action, the amended six-year “look-back” provision in N.J.S.A.\\n34:11-56a25.1 is firmly tied to the date on which the cause of action arose and\\nis therefore a statute of limitations, not a statute of repose.\\n\\n                                        15\\n             commenced on the date when a complaint is filed . . .\\n            in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25.1 (emphases added).]\\n\\n      In addition to extending the WHL’s statute of limitations from two to six\\n\\nyears, 3 Chapter 212 now allows a plaintiff to seek liquidated damages.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 34:11-56a25 (providing that an “employee may recover in a civil\\n\\naction . . . an additional amount equal to not more than 200 percent of the\\n\\namount of the unpaid minimum wages or wages lost due to retaliatory action\\n\\nas liquidated damages”).\\n\\n      Relevant to the WPL and WHL, Section 14 of Chapter 212 explicitly\\n\\nstates that “[t]his act shall take effect immediately, except that [S]ection 13\\n\\nshall take effect on the first day of the third month following enactment.” L.\\n\\n2019, c. 212 § 14 (emphasis added). Section 13 is not relevant to this appeal.\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Chapter 212 does not include any language about the limitations period for\\nclaims brought under the WPL. In the face of that silence, the Appellate\\nDivision concluded from a statement in the legislative history of Chapter 212\\nthat the six-year limitations period explicitly added to the WHL was intended\\nto apply to the WPL despite the amendments’ silence on that point. See Maia,\\n475 N.J. Super. at 53-54 (quoting the Sponsor’s Statement to S. 1790, which\\nindicates that “the bill . . . provides the same opportunity for workers\\naggrieved by violations of the wage payment law to bring a civil action as\\nworkers are provided for violations of the minimum wage law”). We disagree\\nwith that conclusion. See, e.g., State v. Ryan, \\n249 N.J. 581\\n, 599 (2022) (“It is\\nthe Legislature’s prerogative to impose a requirement in one context but not\\nanother; it is our duty to treat that distinction as meaningful.”). The explicit\\nestablishment of a six-year limitations period for the WHL has no bearing on\\nthe limitations period for the WPL.\\n                                           16\\n                                         C.\\n\\n      A comparison of the relevant pre- and post-Chapter 212 provisions of the\\n\\nWPL and WHL is telling. By adding liquidated damages and a retaliation\\n\\nclaim to both the WPL and WHL, attorneys’ fees to the WPL, and by extending\\n\\nthe statute of limitations in the WHL, Chapter 212 imposes new legal\\n\\nconsequences to events that occurred prior to its enactment. Chapter 212 now\\n\\nallows plaintiffs to bring new claims with enhanced damages that were not\\n\\npreviously available to plaintiffs at the time their injuries occurred, thereby\\n\\nchanging the “legal consequences of acts.” Riley, \\n219 N.J. at 285\\n. The\\n\\nchanges are not merely procedural; rather, they affect the duties and liabilities\\n\\ninvolved. Because Chapter 212 “attaches new legal consequences to events,”\\n\\napplying the provisions of Chapter 212 to conduct “completed before its\\n\\nenactment” would therefore be retroactive application. See Landgraf, \\n511 U.S.\\n\\nat 269-70\\n (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Moreover, we respectfully view the Appellate Division’s reliance on\\n\\nHildreth to conclude otherwise to be misplaced. In Hildreth, we determined\\n\\nwhether certain amendments to the Child Sexual Abuse Act (CSAA),\\n\\nCharitable Immunity Act (CIA), and Tort Claims Act (TCA), that went into\\n\\neffect on December 1, 2019, applied retroactively or prospectively to the\\n\\nplaintiff’s allegations of sexual assault against an elementary school teacher.\\n\\n                                        17\\n 252 N.J. at 510-11. The amendments in Hildreth extended the statute of\\n\\nlimitations for victims of child sexual abuse to file a claim under the CSAA\\n\\nand “removed the requirement that plaintiffs bringing CSAA complaints\\n\\nagainst public entities file a TCA notice of claim within ninety days of their\\n\\nclaim accruing.” Id. at 511. “The amendment [to the CSAA] was explicitly\\n\\nmade retroactive, applying to child sexual abuse that ‘occurred prior to, on or\\n\\nafter’” the effective date. Id. at 512 (quoting N.J.S.A. 2A:14-2a(a)(1)).\\n\\n      One month after the amendments went into effect, the plaintiff filed suit\\n\\nagainst the defendants, including the school district and elementary school,\\n\\neven though the plaintiff’s claim accrued in 2016. Id. at 510, 514. The\\n\\ndefendants “moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to file a notice of claim\\n\\nwithin ninety days of the claim’s accrual in 2016” as was required by the TCA\\n\\nprior to the 2019 amendments. Id. at 510-11, 515.\\n\\n      We affirmed the Appellate Division’s decision to uphold the denial of the\\n\\nmotion to dismiss and held that those “who file a CSAA complaint against a\\n\\npublic entity after December 1, 2019 -- even if their cause of action accrued\\n\\nmuch earlier -- need not file a TCA notice of claim before filing suit.” Id. at\\n\\n515, 519. In our reasoning, we highlighted that the TCA amendment set forth\\n\\nchanges to the TCA’s procedural requirements and that by applying the TCA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       18\\n amendment to the plaintiff’s claim, we were not applying the statute\\n\\nretroactively. Id. at 522.\\n\\n      Hildreth is distinguishable from this appeal because the amendments to\\n\\nprocedural requirements at issue there did not create new damages, change the\\n\\nrights, responsibilities, claims, and defenses that parties can assert, or\\n\\nimplicate new legal burdens, as is the case here with Chapter 212. See\\n\\nSutherland on Statutory Construction § 41:4 at 421 (7th ed. 2009) (“Whether a\\n\\nstatute is ‘substantive’ or ‘procedural’ is relevant to determin[ing] if it should\\n\\nbe applied retroactively.”); see also Landgraf, \\n511 U.S. at 275\\n (“Changes in\\n\\nprocedural rules may often be applied in suits arising before their enactment\\n\\nwithout raising concerns about retroactivity.”).\\n\\n      In sum, to apply the amendments contained in Chapter 212 at issue in\\n\\nthis appeal to claims based on conduct prior to Chapter 212’s August 6, 2019\\n\\neffective date would be to apply Chapter 212 retroactively. We therefore turn\\n\\nto the question of whether there is “clear evidence of [legislative] intent that\\n\\n[Chapter 212] should apply to cases arising before its enactment.” See\\n\\nLandgraf, \\n511 U.S. at 286\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        19\\n                                         V.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      New Jersey courts “have long followed a general rule of statutory\\n\\nconstruction that favors prospective application of statutes.” Gibbons v.\\n\\nGibbons, \\n86 N.J. 515\\n, 521 (1981) (emphasis added); see also Kopczynski v.\\n\\nCamden County, \\n2 N.J. 419\\n, 424 (1949) (“[W]ords in a statute ought not to\\n\\nhave a [retroactive] operation unless they are so clear, strong and imperative\\n\\nthat no other meaning can be annexed to them, or unless the intent of the\\n\\nLegislature cannot otherwise be satisfied.”). This is because it is “[a]\\n\\nfundamental principle of jurisprudence . . . that retroactive application of new\\n\\nlaws is usually unfair.” Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 41:2 at 386\\n\\n(7th ed. 2009). That rule, however, “is not to be applied mechanistically.”\\n\\nJohnson, 226 N.J. at 387 (quoting Gibbons, \\n86 N.J. at 522\\n).\\n\\n      We apply a two-part test to determine if a statute should apply\\n\\nretroactively. We must first determine “whether the Legislature intended to\\n\\ngive the statute retroactive application”; and second, “whether retroactive\\n\\napplication of that statute will result in either an unconstitutional interference\\n\\nwith vested rights or a manifest injustice.” James v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., 216\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        20\\nN.J. 552\\n, 563 (2014) (quoting In re D.C., \\n146 N.J. 31\\n, 50 (1996)). 4 “Both\\n\\nquestions must be satisfied for a statute to be applied retroactively.” Johnson,\\n\\n226 N.J. at 387.\\n\\n      As to the first question, there are three circumstances that justify\\n\\napplying a statute retroactively: (1) when the Legislature explicitly or\\n\\nimplicitly expresses an intent that a law be retroactive; (2) when an\\n\\namendment is ameliorative or curative; or (3) when the parties’ expectations\\n\\nwarrant retroactive application. Ibid.\\n\\n      First, regarding the Legislature’s expression of intent, courts generally\\n\\n“enforce newly enacted substantive statutes prospectively, unless [the\\n\\nLegislature] clearly expresses a contrary intent.” J.D-F., 248 N.J. at 22\\n\\n(alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Maeker v. Ross, \\n219 N.J.\\n\\n565\\n, 578 (2014)); NL Indus., Inc. v. State, \\n228 N.J. 280\\n, 295 (2017) (“In the\\n\\nsubset of legislative action modifying existing law, a new law is treated as\\n\\npresumptively prospective in application ‘unless there is an unequivocal\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n   In James, the Court addressed the two-part test for whether retroactive\\napplication is appropriate. It determined that the first part of that test was\\nunmet and therefore did not reach the second part of the test. See \\n216 N.J. at\\n563, 572-75\\n. We similarly do not reach any aspect of the second part of the\\ntest for retroactive application here because, like in James, we hold that the\\nfirst part of the test is unmet. Before applying the second part, we would need\\nto address an open question about the manifest injustice standard left\\nunresolved. See Oberhand v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, \\n193 N.J. 558\\n, 572 (2008).\\n                                         21\\n expression of contrary legislative intent.’” (quoting Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds\\n\\nTobacco Co., \\n121 N.J. 69\\n, 95 (1990))); see also State v. Bailey, \\n251 N.J. 101\\n,\\n\\n127 (2022) (“In the absence of evidence of legislative intent that the\\n\\namendment to N.J.R.E. 509 would retroactively abrogate a privilege, we view\\n\\nthat amendment to apply prospectively to marital communications that were\\n\\nmade on or after the effective date.”); State v. Lane, \\n251 N.J. 84\\n, 87 (2022)\\n\\n(holding that N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(14) should be applied prospectively since\\n\\nthere is no indication in the statutory language “that [it] applies to defendants\\n\\nsentenced prior to the provision’s effective date”). The Legislature may\\n\\nconvey its intent to apply a statute retroactively by expressing it explicitly “in\\n\\nthe language of the statute or in the pertinent legislative history,” or impliedly,\\n\\nby rendering it necessary “to make the statute workable or to give it the most\\n\\nsensible interpretation.” Gibbons, \\n86 N.J. at 522\\n.\\n\\n      Second, when determining whether a statute or amendment is\\n\\nameliorative or curative, courts look to whether the statute or amendment “is\\n\\ndesigned merely to carry out or explain the intent of the original statute.”\\n\\nJohnson, 226 N.J. at 388 (quoting Nelson v. Bd. of Educ., \\n148 N.J. 358\\n, 370\\n\\n(1997)). In other words, a statute or amendment is curative when “its purpose\\n\\nis ‘to remedy a perceived imperfection in or misapplication of a statute and not\\n\\nto alter the intended scope or purposes of the original act.’” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n                                        22\\n       And third, the expectation of the parties: if there is no “clear expression\\n\\nof legislative intent” concerning retroactivity, \\nibid.\\n (quoting Gibbons, \\n86 N.J.\\n\\nat 523\\n), then “a court will look at the controlling law at the relevant time and\\n\\nconsider the parties’ reasonable expectations as to the law,” which may\\n\\nwarrant retroactive application, id. at 389. “An expectation of retroactive\\n\\napplication ‘should be strongly apparent to the parties in order to override the\\n\\nlack of any explicit or implicit expression of intent for retroactive\\n\\napplication.’” Ibid. (quoting James, \\n216 N.J. at 573\\n).\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      We hold that Chapter 212 is to be applied prospectively to conduct that\\n\\noccurred on or after August 6, 2019 -- Chapter 212’s effective date -- not\\n\\nretroactively to conduct that occurred before the effective date.\\n\\n      There is nothing in the text or legislative history of Chapter 212 to\\n\\nexplicitly or implicitly suggest retroactive application. As we have stated on\\n\\nnumerous occasions in J.D-F., 248 N.J. at 22, Riley, \\n219 N.J. at 285\\n, NL\\n\\nIndus., 228 N.J. at 283, Bailey, 251 N.J. at 101, and Lane, 251 N.J. at 87-88,\\n\\nwhen the legislative intent does not explicitly or implicitly indicate retroactive\\n\\napplication of statutes, we are hesitant to do so. Here, moreover, the\\n\\nLegislature expressly stated in Section 14 of Chapter 212 that the new\\n\\nprovisions “shall take effect immediately.” L. 2019, c. 212 § 14. New Jersey\\n\\n                                        23\\n courts have repeatedly construed language stating that a provision is to be\\n\\n“effective immediately,” or “effective immediately on a given date,” to signal\\n\\nprospective application because it “bespeak[s] an intent contrary to, and not\\n\\nsupportive of, retroactive application.” Pisack v. B & C Towing, Inc., \\n240 N.J.\\n\\n360\\n, 371 (2020) (quoting Cruz v. Cent. Jersey Landscaping, Inc., \\n195 N.J. 33\\n,\\n\\n48 (2008)); Lane, 251 N.J. at 96.\\n\\n      Nor is Chapter 212 ameliorative or curative. It does not clarify existing\\n\\nlaw; rather, Chapter 212 adds substantive rights including new causes of\\n\\naction, defenses, and damages to the WPL and WHL, and extends the statute of\\n\\nlimitations for WHL claims.\\n\\n      And the record does not suggest that the parties had any clear or\\n\\nreasonable expectation that Chapter 212 would apply retroactively. See\\n\\nJohnson, 226 N.J. at 388-89; Lane, 251 N.J. at 95.\\n\\n      In sum, neither legislative expression, the nature of the amendments, nor\\n\\nthe parties’ expectations, warrants a departure from the presumptive\\n\\nprospectivity that applies to substantive legislation. Accordingly, we need not\\n\\nreach the second part of the retroactivity test. See James, \\n216 N.J. at 563\\n, 572-\\n\\n75.\\n\\n      Thus, for claims based on conduct that occurred prior to August 6, 2019\\n\\n-- Chapter 212’s effective date -- plaintiffs cannot rely on Chapter 212. Any\\n\\n                                       24\\n claims for new damages or remedies added by Chapter 212 can be brought\\n\\nonly as to conduct that took place on or after August 6, 2019. That means that\\n\\nsome of Maia’s claims cannot be brought. 5 Because Howarth joined IEW in\\n\\nApril 2020 and his claims arose solely from conduct that occurred after August\\n\\n6, 2019, he may proceed with all of his claims.\\n\\n                                       VI.\\n\\n      We therefore reverse the Appellate Division’s interlocutory judgment,\\n\\nreinstate the order partially dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint, and remand for\\n\\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER APTER, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE FASCIALE’s\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  As to Maia’s non-Chapter 212-based claims for recovery under the WPL for\\nwages alleged to have been improperly withheld prior to August 6, 2019, the\\nAppellate Division stated that “[n]either party has brought to our attention any\\nprecedent regarding the accrual date of a WPL claim” and that the court’s\\n“independent research reveals none.” Maia, 475 N.J.

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n             In the Matter of Registrant R.H. (A-20/21-23) (088232)\\n\\nArgued May 1, 2024 -- Decided July 1, 2024\\n\\nRABNER, C.J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       Megan’s Law requires individuals who commit certain sex offenses to register\\nwith a law enforcement agency. If they meet certain requirements, they can apply to\\nterminate their obligation to register. One requirement is “that the person has not\\ncommitted an offense within 15 years following conviction or release from a\\ncorrectional facility for any term of imprisonment imposed.” N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f)\\n(emphasis added). Another is that the person is “not likely to pose a threat to the\\nsafety of others.” Ibid. Here, the Court considers whether the requirement to\\nremain offense-free applies to juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent.\\n\\n       R.H. was adjudicated delinquent of aggravated sexual assault in 2009 and has\\nlived offense-free since. The trial court denied R.H.’s motion to terminate his\\nMegan’s Law obligations based on the fifteen-year waiting period in subsection (f),\\nwhich had not yet ended.\\n\\n       T.L. was adjudicated delinquent of aggravated sexual assault in 2005 and was\\nconvicted in 2015 of a petty disorderly persons offense for using offensive language.\\nHe filed a motion to terminate his Megan’s Law obligations in May 2022. The trial\\ncourt denied T.L.’s request based on his 2015 conviction.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division affirmed both trial court judgments in a consolidated\\nopinion. In re Registrant R.H., 475 N.J. Super. 460, 462 (App. Div. 2023). The\\nCourt granted certification. 256 N.J. 352 (2024); 256 N.J. 331 (2024).\\n\\nHELD: Based on the plain language the Legislature used in crafting N.J.S.A. 2C:7-\\n2(f), the requirement to remain offense-free for fifteen years applies to juveniles\\nwho are prosecuted as adults and convicted of a listed sex offense, or released from\\na correctional facility, but not to those who are adjudicated delinquent in the family\\ncourt. Consistent with the law’s text, however, all registrants including juveniles\\nmust satisfy the second requirement -- the public safety requirement -- to be eligible\\nto terminate their obligations under Megan’s Law. Here, the offense-free prong does\\nnot apply to R.H. and T.L. because they were adjudicated delinquent, and not\\n                                          1\\n convicted, of a sex offense. The Court therefore remands each matter to the\\nappropriate trial court to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence\\nthat R.H. and T.L. satisfy the public safety prong.\\n\\n1. Cases in which juveniles are accused of misconduct can proceed in different\\nways. For more serious matters, juveniles can be waived to the Criminal Part, where\\ntheir cases proceed as though they were adults and they can be “convicted” if found\\nguilty. N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(f)(1). Less serious allegations are resolved in the\\nFamily Part, where a juvenile found culpable is “adjudicated delinquent.” N.J.S.A.\\n2A:4A-41. As a result, adults and some juveniles are “convicted,” while other\\njuveniles are “adjudicated delinquent.” The two concepts are distinct. (pp. 13-14)\\n\\n2. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f) has several components. As a threshold matter, it applies to\\nindividuals who are “required to register” but are not subject to lifetime registration\\nunder subsection (g). Subsection (g) does not apply to juveniles. The remaining\\ntwo prongs are (1) whether a person has been offense-free for fifteen years, and (2)\\nwhether the individual does not likely pose a threat to public safety. The public\\nsafety prong is straightforward. It has no limiting or qualifying language and plainly\\napplies to everyone required to register -- adults and juveniles alike. The first prong\\ncontains additional, qualifying language, namely, that the registrant has remained\\noffense-free “following conviction or release from a correctional facility.” N.J.S.A.\\n2C:7-2(f). That language encompasses adults as well as some juveniles, but it does\\nnot expressly extend to individuals who have been “adjudicated delinquent” or\\n“acquitted by reason of insanity.” Those terms appear at various places throughout\\nMegan’s Law but not in subsection (f). To apply the offense-free prong of\\nsubsection (f) to all juveniles -- that is, to those adjudicated delinquent of a sex\\noffense as well as those convicted of one -- would require that the Court imply or\\nadd language the Legislature included elsewhere in Megan’s Law but left out of\\nsubsection (f), which the Court cannot do. Based on the statute’s plain language, the\\noffense-free prong of subsection (f) does not apply to juveniles adjudicated\\ndelinquent. The Court explains why dicta from In re Registrant J.G., 169 N.J. 304\\n(2001), and State in Interest of C.K., 233 N.J. 44 (2018), do not affect that\\nconclusion. (pp. 15-22)\\n\\n3. Under today’s ruling, juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent may apply to\\nterminate their obligations under Megan’s Law before reaching age eighteen. If they\\ndo, they must still demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that they are “not\\nlikely to pose a threat to the safety of others” to obtain relief. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f);\\nC.K., 233 N.J. at 77. Judges commonly look to whether an individual has made\\nprogress over a period of time both during confinement and afterward in the\\ncommunity. Although the offense-free prong of subsection (f) does not apply to\\njuveniles adjudicated delinquent, proof of the commission of a later offense would\\nbe relevant to assess whether a person poses a public safety risk. (pp. 22-23)\\n                                          2\\n 4. For juveniles who are convicted of an offense, the fifteen-year look-back period\\nstarts from the time of conviction for the predicate sex offense or release from a\\ncorrectional facility, whichever is later. See In re Registrant H.D., 241 N.J. 412, 421\\n(2020). The period does not reset after the commission of a later offense. (p. 24)\\n\\n5. Both R.H. and T.L. were adjudicated delinquent of aggravated sexual assault.\\nBecause they were not convicted of an offense, subsection (f)’s first prong -- the\\nrequirement to remain offense-free for fifteen years -- does not apply to them. To be\\neligible to terminate their Megan’s Law obligations, R.H. and T.L. must each satisfy\\nthe second prong and demonstrate they are “not likely to pose a threat to the safety\\nof others.” N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f).

If they meet certain requirements,\\n\\nthey can apply to terminate their obligation to register. One requirement is\\n\\n“that the person has not committed an offense within 15 years following\\n\\nconviction or release from a correctional facility for any term of imprisonment\\n\\nimposed.” N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f) (emphasis added). Another is that the person is\\n\\n“not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                         2\\n       This consolidated appeal raises a novel question: whether the\\n\\nrequirement to remain offense-free applies to juveniles who are adjudicated\\n\\ndelinquent. Based on the plain language the Legislature used in crafting the\\n\\nstatute, we find that the requirement applies to juveniles who are prosecuted as\\n\\nadults and convicted of a listed sex offense, or released from a correctional\\n\\nfacility, but not to those who are adjudicated delinquent in proceedings in the\\n\\nfamily court.\\n\\n      Consistent with the law’s text, however, all registrants including\\n\\njuveniles must satisfy the second requirement -- the public safety requirement\\n\\n-- to be eligible for termination of their obligations under Megan’s Law.\\n\\n      Because the Appellate Division reached a different conclusion regarding\\n\\nthe first requirement, we reverse its judgment and remand both cases involved\\n\\nin this appeal to the trial court for further proceedings.\\n\\n                                         I.\\n\\n      To provide relevant background information, we begin with a brief\\n\\noverview of Megan’s Law.\\n\\n      The Legislature enacted Megan’s Law, N.J.S.A. 2C:7-1 to -23, in 1994\\n\\nto combat “[t]he danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders.” N.J.S.A. 2C:7-\\n\\n1(a). The law imposes a scheme to register sex offenders and notify the public\\n\\nabout offenders who present a danger to children. Ibid.\\n\\n                                         3\\n       Megan’s Law requires “[a] person who has been convicted, adjudicated\\n\\ndelinquent or found not guilty by reason of insanity” of certain sex offenses to\\n\\nregister with law enforcement. Id. at -2(a)(1). Section 2(b) of the statute\\n\\ndefines the term “sex offense” and lists various offenses that can trigger\\n\\nMegan’s Law obligations. Id. at -2(b).\\n\\n      Offenders are required to register with the police department where they\\n\\nlive. Id. at -2(c). They must provide personal information -- their name, social\\n\\nsecurity number, physical description, date of birth, address, place of\\n\\nemployment, school enrollment status, and other details -- as well as\\n\\nfingerprint specimens and a brief description of the offense. Id. at -4(b)(1) to\\n\\n(2). Registrants are required to notify law enforcement if they change their\\n\\naddress, employment, or school enrollment status. Id. at -2(d)(1). Failure to\\n\\nregister or inform law enforcement of a change of address or status is a third-\\n\\ndegree crime. Id. at -2(a)(3), -2(d)(1).\\n\\n      Megan’s Law also provides for public notification that is keyed to the\\n\\nlevel of risk a registrant poses. Id. at -8. There are three levels or tiers. For\\n\\nTier One, the low level of risk of re-offense, notification is limited to “law\\n\\nenforcement agencies likely to encounter the person registered.” Id.\\n\\nat -8(c)(1). For Tier Two, the moderate level of risk, notification is also made\\n\\nto “organizations in the community including schools, religious and youth\\n\\n                                           4\\n organizations.” Id. at -8(c)(2). For Tier Three, the high level of risk,\\n\\nnotification must also “reach members of the public likely to encounter the\\n\\nperson registered,” in accordance with the Attorney General’s Guidelines. Id.\\n\\nat -8(c)(3); see also Attorney General Guidelines for Law Enforcement for the\\n\\nImplementation of Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification\\n\\nLaws 17-18, 42-46 (rev. Feb. 2007), https://www.nj.gov/oag/dcj/megan/\\n\\nmeganguidelines-2-07.pdf (adopted pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:7-8(a)).\\n\\n      Offenders are classified based on a series of risk factors and the use of a\\n\\nRegistrant Risk Assessment Scale (Scale). See N.J.S.A. 2C:7-(8)(b); Attorney\\n\\nGeneral Guidelines 27, Ex. E, F. Mental health experts and law enforcement\\n\\nofficials developed the Scale, and tier classifications based on it are entitled to\\n\\ndeference. In re Registrant C.A., 146 N.J. 71, 82, 108 (1996).\\n\\n“[C]lassifications based on the Scale are subject to judicial review and\\n\\nmodification on a case-by-case basis.” Id. at 108-09.\\n\\n      Information about certain sex offenders is included in a central registry\\n\\nthat is made available to the public on the internet. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-12, -13.\\n\\n      Sections 2(f) and 2(g) together govern motions to terminate a person’s\\n\\nobligations under Megan’s Law. Pursuant to subsection (g), individuals who\\n\\nare convicted, adjudicated delinquent, or acquitted by reason of insanity for\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         5\\n certain sex offenses, or for more than one sex offense, are required to register\\n\\nfor life. Id. at -2(g). 1\\n\\n       A person required to register who is not subject to subsection (g) may\\n\\napply to the trial court “to terminate the obligation upon proof that the person\\n\\nhas not committed an offense within 15 years following conviction or release\\n\\nfrom a correctional facility for any term of imprisonment imposed, whichever\\n\\nis later, and is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.” Id. at -2(f).\\n\\n                                          II.\\n\\n                                          A.\\n\\n       At age fifteen, R.H. sexually assaulted his younger stepbrother. R.H.\\n\\nadmitted his misconduct when the police interviewed him in the presence of\\n\\nhis father. On October 14, 2009, R.H. was adjudicated delinquent of one count\\n\\nof aggravated sexual assault. The trial court sentenced him to three years’\\n\\nprobation -- eighteen months at a residential treatment facility followed by\\n\\neighteen months of aftercare treatment. He was successfully discharged in\\n\\n2012 and has lived offense-free since 2009.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  As discussed later, the Court in State in Interest of C.K. held that subsection\\n(g)’s lifetime registration and notification requirements are unconstitutional as\\napplied to juveniles. 233 N.J. 44, 48 (2018).\\n                                          6\\n       Since 2009, R.H. has been evaluated five times for the risk of re-offense.\\n\\nIn 2011, he was designated at Tier Two. In his most recent evaluation in\\n\\nOctober 2020, a psychologist concluded that R.H. “is not likely to commit a\\n\\nsexual offense in the future.” The following month, the trial court designated\\n\\nR.H. as a Tier Two level of risk for re-offense but limited community\\n\\nnotification to the Tier One level.\\n\\n      R.H. later filed a motion to terminate his obligations under Megan’s\\n\\nLaw. The trial court found that the fifteen-year waiting period in subsection\\n\\n(f) applied to juveniles who were adjudicated delinquent for an offense they\\n\\ncommitted when they were older than fourteen. The court explained it was\\n\\nbound by this Court’s ruling in In re Registrant J.G., 169 N.J. 304 (2001), and\\n\\ntherefore denied R.H.’s application. 2 Because the trial court bifurcated the\\n\\nmotion and considered the statutory question first, it did not address whether\\n\\nR.H. posed a threat to others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n   The Court in J.G. held that for “juveniles adjudicated delinquent for sexual\\noffenses committed when they were under age fourteen, Megan’s Law\\nregistration and community notification orders shall terminate at age eighteen\\nif the” trial court finds the individual “is not likely to pose a threat to the\\nsafety of others.” 169 N.J. at 337.\\n                                          7\\n                                        B.\\n\\n       On July 11, 2005, T.L. was adjudicated delinquent of one count of\\n\\naggravated sexual assault for engaging in sexual acts with his younger sisters\\n\\nand a cousin as part of a game of “truth or dare.” T.L. was fifteen or sixteen at\\n\\nthe time. After the abuse was reported to the police, T.L. revealed that he had\\n\\nbeen sexually abused when he was a child.\\n\\n       The trial court placed T.L. on probation for three years and ordered him\\n\\nto attend therapy, which he successfully completed. In November 2008, the\\n\\ncourt designated T.L. at Tier Two but ordered notification obligations at Tier\\n\\nOne.\\n\\n       In 2015, T.L. was convicted of a petty disorderly persons offense under\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:33-2(b) for using offensive language. He was ordered to pay $508\\n\\nin fines and fees. T.L. has remained offense-free since.\\n\\n       A psychologist evaluated T.L. in March 2022. She found that he\\n\\n“present[ed] a low risk of engaging in future acts of sexually inappropriate\\n\\nbehaviors” and was “not likely to pose a threat to others in the community.”\\n\\n       T.L. filed a motion to terminate his Megan’s Law obligations in May\\n\\n2022. Among other things, he argued that the offense-free prong of subsection\\n\\n(f) does not apply to individuals adjudicated delinquent of a qualifying sex\\n\\noffense. The trial court rejected the argument and denied T.L.’s request. The\\n\\n                                        8\\n court explained it was bound by this Court’s rulings in State in Interest of\\n\\nC.K., 233 N.J. 44 (2018), and J.G. The court acknowledged but did not make\\n\\na finding on the psychologist’s conclusion that T.L. did not likely pose a threat\\n\\nto others.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      R.H. and T.L. both appealed, and the Appellate Division heard oral\\n\\nargument for the cases back-to-back. It later affirmed both trial court\\n\\njudgments in a consolidated opinion. In re Registrant R.H., 475 N.J. Super.\\n\\n460, 462 (App. Div. 2023).\\n\\n      The appellate court concluded that the fifteen-year offense-free\\n\\nrequirement in subsection (f) applies to juveniles adjudicated delinquent. Id.\\n\\nat 467, 470. The court explained it was “bound by the dictum” in C.K. and\\n\\nJ.G. Id. at 467. It was also “satisfied that the plain and ordinary meaning of\\n\\nthe” language in subsection (f) supported its conclusion. Id. at 470. The\\n\\nAppellate Division reasoned that the Megan’s Law scheme “is predicated on”\\n\\nwho must register “under subsections (a) and (b), which includes individuals\\n\\nwho were adjudicated delinquent.” Ibid.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division rejected the constitutional arguments R.H. and\\n\\nT.L. raised. Id. at 471. In doing so, the court stated that “juveniles, fifteen\\n\\nyears after another offense, may apply for release from Megan’s Law\\n\\n                                         9\\n requirements if they demonstrate they are unlikely to pose a threat to the safety\\n\\nof others.” Ibid.\\n\\n      We granted R.H.’s and T.L.’s petitions for certification. 256 N.J. 352\\n\\n(2024); 256 N.J. 331 (2024). We also granted leave to the Attorney General,\\n\\nthe Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL), and the\\n\\nRutgers Criminal and Youth Justice Clinic and American Civil Liberties Union\\n\\nof New Jersey, appearing jointly, to participate as friends of the court.\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n      R.H. and T.L. submitted a joint brief. They contend the Appellate\\n\\nDivision mistakenly found that the fifteen-year offense-free requirement in\\n\\nsubsection (f) applies to individuals who have been adjudicated delinquent and\\n\\nseek to terminate their obligations under Megan’s Law. They argue that the\\n\\nAppellate Division conflated “conviction” with “adjudication of delinquency”\\n\\nin subsection (f) and relied on non-binding dicta from other cases.\\n\\n      The ACDL echoes those arguments. It emphasizes that the relevant plain\\n\\nlanguage of subsection (f) extends to people who are convicted, not to those\\n\\nadjudicated delinquent.\\n\\n      The State, represented by the Gloucester and Camden County\\n\\nProsecutors, urges the Court to affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division.\\n\\nThe State relies on the plain language of subsection (f) and “controlling\\n\\n                                        10\\n precedent” in J.G. and C.K. The Attorney General similarly maintains that the\\n\\nstatute’s text and structure, its legislative intent, and the Court’s precedents all\\n\\ndirect that individuals who are required to register under Megan’s Law,\\n\\nincluding juveniles like R.H. and T.L., must demonstrate that they remained\\n\\noffense-free for fifteen years and are not likely to pose a threat to others to be\\n\\neligible to terminate their registration requirements.\\n\\n      The parties and amici disagree as to whether the Appellate Division’s\\n\\nreading of subsection (f) would render it unconstitutional. For that reason,\\n\\nthey advance different positions on whether the doctrine of constitutional\\n\\navoidance should apply here.\\n\\n                                        IV.\\n\\n      We begin with R.H. and T.L.’s statutory argument about the scope of\\n\\nsubsection (f).\\n\\n      When we interpret the meaning of a statute, our review is de novo.\\n\\nDeSimone v. Springpoint Senior Living, Inc., 256 N.J. 172, 181 (2024). Our\\n\\ngoal “is to determine and give meaning to the Legislature’s intent.” State v.\\n\\nThompson, 250 N.J. 556, 572 (2022) (quoting State v. Carter, 247 N.J. 488,\\n\\n513 (2021)). To do so, we start with the plain language of the statute, which is\\n\\ntypically the “‘best indicator’ of legislative intent.” W.S. v. Hildreth, 252 N.J.\\n\\n506, 518 (2023) (quoting State v. Lane, 251 N.J. 84, 94 (2022)). We give\\n\\n                                         11\\n words their ordinary meaning and read them “in the context of ‘related\\n\\nprovisions . . . to give sense to the legislation as a whole.’” DeSimone, 256\\n\\nN.J. at 181 (quoting Perez v. Professionally Green, LLC, 215 N.J. 388, 399\\n\\n(2013)).\\n\\n      When “the plain language of a statute is clear, our task is complete.”\\n\\nSavage v. Township of Neptune, 257 N.J. 204, 215 (2024). When language is\\n\\nambiguous, we may consider extrinsic evidence, including legislative history.\\n\\nDiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492-93 (2005).\\n\\n      If “the Legislature has carefully employed a term in one place yet\\n\\nexcluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.” State v.\\n\\nCooper, 256 N.J. 593, 605 (2024) (quotation omitted). In other words, courts\\n\\nshould not add language to section (x) that the Legislature chose to include in\\n\\nsection (y) but left out of (x). The reason is simple: “The Legislature knows\\n\\nhow to write [a] . . . statute.” Murray v. Plainfield Rescue Squad, 210 N.J.\\n\\n581, 593 (2012).\\n\\n                                       V.\\n\\n      R.H. and T.L. contend that subsection (f)’s requirement that individuals\\n\\nremain offense-free for fifteen years does not apply to juveniles adjudicated\\n\\ndelinquent of a predicate offense. The Court has not considered the novel\\n\\nargument before. The parties understandably reason from dicta in prior\\n\\n                                       12\\n decisions, see State v. Rose, 206 N.J. 141, 183 (2011), but the language the\\n\\nparties focus on did not directly address the issue before the Court today.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Cases in which juveniles are accused of misconduct can proceed in\\n\\ndifferent ways. For more serious matters, prosecutors can file a motion to\\n\\n“seek[] waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case” from the\\n\\n“Family Part to an appropriate court.” N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(a).\\n\\n      The waiver statute applies to juveniles age fifteen and older at the time\\n\\nof the alleged conduct. Id. at (c)(1). The State must demonstrate “[t]here is\\n\\nprobable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a delinquent act which if\\n\\ncommitted by an adult would constitute” one of a number of enumerated\\n\\noffenses, including criminal homicide, carjacking, aggravated sexual assault,\\n\\nsexual assault, or kidnapping, among other listed crimes. Id. at (c)(2).\\n\\n      The statute lists various factors prosecutors must consider when deciding\\n\\nwhether to seek a waiver. Id. at (b), (c)(3). If a court is clearly convinced the\\n\\nprosecution abused its discretion in considering those factors, the court can\\n\\ndeny the motion to waive jurisdiction. Id. at (c)(3). If the motion is granted,\\n\\njuveniles can be waived to the Criminal Part, where their cases proceed as\\n\\nthough they were adults. Id. at (f)(1). If a jury later finds an individual\\n\\nculpable, the juvenile is “convicted” of the offense. Ibid.\\n\\n                                        13\\n       In general, less serious allegations are resolved in the Family Part. If a\\n\\njudge in that setting finds a juvenile is culpable, the individual is “adjudicated\\n\\ndelinquent.” N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-41.\\n\\n      As a result, in our system, adults and some juveniles are “convicted,”\\n\\nwhile other juveniles are “adjudicated delinquent.” The two concepts are\\n\\ndistinct in law and practice. See, e.g., In re Expungement Application of\\n\\nD.J.B., 216 N.J. 436, 446-48 (2014) (distinguishing between juvenile\\n\\nadjudications and convictions in the context of expungement); State v.\\n\\nCummings, 321 N.J. Super. 154, 170 (App. Div. 1999) (“[A] juvenile\\n\\nadjudication does not constitute conviction of a crime and may not be used for\\n\\nimpeachment purposes.”). The distinction has meaning when it comes to\\n\\nMegan’s Law as well. 3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Our focus throughout this opinion is on the term “conviction” in the first\\nprong of subsection (f), not the phrase that follows it, “or release from a\\ncorrectional facility for any term of imprisonment imposed.” Because the facts\\ndo not require us to consider the issue and the parties have not addressed it, we\\ndo not discuss the difference between juvenile and correctional facilities or\\nwhether a juvenile adjudicated delinquent can ever be imprisoned in a\\n“correctional facility for any term of imprisonment imposed.” N.J.S.A. 2C:7-\\n2(f). Any reference to a juvenile adjudicated delinquent in this opinion\\npresumes that the individual has not been released from a correctional facility\\nfor a term of imprisonment imposed.\\n                                        14\\n                                           B.\\n\\n      Against that backdrop, we turn to the meaning of subsection (f) of\\n\\nMegan’s Law, which allows for termination of the statute’s requirements if\\n\\ncertain conditions are met. We quote subsection (f) in full:\\n\\n             Except as provided in subsection g. of this section, a\\n             person required to register under this act may make\\n             application to the Superior Court of this State to\\n             terminate the obligation upon proof that the person has\\n             not committed an offense within 15 years following\\n             conviction or release from a correctional facility for any\\n             term of imprisonment imposed, whichever is later, and\\n             is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.\\n\\n             [N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f).]\\n\\n      Subsection (f) has several components. As a threshold matter, it applies\\n\\nto individuals who are “required to register” but are not subject to lifetime\\n\\nregistration under subsection (g). As noted earlier, subsection (g) does not\\n\\napply to juveniles. See C.K., 233 N.J. at 48 (finding subsection (g)\\n\\nunconstitutional as applied to juveniles).\\n\\n      Our primary focus is on the remaining two prongs: (1) whether a person\\n\\nhas been offense-free for fifteen years, and (2) whether the individual does not\\n\\nlikely pose a threat to public safety.\\n\\n      The latter prong, the public safety prong, is straightforward. It has no\\n\\nlimiting or qualifying language and plainly applies to everyone required to\\n\\nregister -- adults and juveniles alike.\\n                                          15\\n       The first prong contains additional, qualifying language, namely, that the\\n\\nregistrant has remained offense-free “following conviction or release from a\\n\\ncorrectional facility.” N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f). As discussed above, that language\\n\\nencompasses adults as well as some juveniles. They must demonstrate that\\n\\nthey have remained offense-free for fifteen years since their “conviction or\\n\\nrelease from a correctional facility.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Subsection (f)’s requirement that a person remain offense-free, however,\\n\\ndoes not expressly extend to individuals who have been “adjudicated\\n\\ndelinquent” or “acquitted by reason of insanity.” Those terms appear at\\n\\nvarious places throughout Megan’s Law but not in subsection (f). See, e.g., id.\\n\\nat -2(a)(1) (identifying individuals who must register); -2(b)(2) (listing\\n\\noffenses that require registration); -2(b)(3) (directing that similar sex offenses\\n\\nrequire registration); -2(g) (requiring lifetime registration in certain instances).\\n\\n      More specifically, and as noted earlier, the opening paragraph of\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:7-2 directs that an individual “who has been convicted,\\n\\nadjudicated delinquent or found not guilty by reason of insanity” of a listed\\n\\noffense must register in accordance with Megan’s Law. Id. at -2(a)(1)\\n\\n(emphasis added).\\n\\n      Subsection (g) likewise states that “[a] person required to register under\\n\\nthis section who has been convicted . . . , adjudicated delinquent, or acquitted\\n\\n                                        16\\n by reason of insanity” of certain sex offenses, or of more than one sex offense,\\n\\nis not eligible under subsection (f) to terminate their Megan’s Law obligations.\\n\\nSubsections (f) and (g) work in tandem. Subsection (f) cross-references (g)\\n\\nbut leaves out any reference to individuals who are adjudicated delinquent or\\n\\nfound not guilty by reason of insanity.\\n\\n      In yet another section, the Legislature provided that adjudications of\\n\\ndelinquency for certain offenses shall not be considered as sex offenses under\\n\\nthe act. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(b)(4)(a) to (c). In other words, convictions for those\\n\\noffenses are considered, but not juvenile adjudications.\\n\\n      The Legislature also drafted various exceptions to the requirement that\\n\\ninformation be made available on the internet. Megan’s Law exempts\\n\\nindividuals adjudicated delinquent of a sex offense, id. at -13(d)(1), but has\\n\\nmore limited exceptions for those convicted or acquitted by reason of insanity,\\n\\nid. at -13(d)(2) to (3).\\n\\n      Those examples demonstrate that the Legislature made policy choices in\\n\\nthe way it crafted Megan’s Law. It decided when to extend the law to\\n\\njuveniles adjudicated delinquent and when not to.\\n\\n      The Legislature made that very type of choice in the way it drafted\\n\\nsubsection (f). The plain language the Legislature used in the first prong\\n\\napplies to adults and to only those juveniles convicted of a sex offense -- not to\\n\\n                                          17\\n juveniles adjudicated delinquent or individuals found not guilty by reason of\\n\\ninsanity.\\n\\n      To apply the offense-free prong of subsection (f) to all juveniles -- that\\n\\nis, to those adjudicated delinquent of a sex offense as well as those convicted\\n\\nof one -- would require that we imply or add language the Legislature included\\n\\nelsewhere in Megan’s Law but left out of subsection (f). We cannot do so. See\\n\\nCooper, 256 N.J. at 605; Murray, 210 N.J. at 593. We rely instead on the plain\\n\\nwords of a statute to interpret its meaning. See Savage, 257 N.J. at 215-17.\\n\\n      Because the text of the statute is clear, we need not search for legislative\\n\\nhistory on this point. DiProspero, 183 N.J. at 492. In any event, the parties\\n\\nagree there is no relevant history that explains why the Legislature crafted part\\n\\nof subsection (f) to reach only individuals who have been convicted of a sex\\n\\noffense. We note, however, that other states treat juvenile offenders differently\\n\\nthan adults. See People in Int. of T.B., 489 P.3d 752, 769-70 (Colo. 2021)\\n\\n(surveying states and noting more lenient treatment of juvenile sex offenders);\\n\\nJ.G., 169 N.J. at 327-30 (same).\\n\\n      Based on the statute’s plain language, we hold that the first prong of\\n\\nsubsection (f), which requires proof that an individual has been offense-free\\n\\nfor fifteen years, applies only to adults and to those juveniles who have been\\n\\nconvicted or released from a correctional facility for a term of imprisonment\\n\\n                                       18\\n imposed. The first prong of subsection (f) does not apply to juveniles\\n\\nadjudicated delinquent. 4\\n\\n                                       C.\\n\\n      The rulings by the trial courts and the Appellate Division relied on dicta\\n\\nin J.G. and C.K.\\n\\n      J.G. involved a ten-year-old who committed a sex offense; his eight-\\n\\nyear-old cousin was the victim. 169 N.J. at 309. As part of a negotiated plea\\n\\nagreement, J.G. was adjudicated delinquent of conduct that would constitute\\n\\nsecond-degree sexual assault if committed by an adult. Id. at 310-12.\\n\\n      The Court attempted to harmonize the tension between the protective,\\n\\nrehabilitative philosophy of the Code of Juvenile Justice and the possibility of\\n\\nlifetime registration under Megan’s Law for juvenile sex offenders. Id. at 320,\\n\\n324-25. The Court observed, among other things, that the Code “limit[s] the\\n\\nduration of restrictions and punishments . . . imposed as a result of\\n\\ndelinquency adjudications.” Id. at 324-25 (discussing N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-47(a),\\n\\nwhich provides that orders of disposition terminate when a juvenile “attains\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  We recognize that the plain language of the offense-free prong of subsection\\n(f) likewise does not extend to individuals acquitted by reason of insanity. If a\\ncourt determines that a person cannot be released without posing a danger to\\noneself or to the community, the individual is committed to a mental health\\nfacility, subject to periodic review. N.J.S.A. 2C:4-8; State v. Krol, 68 N.J. 236,\\n263 (1975).\\n                                        19\\n the age of 18, or three years from the date of the order whichever is later\\n\\nunless such order involves incarceration or is sooner terminated”).\\n\\nSubsections (g) and (f) of Megan’s Law, by contrast, allow for lifetime\\n\\nregistration. See id. at 319.\\n\\n       The Court noted that the Code distinguished “between juveniles over and\\n\\nunder the age of fourteen.” Id. at 325-27. At the time, juveniles age fourteen\\n\\nand older could be waived and tried as adults. N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26(a)(1)\\n\\n(repealed by L. 2015, c. 89, § 6). 5\\n\\n       To reconcile Megan’s Law and the Code of Juvenile Justice, the Court\\n\\nheld\\n\\n             that with respect to juveniles adjudicated delinquent for\\n             sexual offenses committed when they were under age\\n             fourteen[,] Megan’s Law registration and community\\n             notification orders shall terminate at age eighteen if the\\n             Law Division, after a hearing held on motion of the\\n             adjudicated delinquent, determines on the basis of clear\\n             and convincing evidence that the delinquent is not\\n             likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.\\n\\n             [J.G., 169 N.J. at 337.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  In 2015, the Legislature increased the minimum age for waiver to fifteen.\\nN.J.S.A. 2A:4A-26.1(c)(1). Fourteen-year-olds can no longer be prosecuted as\\nadults.\\n                                       20\\n The Court explained its holding was “faithful to the rehabilitative goals of the\\n\\nJuvenile Code without undermining the salutary objectives of Megan’s Law.”\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n        Neither the parties nor the Court in J.G. focused on whether the fifteen-\\n\\nyear offense-free language in subsection (f) applied to juveniles who had been\\n\\nadjudicated delinquent.\\n\\n        The Court addressed a different issue in C.K.: whether subsection (g)\\n\\nwas unconstitutional as applied to juveniles. 233 N.J. at 48. The Court in\\n\\nC.K. thoroughly canvassed the history of Megan’s Law and its jurisprudence,\\n\\nthe Juvenile Code, rulings by the United States Supreme Court and this Court\\n\\nthat recognize juveniles are different from adults, as well as relevant rulings\\n\\nfrom other State Supreme Courts. Id. at 60-72. The Court “conclude[d] that\\n\\nsubsection (g)’s lifetime registration and notification requirements as applied\\n\\nto juveniles” bore “no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental\\n\\nobjective” and “violate[d] the substantive due process guarantee of Article I,\\n\\nParagraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution.” Id. at 48.\\n\\n        The decision in C.K. is based entirely on the constitutionality of\\n\\nsubsection (g). In dicta, the Court referenced subsection (f) as well. See, e.g.,\\n\\nid. at 75 (“Subsection (f) imposes presumptive lifetime registration and\\n\\nnotification requirements for sex offenses covered by subsection (g) but allows\\n\\n                                         21\\n for a juvenile sex offender to be relieved of those requirements fifteen years\\n\\nafter his juvenile adjudication or release from a correctional facility, provided\\n\\nhe has been offense-free and ‘is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of\\n\\nothers.’”); see also similar language at 47-48; 48-49; 77.\\n\\n      Once again, however, the Court in C.K. did not evaluate a question that\\n\\nwas not before it: whether the fifteen-year offense-free clause in subsection (f)\\n\\napplied to juveniles who have been adjudicated delinquent. The dicta in J.G.\\n\\nand C.K. is not controlling here. See In re Protest of Contract for Retail\\n\\nPharmacy Design, ___ N.J. ___ n.3 (2024) (slip op. at 27 n.3).\\n\\n      We add one more point about J.G. The decision held that registration\\n\\nand notification requirements terminate at age eighteen for juveniles\\n\\nadjudicated delinquent of sexual offenses committed when they were under\\n\\nage fourteen, provided they can satisfy the public safety prong in subsection\\n\\n(f). J.G., 169 N.J. at 337.\\n\\n      Under today’s ruling, juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent are not\\n\\nsubject to subsection (f)’s requirement that they must be offense-free for\\n\\nfifteen years. They may apply to terminate their obligations under Megan’s\\n\\nLaw before reaching age eighteen. If they do, they must still demonstrate, by\\n\\nclear and convincing evidence, that they are “not likely to pose a threat to the\\n\\nsafety of others” to obtain relief. N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f); C.K., 233 N.J. at 77.\\n\\n                                        22\\n       The State and the Attorney General contend that, under the above\\n\\ninterpretation of subsection (f), juveniles adjudicated delinquent could\\n\\ntheoretically apply to terminate their registration requirements immediately\\n\\nafter the requirements are imposed. They submit that such an outcome is\\n\\ninconsistent with the purpose and operation of Megan’s Law.\\n\\n      To shoulder their burden, registrants must present proofs that satisfy the\\n\\npublic safety prong in subsection (f) by clear and convincing evidence. As part\\n\\nof the fact-intensive inquiry the law calls for, offenders generally present\\n\\npsychological evaluations; proof they have successfully completed sex\\n\\noffender treatment, counseling, and therapy; and evidence of employment,\\n\\namong other things.\\n\\n      To develop a persuasive record of rehabilitation takes time. Judges\\n\\ncommonly look to whether an individual has made progress over a period of\\n\\ntime both during confinement and afterward in the community. With that in\\n\\nmind, although the offense-free prong of subsection (f) does not apply to\\n\\njuveniles adjudicated delinquent, proof of the commission of a later offense\\n\\nwould be relevant to assess whether a person poses a public safety risk.\\n\\n      In reality, an application filed immediately after a person’s reporting\\n\\nobligation begins is unlikely to succeed. And a trial judge’s individualized\\n\\nfindings on a motion under subsection (f) are subject to appellate review.\\n\\n                                        23\\n                                        D.\\n\\n      In In re Registrant H.D., the Court held that individuals who apply to\\n\\nterminate their Megan’s Law requirements must demonstrate they have been\\n\\noffense-free for fifteen years from the time of conviction for the predicate sex\\n\\noffense or release from a correctional facility, whichever is later. 241 N.J. 412,\\n\\n421 (2020). The fifteen-year look-back period does not reset after the\\n\\ncommission of a later offense. Ibid. The same principle applies to juveniles\\n\\nconvicted of an offense. We do not adopt the contrary statement in R.H. See\\n\\n475 N.J. Super. at 471.\\n\\n                                       VI.\\n\\n      We now apply the above principles to R.H. and T.L. Both were\\n\\nadjudicated delinquent of aggravated sexual assault. Because they were not\\n\\nconvicted of an offense, subsection (f)’s first prong -- the requirement to\\n\\nremain offense-free for fifteen years -- does not apply to them.\\n\\n      To be eligible to terminate their Megan’s Law obligations, R.H. and T.L.\\n\\nmust each satisfy the second prong and demonstrate they are “not likely to\\n\\npose a threat to the safety of others.” N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f).\\n\\n      R.H. presented a report by a psychologist who evaluated him in October\\n\\n2020 and concluded he “is not likely to commit another sexual offense” and\\n\\n“does not present a risk of harm to others in the community.” In light of the\\n\\n                                       24\\n trial court’s ruling on the statutory question, the court did not reach or make a\\n\\nfinding about whether he poses a threat to the safety of others.\\n\\n      T.L. presented a report from a psychologist who evaluated him in March\\n\\n2022. She concluded that T.L. “present[ed] a low risk of engaging in future\\n\\nacts of sexually inappropriate behaviors” and was “not likely to pose a threat\\n\\nto others in the community.” The trial court rejected T.L.’s application based\\n\\non its understanding of the scope of subsection (f). The court “recognize[d]”\\n\\nthe psychologist’s conclusion but did not make a finding on that issue.\\n\\n      Accordingly, we remand each matter to the appropriate trial court to\\n\\ndetermine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that R.H. and T.L.\\n\\nsatisfy subsection (f)’s public safety prong.\\n\\n      Because we resolve these appeals on statutory grounds, we do not\\n\\naddress arguments about whether the doctrine of constitutional avoidance\\n\\nshould apply.\\n\\n                                       VII.\\n\\n      For the reasons stated above, we find that the first prong of subsection\\n\\n(f) -- which requires proof that an individual has been offense-free for fifteen\\n\\nyears -- does not apply to R.H. and T.L. because they were adjudicated\\n\\ndelinquent, and not convicted, of a sex offense. We therefore reverse the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        25\\n judgment of the Appellate Division and remand both matters to the trial court\\n\\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n     JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON, PIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER APTER,\\nFASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER’s opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       26\\n '),\n",

It has been prepared by the Office\\nof the Clerk for the convenience of the reader. It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n        David Goyco v. Progressive Insurance Company (A-12-23) (088497)\\n\\nArgued January 29, 2024 -- Decided May 14, 2024\\n\\nSOLOMON, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court considers whether the operator of a low-speed\\nelectric scooter (LSES) is a “pedestrian” entitled to personal injury protection (PIP)\\nbenefits under the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, N.J.S.A. 39:6A-\\n1 to -35, commonly known as the No-Fault Act.\\n\\n       In November 2021, an automobile struck and injured plaintiff David Goyco\\nwhile he was operating an LSES that has two wheels connected by a floorboard, as\\nwell as handlebars, a headlight, brake light, speedometer, and electric motor. Goyco\\nmade a claim for PIP benefits under his personal automobile policy with defendant\\nProgressive Insurance Company. Progressive denied Goyco’s claim. It concluded\\nthat coverage was not required under Goyco’s policy, which tracks N.J.S.A. 39:6A-\\n4, because the LSES Goyco operated at the time of the accident did not meet the\\ndefinition of an “automobile,” and Goyco could not be considered a “pedestrian.”\\n\\n      Goyco filed a verified complaint, asserting that LSES riders should be deemed\\n“pedestrians” entitled to PIP benefits under the No-Fault Act in light of the 2019\\nenactment of N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g), which provides that an LSES should be\\nconsidered equivalent to a bicycle -- with bicyclists having been deemed pedestrians\\nunder the No-Fault Act -- except in statutory provisions that clearly do not apply to\\nan LSES. The trial court denied relief to Goyco, and the Appellate Division\\naffirmed. The Court granted Goyco’s petition for certification. \\n255 N.J. 429\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: An LSES rider does not fall within the definition of “pedestrian” for\\npurposes of the No-Fault Act. Goyco is not entitled to PIP benefits.\\n\\n1. With the goals of providing prompt payment of medical expenses arising from an\\nautomobile accident, regardless of fault, and containing the rising cost of automobile\\ninsurance premiums, the No-Fault Act requires in part that every New Jersey\\nautomobile liability insurance policy provide PIP benefits (1) when the covered\\nindividual is “occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile”; or\\n(2) when the covered individual is a pedestrian. N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4. “For the\\n\\n                                          1\\n purposes of [the No-Fault Act],” a “pedestrian” is defined as “any person who is not\\noccupying, entering into, or alighting from a vehicle propelled by other than\\nmuscular power and designed primarily for use on highways, rails and tracks.”\\nN.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h). (pp. 8-11)\\n\\n2. “Vehicle” is not defined in the No-Fault Act. Plaintiff suggests that the Court\\nshould therefore apply the definition from N.J.S.A. 39:1-1, which would exclude an\\nLSES. That is not appropriate for several reasons. First, N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 is prefaced\\nby a limiting introductory clause stating that the definitions listed refer to terms\\n“[a]s used in this subtitle.” Because the No-Fault Act is contained in different\\nsubtitle, the definitions in N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 do not apply to it. The sole exception\\nwithin the No-Fault Act -- N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(j), which expressly incorporates a\\ndefinition from N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 -- proves the rule that a similar reference should not\\nsimply be inferred elsewhere, which would render the reference in (j) meaningless.\\nAnd the Legislature has instructed that statutes should be interpreted by giving each\\nword its “generally accepted meaning” unless a “different meaning is expressly\\nindicated,” see N.J.S.A. 1:1-1, which corresponds with traditional principles of\\nstatutory construction. The Court therefore reviews definitions of “vehicle” and\\nconcludes that an LSES fits within the ordinary meaning of the term. (pp. 11-16)\\n\\n3. Further, at the time of the accident, Goyco’s LSES was “propelled by other than\\nmuscular power” because it used an electric motor with a rechargeable battery and\\nwas not designed to be propelled by muscular power. And plaintiff’s LSES was\\n“designed primarily for use on highways” based on its features and the broad\\nordinary definition of that term. In sum, plaintiff was occupying a vehicle propelled\\nby other than muscular power and designed primarily for use on highways, and he\\nwas therefore not a “pedestrian” for purposes of the No-Fault Act. (pp. 16-19)\\n\\n4. The Court rejects Goyco’s reliance on N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g). First, it is unclear\\nwhether that 2019 statute, codified in Subtitle 1 of Title 39, was intended to have\\nany effect on statutes in Subtitle 2. Second, the conclusion that bicyclists are\\npedestrians under the No-Fault Act is rooted in N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h)’s definition of\\n“pedestrian,” which “by [its] nature may have no application to low-speed electric\\nbicycles or low-speed electric scooters.” N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g). Expanding the\\ndefinition of “pedestrian” to include LSES operators would be a policy decision with\\ninsurance cost implications that is properly for the Legislature, not the Court.\\n(pp. 19-23)\\n\\n      AFFIRMED as modified.\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, PIERRE-LOUIS,\\nWAINER APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE SOLOMON’s\\nopinion.\\n                                          2\\n        SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\\n             A-12 September Term 2023\\n                        088497\\n\\n\\n                      David Goyco,\\n                 Plaintiff-Appellant,\\n\\n                           v.\\n\\n          Progressive Insurance Company,\\n\\n               Defendant-Respondent.\\n\\n        On certification to the Superior Court,\\n                  Appellate Division.\\n\\n       Argued                      Decided\\n   January 29, 2024              May 14, 2024\\n\\n\\nChristian C.

Tallmadge and Siena Carnevale, on\\n            the brief).\\n\\n\\n           JUSTICE SOLOMON delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n      In this case, we are called upon to decide whether the operator of a low-\\n\\nspeed electric scooter (LSES) is entitled to personal injury protection (PIP)\\n\\nbenefits under the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, N.J.S.A.\\n\\n39:6A-1 to -35, commonly known as the No-Fault Act.\\n\\n      The No-Fault Act requires insurance companies to provide PIP benefits\\n\\nto insured individuals in two circumstances: (1) when the covered individual\\n\\nis “occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile”; or (2)\\n\\nwhen the covered individual is a pedestrian. N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4. The No-Fault\\n\\nAct defines “pedestrian” as “any person who is not occupying, entering into, or\\n\\nalighting from a vehicle propelled by other than muscular power and designed\\n\\nprimarily for use on highways, rails and tracks.” N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h).\\n\\n      The parties do not dispute that plaintiff David Goyco’s insurance policy\\n\\nwith defendant Progressive Insurance Company (Progressive) must comply\\n\\nwith those mandatory statutory provisions. What the parties contest is whether\\n\\nplaintiff was a “pedestrian” within the meaning of the No-Fault Act and, by\\n\\n\\n                                        2\\n extension, the policy. Plaintiff argues that LSES riders should be deemed\\n\\n“pedestrians” entitled to PIP benefits under the No-Fault Act in light of the\\n\\n2019 enactment of N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g), which provides that an LSES\\n\\nshould be considered equivalent to a bicycle except in statutory provisions that\\n\\nclearly do not apply to an LSES.\\n\\n      For the reasons that follow, we hold that an LSES rider does not fall\\n\\nwithin the definition of “pedestrian” for purposes of the No-Fault Act because\\n\\nthe LSES is “a vehicle propelled by other than muscular power and designed\\n\\nprimarily for use on highways, rails and tracks.” N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h).\\n\\nTherefore, Goyco is not entitled to PIP benefits, and we affirm as modified the\\n\\njudgment of the Appellate Division.\\n\\n                                       I.\\n\\n      On November 22, 2021, an automobile struck and injured Goyco while\\n\\nhe was operating a “Segway Ninebot KickScooter Max” in Elizabeth, New\\n\\nJersey. The “Segway Ninebot KickScooter Max” is an LSES that has two\\n\\nwheels connected by a floorboard, as well as handlebars, a headlight, brake\\n\\nlight, and speedometer. Pursuant to its owner’s manual, the LSES is designed\\n\\nto be operated using its rechargeable battery, which powers its electric motor.\\n\\n      Goyco sustained injuries from the accident and incurred medical\\n\\nexpenses. At the time of the accident, Goyco was the named insured under a\\n\\n                                        3\\n personal automobile policy with Progressive. Goyco reported the accident and\\n\\nmade a claim for PIP benefits under the policy, which provided -- in terms that\\n\\ntrack N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4 -- that the insured could receive PIP benefits for\\n\\ninjuries sustained in an accident “1. while occupying, entering into, alighting\\n\\nfrom, getting on, getting off of, loading, unloading, or using an automobile; or\\n\\n2. as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or\\n\\nfrom an automobile.” The policy defines “automobile” in terms that track\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(a), and it defines “pedestrian” as “any person who is not\\n\\noccupying a vehicle propelled by other than muscular power and designed\\n\\nprimarily for use on highways, rails and tracks.” (emphasis added). That\\n\\nlanguage similarly tracks the No-Fault Act. See N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h). The\\n\\npolicy does not define “vehicle.”\\n\\n      Progressive denied Goyco’s claim for PIP benefits. Progressive\\n\\nconcluded that the LSES Goyco operated at the time of the accident did not\\n\\nmeet the definition of an “automobile,” and Goyco could not be considered a\\n\\n“pedestrian” because he was “driving” the LSES at the time of the accident.\\n\\n      Goyco filed a verified complaint and an order to show cause, asking the\\n\\ntrial court to direct Progressive to pay all reasonable medical expenses\\n\\nincurred to treat his injuries. At oral argument, Goyco asserted that an LSES\\n\\nis akin to a bicycle pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g) and that, under New\\n\\n                                       4\\n Jersey case law, bicycle riders are considered “pedestrians” within the\\n\\nmeaning of the No-Fault Act. Goyco argued that an LSES is akin to a bicycle,\\n\\nand therefore he was a “pedestrian” for purposes of PIP benefits. In\\n\\nopposition, Progressive argued that an LSES is not an “automobile” under the\\n\\nNo-Fault Act and Goyco does not qualify as a “pedestrian” because the LSES\\n\\nis motorized.\\n\\n      The trial court determined that an LSES is not an automobile under the\\n\\nstatute or the policy. In addition, the court concluded that Goyco could not\\n\\nrely on N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g) to support the contention that an LSES is like a\\n\\nbicycle for purposes of PIP benefits because that provision is not part of the\\n\\nNo-Fault Act. The trial court noted further that the No-Fault Act contains no\\n\\nmention of “bicycles,” and any reference to bicycles in N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g)\\n\\nor any other provisions of Chapter 4 has no impact on Chapter 6A, which\\n\\nhouses the No-Fault Act. Finally, the trial court determined that “[t]he plain\\n\\nlanguage and nature of the definition of a ‘pedestrian’ in accordance with [the\\n\\nNo-Fault Act] clearly has no application to an [LSES].” The trial court thus\\n\\ndenied relief to Goyco.\\n\\n      Goyco appealed, and the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court’s\\n\\njudgment. First, the Appellate Division found that Goyco was not a\\n\\n“pedestrian” within the plain language of the No-Fault Act because an LSES is\\n\\n                                        5\\n a “vehicle propelled by other than muscular power” that meets the definition of\\n\\na “[l]ow-speed electric scooter” in N.J.S.A. 39:1-1. The Appellate Division\\n\\nalso rejected the argument that N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g) likens an LSES operator\\n\\nto a bicyclist. Relying on the text of N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g), the Appellate\\n\\nDivision found that the statute’s exception overcame Goyco’s argument: “all\\n\\nstatutes . . . rules, and regulations applicable to bicycles . . . shall apply to [an\\n\\nLSES] except those provisions which by their very nature may have no\\n\\napplication to . . . [an LSES].” (emphasis added).\\n\\n      We granted Goyco’s petition for certification, \\n255 N.J. 429\\n (2023), as\\n\\nwell as the motions of the New Jersey Association for Justice (NJAJ), the New\\n\\nJersey Defense Association (NJDA), and the New Jersey Property-Liability\\n\\nInsurance Guaranty Association (NJPLIGA) to appear as amici curiae.\\n\\n                                          II.\\n\\n                                          A.\\n\\n      Goyco urges this Court to apply N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g) and interpret\\n\\n“pedestrian” to include an LSES operator, just as it includes bicyclists. Goyco\\n\\nfirst argues that N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g) supports the assertion that an LSES is\\n\\nakin to a bicycle because it provides, in part, that “all statutes . . . rules and\\n\\nregulations applicable to bicycles . . . shall apply to [an LSES].” Second,\\n\\nGoyco contends that the Appellate Division misapplied the exception in\\n\\n                                          6\\n N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g), which excludes “those provisions which by their very\\n\\nnature may have no application to . . . [an LSES].”\\n\\n      Amicus curiae NJAJ agrees with Goyco that N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g)\\n\\nshould apply here. In addition, NJAJ argues that the No-Fault Act’s definition\\n\\nof “pedestrian” requires that the LSES be “propelled by other than muscular\\n\\npower and designed primarily for use on highways, rails, and tracks.”\\n\\n(emphasis added) (quoting N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h)). Arguing that an LSES does\\n\\nnot meet the second part of that definition, NJAJ argues that an LSES operator\\n\\nfalls within the definition of “pedestrian” and is entitled to PIP benefits.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      Progressive claims that N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g) does not apply here\\n\\nbecause it explicitly excludes “those provisions which by their very nature\\n\\nmay have no application to . . . [an LSES]” and that the definition of\\n\\n“pedestrian” in the No-Fault Act, N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h), is such a provision.\\n\\nTurning to extrinsic evidence, Progressive claims that N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16 is\\n\\ninapplicable to the No-Fault Act because it was implemented to combat\\n\\nclimate change -- not to expand the applicability of PIP benefits in the No-\\n\\nFault Act.\\n\\n      Amici NJDA and NJPLIGA agree with and largely reiterate\\n\\nProgressive’s arguments, asserting that the trial court and the Appellate\\n\\n                                         7\\n Division’s application of N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h) to bar Goyco’s claim for PIP\\n\\nbenefits was consistent with the terms of the statute and the Legislature’s\\n\\nintent. In addition, NJDA and NJPLIGA express concern that expanding\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h) to include LSES operators will increase the cost of\\n\\nautomobile insurance premiums, which would ultimately defeat the\\n\\nLegislature’s intent in passing the No-Fault Act.\\n\\n      Amicus curiae NJPLIGA notes that the exception in N.J.S.A. 39:4-\\n\\n14.16(g) precludes application to statutory provisions like N.J.S.A. 39:6A-\\n\\n2(h), because N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g) has no relevance to an LSES, as\\n\\nevidenced by the fact that the No-Fault Act makes no reference to “bicycles.”\\n\\nIn addition, NJPLIGA argues that it is outside this Court’s authority to utilize a\\n\\nprovision from another chapter to expand the definition of “pedestrian” in the\\n\\nNo-Fault Act to include an LSES.\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n      Enacted in 1972, see L. 1972, c. 70, the No-Fault Act had two primary\\n\\ngoals: (1) “to provide prompt payment of medical expenses arising from an\\n\\nautomobile accident, regardless of fault,” and (2) “to contain the rising cost of\\n\\nautomobile insurance premiums,” Cooper Hosp. Univ. Med. Ctr. v. Selective\\n\\nIns. Co. of Am., \\n249 N.J. 174\\n, 179 (2021).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        8\\n       To further these goals, the No-Fault Act requires in part that “every\\n\\nowner or registered owner of an automobile registered or principally garaged\\n\\nin” New Jersey “maintain automobile liability insurance coverage.” N.J.S.A.\\n\\n39:6A-3. And, of particular relevance here, the Act directs that\\n\\n            every standard automobile liability insurance policy . . .\\n            shall contain [PIP] benefits for the payment of benefits\\n            without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any\\n            kind, to the named insured and members of his family\\n            residing in his household who sustain bodily injury as\\n            a result of an accident while occupying, entering into,\\n            alighting from or using an automobile, or as a\\n            pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object\\n            propelled by or from an automobile, and to other\\n            persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying,\\n            entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of\\n            the named insured, with permission of the named\\n            insured.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4.]\\n\\n“Under No-Fault, automobile insurers are required to provide PIP coverage to\\n\\ntheir insureds, without consideration of fault, and are prohibited from asserting\\n\\nsubrogation claims seeking reimbursement of medical expenses against the at-\\n\\nfault insured’s PIP provider.” Palisades Ins. Co. v. Horizon Blue Cross Blue\\n\\nShield of N.J., \\n469 N.J. Super. 30\\n, 38 (App. Div. 2021).\\n\\n      In this appeal, we review the contours of N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4 to determine\\n\\nwhether plaintiff falls under that provision as a “pedestrian” within the\\n\\nmeaning of the statute. Our review is de novo and owes “no deference to the\\n\\n                                        9\\n legal conclusions reached by the trial court and Appellate Division.” W.S. v.\\n\\nHildreth, \\n252 N.J. 506\\n, 518 (2023). In construing the statute, we aim to\\n\\neffectuate the Legislature’s intent, which is often best indicated through the\\n\\nstatute’s language. Gilleran v. Township of Bloomfield, \\n227 N.J. 159\\n, 171\\n\\n(2016). This Court “ascribe[s] to the statutory words their ordinary meaning\\n\\nand significance and read[s] them in context with related provisions so as to\\n\\ngive sense to the legislation as a whole.” DiProspero v. Penn, \\n183 N.J. 477\\n,\\n\\n492 (2005) (citation omitted). “When the plain language of a statute is clear\\n\\nand unambiguous, we apply the law as written.” W.S., 252 N.J. at 518. If the\\n\\nstatutory language is ambiguous, however, we may use extrinsic evidence to\\n\\naid our inquiry. DiProspero, \\n183 N.J. at 492-93\\n.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2 is the definitional section of the No-Fault Act. The list\\n\\nof definitions provided in its subsections -- (a) through (o) -- are preceded by\\n\\nthe introductory phrase, “[a]s used in this act,” which is followed by a colon.\\n\\nIbid.\\n “[I]n this act” plainly refers to the No-Fault Act. See DeSimone v.\\n\\nSpringpoint Senior Living, Inc., \\n256 N.J. 172\\n, 185 (2024) (underscoring that\\n\\nphrases like “[f]or the purposes of this act” have been used in the context of\\n\\nconsumer fraud legislation to refer to the specific legislative enactment to\\n\\nwhich the phrase belongs).\\n\\n                                       10\\n       Thus, “[f]or the purposes of [the No-Fault Act],” a “pedestrian” is\\n\\ndefined as “any person who is not occupying, entering into, or alighting from a\\n\\nvehicle propelled by other than muscular power and designed primarily for use\\n\\non highways, rails and tracks.” N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h). Here, it is undisputed\\n\\nthat plaintiff was “occupying” his LSES at the time of the accident. To\\n\\ndetermine whether he was nonetheless a “pedestrian” within the meaning of\\n\\nthe statute, we must therefore determine (1) whether the LSES is a vehicle; (2)\\n\\nwhether it is “propelled by other than muscular power”; and (3) whether it is\\n\\n“designed primarily for use on highways, rails and tracks.”\\n\\n                                        1.\\n\\n      “Vehicle” is not defined in the No-Fault Act. Plaintiff suggests that we\\n\\nshould therefore look to the definition of “vehicle” in N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 -- “every\\n\\ndevice in, upon which, or by which a person or property is or may be\\n\\ntransported upon a highway, excepting devices moved by human power or\\n\\nused exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks or low-speed electric bicycles,\\n\\nlow-speed electric scooters, or motorized bicycles” -- and apply that definition\\n\\nwithin the No-Fault Act. That is not appropriate for several reasons.\\n\\n      First, just as N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2 has an introductory clause limiting the\\n\\napplication of its definitions, N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 is prefaced by its own limiting\\n\\nintroductory clause, which states that the definitions listed refer to terms “[a]s\\n\\n                                        11\\n used in this subtitle.” (emphasis added). Given that N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 is\\n\\ncontained within Subtitle 1 of Title 39, it follows that its definitions apply to\\n\\nthe entirety of Subtitle 1 only -- which includes Chapters 1 through 5H of New\\n\\nJersey’s Motor Vehicle and Traffic Laws. N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 to -5H. Because\\n\\nthe No-Fault Act is contained in Subtitle 2, Chapter 6A, the definitions in\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 39:1-1 do not apply to the Act.\\n\\n       Indeed, certain terms are defined differently in the No-Fault Act than\\n\\nthey are in Chapter 1. “Pedestrian” itself is an example: in contrast to its\\n\\nmulti-part definition in the No-Fault Act, the term is defined simply as “a\\n\\nperson afoot” in N.J.S.A. 39:1-1. Similarly, the lengthy definition of\\n\\n“automobile” provided in N.J.S.A. 29:6A-2(a) 1 is distinct from the meaning of\\n\\n“all motor vehicles except motorcycles” found in N.J.S.A. 39:1-1.\\n\\n\\n1\\n    Under the No-Fault Act,\\n\\n             “Automobile” means a private passenger automobile of\\n             a private passenger or station wagon type that is owned\\n             or hired and is neither used as a public or livery\\n             conveyance for passengers nor rented to others with a\\n             driver; and a motor vehicle with a pickup body, a\\n             delivery sedan, a van, or a panel truck or a camper type\\n             vehicle used for recreational purposes owned by an\\n             individual or by husband and wife who are residents of\\n             the same household, not customarily used in the\\n             occupation, profession or business of the insured other\\n             than farming or ranching. An automobile owned by a\\n             farm family copartnership or corporation, which is\\n\\n                                        12\\n       Such statutory differences and distinct definitions are not surprising in\\n\\nlight of the structure of Title 39 and the disparate types of laws it contains.\\n\\nSubtitle 1, labeled “Motor Vehicles Generally; Traffic Laws,” establishes the\\n\\nrules of the road and provides for their enforcement, whereas Subtitle 2,\\n\\n“Additional Motor Vehicle Regulations,” establishes rules for processes such\\n\\nas financing, owning, maintaining, and insuring motor vehicles. We do not\\n\\nsuggest that all chapters within the two subtitles follow the same definitions;\\n\\nrather, we highlight the diverse subjects of regulation covered within Title 39\\n\\nto illustrate why -- in addition to the limiting language of the definitional\\n\\nsections themselves -- a definition from one chapter cannot simply be imported\\n\\ninto another chapter of Title 39.\\n\\n      The sole exception within the No-Fault Act proves that rule. In N.J.S.A.\\n\\n39:6A-2(j), the Legislature expressly provided that, for purposes of the No-\\n\\nFault Act, “‘[m]otor vehicle’ means a motor vehicle as defined in [N.J.S.A.]\\n\\n39:1-1, exclusive of an automobile as defined in subsection a. of this section.”\\n\\n(emphasis added). The fact that subsection (j) explicitly references N.J.S.A.\\n\\n\\n\\n            principally garaged on a farm or ranch and otherwise\\n            meets the definitions contained in this section, shall be\\n            considered a private passenger automobile owned by\\n            two or more relatives resident in the same household.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(a).]\\n                                        13\\n 39:1-1 strongly supports that a similar reference should not simply be inferred\\n\\nelsewhere, which would render the reference in (j) meaningless. See Burgos v.\\n\\nState, \\n222 N.J. 175\\n, 203 (2015) (“We do not support interpretations that render\\n\\nstatutory language as surplusage or meaningless . . . .”). And the fact that\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(j) exempts from the referenced definition of “motor vehicle”\\n\\n“an automobile as defined in subsection a. of this section” (emphasis added) --\\n\\nas opposed to an automobile as defined in N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 -- reinforces the\\n\\nexceptional nature of the incorporation of the definition of “motor vehicle”\\n\\nfrom that statute into the No-Fault Act.\\n\\n      Another reason not to look to a statute beyond the No-Fault Act to\\n\\ndefine “vehicle” for purposes of the Act is that the Legislature has instructed\\n\\nus to interpret a statute by giving each word its “generally accepted meaning”\\n\\nunless a “different meaning is expressly indicated”:\\n\\n            In the construction of the laws and statutes of this state,\\n            both civil and criminal, words and phrases shall be read\\n            and construed with their context, and shall, unless\\n            inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature\\n            or unless another or different meaning is expressly\\n            indicated, be given their generally accepted meaning,\\n            according to the approved usage of the language.\\n            Technical words and phrases, and words and phrases\\n            having a special or accepted meaning in the law, shall\\n            be construed in accordance with such technical or\\n            special and accepted meaning.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 1:1-1 (emphasis added).]\\n\\n                                        14\\n Those instructions correspond with traditional principles of statutory\\n\\nconstruction. See DiProspero, \\n183 N.J. at 492\\n.\\n\\n      Here, we find -- in light of the limiting language of the definitional\\n\\nstatutes and the express reference to N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 within a single definition\\n\\nfrom the No-Fault Act -- that it is neither inconsistent with legislative intent\\n\\nnor contrary to any express indication of meaning to look to and apply the\\n\\nordinary meaning of “vehicle” in interpreting the term as used in N.J.S.A.\\n\\n39:6A-2(h).\\n\\n      “Vehicle” has been variously defined as “[a]n instrument of\\n\\ntransportation or conveyance,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1868 (11th ed. 2019);\\n\\n“a thing used for transporting people or goods, esp. on land, such as a car,\\n\\ntruck, or cart,” New Oxford American Dictionary 1864 (2d ed. 2005); “any\\n\\nmeans in or by which someone travels or something is carried or conveyed; a\\n\\nmeans of conveyance or transport” or “a conveyance moving on wheels,\\n\\nrunners, tracks, or the like, as a cart, sled, automobile, tractor, etc.,” Random\\n\\nHouse Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged) 1583 (1965); and “a\\n\\nmeans of carrying or transporting something,” 2 Websters New International\\n\\nDictionary 2538 (3d ed. 1981).\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n “Vehicle” is still defined as “a means of carrying or transporting something.”\\nMerriam-Webster 1386 (11th ed. 2020).\\n                                      15\\n       An LSES clearly falls within those ordinary definitions of the term, and\\n\\nwe conclude that it is therefore a “vehicle” for purposes of the No-Fault Act.\\n\\n                                       2.\\n\\n      Next, we consider whether plaintiff’s LSES is “propelled by other than\\n\\nmuscular power.”\\n\\n      The Appellate Division has recognized, and we agree, that “[t]he\\n\\npurpose and character of [a] vehicle are determinative of whether one is to be\\n\\ncovered for PIP benefits as a pedestrian.” Nunag v. Pa. Nat. Mut. Cas. Ins.\\n\\nCo., \\n224 N.J. Super. 753\\n, 757 (App. Div. 1988). In Nunag, the Appellate\\n\\nDivision considered an issue like the one presented here: whether an insurance\\n\\ncompany was required to pay PIP benefits to an insured who suffered injuries\\n\\nwhen her moped was struck by an automobile. \\nId. at 754-55\\n. The plaintiff, a\\n\\nmember of the insured’s household, argued -- like Goyco -- that she was a\\n\\npedestrian while riding her moped. \\nId. at 755\\n. The court noted that not “all\\n\\nmopeds are always . . . vehicles ‘propelled by other than muscular power’” as\\n\\n“certain mopeds have dual capacity and can be propelled in a completely\\n\\nmuscular power mode by disengaging the engine.” \\nId. at 757-58\\n. Still, the\\n\\ncourt found that the plaintiff’s moped “was clearly being used as one propelled\\n\\nby other than muscular power” because “[i]t was [the] plaintiff’s clear\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       16\\n intention to continue under motor power, rather than to utilize the machine as a\\n\\nbicycle and to travel under muscular power.” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      Based on the evidence presented here, we find that, at the time of the\\n\\naccident, Goyco’s LSES was “propelled by other than muscular power”\\n\\nbecause it used an electric motor with a rechargeable battery. Critically,\\n\\nGoyco’s LSES was not designed to be propelled by muscular power. Our\\n\\ninquiry, however, does not end with that conclusion.\\n\\n                                        3.\\n\\n      We next turn to the final requirement in the definition and consider\\n\\nwhether an LSES is “designed primarily for use on highways, rails and tracks.”\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h). Amicus curiae NJAJ contends that an LSES is not\\n\\n“designed primarily for use on highways, rails and tracks,” meaning Goyco is\\n\\na “pedestrian” for purposes of obtaining PIP coverage.\\n\\n      In Lane v. Prudential Property & Casualty Insurance Co., the Appellate\\n\\nDivision considered whether a child riding a motor bike was entitled to PIP\\n\\nbenefits. \\n196 N.J. Super. 504\\n, 505-06 (App. Div. 1984). The motor bike had\\n\\nno speedometer; its handbrake had been disconnected; and it “bore no license\\n\\nplate, headlights, taillight or turn signals.” \\nId. at 506\\n. Nevertheless, the court\\n\\nfound that the child was not a pedestrian because “the vehicle was capable of\\n\\ntraveling 30 to 40 miles per hour and could not be propelled other than by a\\n\\n                                        17\\n motor.” \\nId. at 510\\n. The fact that the motor bike “did not have a license plate,\\n\\nheadlights, taillight or turn signals and that its handbrake had been\\n\\ndisconnected [did] not mitigate against the trial judge’s finding that it was\\n\\n‘designed primarily for use on highways.’” \\nIbid.\\n\\n\\n      Applying the ordinary definition of “highway” as we did for “vehicle,”\\n\\nsee N.J.S.A. 1:1-1; DiProspero, \\n183 N.J. at 492\\n, we find that plaintiff’s LSES\\n\\nwas likewise “designed primarily for use on highways,” see Lane, \\n196 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. at 510\\n.\\n\\n      “Highway” has been variously defined as “[b]roadly, any main route on\\n\\nland, on water, or in the air,” or “[a] free and public roadway or street that\\n\\nevery person may use,” Black’s Law Dictionary at 876; “a main road, esp. one\\n\\nconnecting major towns or cities,” or “(chiefly in official use) a public road,”\\n\\nOxford New American at 798; “a main road, esp. one between towns or cities,”\\n\\nor “any public passage, either a road or waterway,” or “any main or ordinary\\n\\nroute, track or course,” Random House at 671; “a road or way on land or water\\n\\nthat is open to public use as a matter of right whether or not a thoroughfare: a\\n\\npublic road or way (as a footpath, road, or waterway),” Webster’s at 1069.\\n\\n      Goyco’s LSES can travel 15.5 miles per hour and has a headlight, brake\\n\\nlight, and speedometer -- several features that the motor bike in Lane did not\\n\\nhave. The LSES’s owner’s manual provides that LSES operators must\\n\\n                                        18\\n “[c]omply with local laws and regulations when riding th[e] product.” An\\n\\nLSES is “designed primarily for use on highways” within the broad ordinary\\n\\nmeaning of that term and, thus, within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h).\\n\\n      Once again, the No-Fault Act mandates PIP coverage for a “pedestrian,”\\n\\nthat is, “any person who is not occupying, entering into, or alighting from a\\n\\nvehicle propelled by other than muscular power and designed primarily for use\\n\\non highways, rails and tracks.” N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h), -4 (emphases added).\\n\\nUpon close review of those requirements, we have concluded that plaintiff was\\n\\na person who was occupying a vehicle propelled by other than muscular power\\n\\nand designed primarily for use on highways. We therefore find that plaintiff is\\n\\nnot a “pedestrian” for purposes of the No-Fault Act.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      Plaintiff argues that a statute enacted in 2019 reveals legislative intent\\n\\nthat LSES riders be considered “pedestrians” under the much earlier No-Fault\\n\\nAct. N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16 governs the “[o]peration of low-speed electric\\n\\nbicycle[s] or scooter[s].” The statute specifies that LSES “may be operated on\\n\\nthe streets, highways, roadways, and bicycle paths of this State,” subject to\\n\\ncertain exceptions, “and may be parked on a sidewalk.” \\nId.\\n at (a). And the\\n\\nstatute states that,\\n\\n             [e]xcept as otherwise provided by this section, all\\n             statutes, including the provisions of chapter 4 of Title\\n                                        19\\n             39 of the Revised Statutes, rules, and regulations\\n            applicable to bicycles, as defined in [N.J.S.A. 39:4-\\n            10.1], shall apply to low-speed electric bicycles and\\n            low-speed electric scooters, except those provisions\\n            which by their very nature may have no application to\\n            low-speed electric bicycles or low-speed electric\\n            scooters.\\n\\n            [Id. at (g).]\\n\\n      Relying on subsection (g), plaintiff argues that, because the regulations\\n\\napplicable to a bicycle also apply to an LSES, and because we have held that a\\n\\nbicyclist is a pedestrian for purposes of the No-Fault Act, see Darel v. Pa.\\n\\nMfrs. Asso. Ins. Co., \\n114 N.J. 416\\n, 419 (1989) (“Plaintiff, as operator of a\\n\\nbicycle, was within the definition of a ‘pedestrian’ in N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h)\\n\\n. . . .”), an LSES rider must also be a pedestrian for purposes of the No-Fault\\n\\nAct. That syllogism, however, is not persuasive.\\n\\n      First, it is unclear whether the 2019 statute -- governing the operation of\\n\\nvehicles in keeping with Chapter 4 and Subtitle 1 of Title 39 -- was intended to\\n\\nhave any effect on statutes in Subtitle 2, pertaining to ownership concerns such\\n\\nas insurance. Even putting aside the topical disparity between N.J.S.A. 39:4-\\n\\n14.16(g) and the No-Fault Act, however, we find that the 2019 statute does not\\n\\ncall for LSES riders to be deemed “pedestrians” for purposes of the Act.\\n\\n      The conclusion that bicyclists are pedestrians under the No-Fault Act is\\n\\nrooted in N.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h)’s definition of “pedestrian”: unlike an LSES, a\\n\\n                                       20\\n bicycle is not “propelled by other than muscular power.” See Nunag, \\n224 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. at 757\\n (finding that the plaintiff, who was riding a motorized bicycle,\\n\\nwas not a “pedestrian” within the meaning of the No-Fault Act because “[i]t\\n\\nwas plaintiff’s clear intention to continue under motor power, rather than to\\n\\nutilize the machine as a bicycle and to travel under muscular power”).\\n\\nBecause an LSES is “propelled by other than muscular power” and is also a\\n\\n“vehicle” “designed primarily for use on highways,” the definition of\\n\\n“pedestrian” “by [its] very nature may have no application to low-speed\\n\\nelectric bicycles or low-speed electric scooters.” See N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g).\\n\\n      Plaintiff’s policy arguments are similarly unavailing in light of the clear\\n\\nstatutory text. Plaintiff asserts that the No-Fault Act was “enacted as social\\n\\nlegislation in 1972 to be liberally construed to provide the public with personal\\n\\ninjury protection coverage as a social necessity which should be given the\\n\\nbroadest application consistent with the statutory language.” Although the\\n\\ngoal of assuring medical coverage is a key aim of the Act, it is balanced\\n\\nagainst the Act’s other main goal of “contain[ing] the rising cost of automobile\\n\\ninsurance premiums.” See Cooper Hosp., 249 N.J. at 179. Expanding the\\n\\ndefinition of “pedestrian” to include LSES operators would advance the\\n\\nmedical coverage goal but undermine the goal of curbing the rise of insurance\\n\\ncosts. See ibid. The Legislature may certainly choose to expand the\\n\\n                                       21\\n availability of PIP coverage to LSES operators, as they did with motorcycles,\\n\\nsee N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.3, but that policy decision and its insurance cost\\n\\nimplications, if any, is properly for the Legislature, not the Court.\\n\\n      In short, we agree with the Appellate Division’s conclusion that Goyco\\n\\nis not entitled to PIP benefits because he is not a pedestrian pursuant to\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 39:6A-2(h). Rather than look to the definition of a “[l]ow-speed\\n\\nelectric scooter” in N.J.S.A. 39:1-1, however, we rely on the plain language of\\n\\nthe No-Fault Act and the ordinary meanings of the undefined terms it uses; we\\n\\nalso find the lack of relationship between Chapters 4 and 6A of Title 39 is\\n\\nrelevant to show that N.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16(g) does not render an LSES rider a\\n\\npedestrian for purposes of the No-Fault Act.\\n\\n      Goyco’s LSES is a “vehicle” that uses a rechargeable electric motor and\\n\\nis therefore “propelled by other than muscular power” and is “designed for use\\n\\non highways, rails and tracks.” The plain text and legislative history of\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 39:4-14.16 do not suggest that the Legislature intended LSES riders\\n\\nto be considered pedestrians for purposes of the No-Fault Act. By contrast, the\\n\\ntext of the No-Fault Act and its legislative history suggest that LSES riders are\\n\\nnot considered “pedestrians” for purposes of PIP benefits. As a result, and\\n\\nbecause there is no argument that the policy at issue here provides coverage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        22\\n beyond the statutory requirements, Goyco is not a pedestrian entitled to PIP\\n\\nbenefits under Progressive’s No-Fault insurance policy.\\n\\n                                      IV.\\n\\n      The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed as modified.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, PIERRE-LOUIS,\\nWAINER APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE SOLOMON’s\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      23\\n '),\n",

(A-47-22) (087887)\\n\\nArgued October 24, 2023 -- Decided April 22, 2024\\n\\nWAINER APTER, J., writing for the Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court considers the showing required to establish “the\\npossibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim” pursuant\\nto N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) in order to obtain a final protective order under the\\nSexual Assault Survivor Protection Act of 2015 (SASPA).\\n\\n       Plaintiff “Clara” testified that, in June 2018, she was sexually assaulted by\\ndefendant “Martin.” Clara applied for a temporary protective order (TPO), and then\\na final protective order (FPO), under SASPA. After hearing testimony, the trial\\ncourt made explicit findings under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1) and (2). The court found\\nthat (1) Clara had been “subjected to nonconsensual sexual contact within the\\nmeaning of SASPA” because her “extreme voluntary intoxication” made it\\nimpossible for her to consent to sexual contact; and (2) there was a possibility of\\nfuture risk to Clara’s safety or well-being because Martin had been subjected to\\nlegal fees defending against the SASPA FPO and “may now harbor a grudge against\\n[Clara] which would probably not have occurred but for these proceedings.” The\\ncourt therefore issued an FPO directing Martin to have no contact with Clara.\\n\\n       The Appellate Division reversed on the basis of the test the trial court had\\nused to assess consent under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1). 461 N.J. Super. 341, 350-51\\n(App. Div. 2019). The Court reversed, holding that “the affirmative consent\\nstandard . . . is the correct standard to be applied in determining whether sexual\\nactivity” was consensual under SASPA. 248 N.J. 428, 431, 445 (2021). The Court\\nnoted that the trial court on remand could expand upon its abbreviated discussion of\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). Id. at 448.\\n\\n       On remand, Clara testified that she continued, more than three years later, to\\nbe intensely traumatized by the sexual assault. Martin did not testify, electing to\\nrely on his testimony from the initial hearing. The court found Clara’s testimony\\nfrom the first and second hearings “credible and believable” and Martin’s testimony\\nfrom the first hearing “not credible” and “not truthful.” On the first factor, N.J.S.A.\\n2C:14-16(a)(1), the court therefore held that consent to sexual contact “was not\\n\\n                                           1\\n affirmatively and freely given.” Turning to N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), the court noted\\nthat “the statute only requires a possibility, as opposed to a probability.” The court\\nfound “a significant risk to [Clara’s] psychological well-being should this order not\\nremain in effect” and ordered the FPO previously issued to remain in effect.\\n\\n       The Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that “plaintiff satisfied her\\nburden of demonstrating a predicate act as defined under” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1)\\nand that “there exists a possibility of future risk to her safety or well-being as\\nrequired by” the ordinary terms of -16(a)(2). The Court granted certification limited\\nto the interpretation of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). 254 N.J. 183 (2023).\\n\\nHELD: The plain language of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) creates a standard that is\\npermissive and easily satisfied. Here, plaintiff testified that a sexual assault\\n“destroyed” her, she was intensely traumatized, and she was “terrified” for her\\nsafety. The family court found her testimony credible. Based on that testimony, the\\ncourt held plaintiff had demonstrated a “possibility of future risk” to her “safety or\\nwell-being.” The Court affirms.\\n\\n1. “Any person alleging to be a victim of nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual\\npenetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such conduct,” who is not eligible for a\\nrestraining order as a “victim of domestic violence” under the Prevention of\\nDomestic Violence Act of 1991 (PDVA) may apply for a protective order under\\nSASPA. N.J.S.A. 2C:14-14(a)(1), -16. The standard for granting a SASPA\\nprotective order differs depending on whether the applicant seeks a temporary or\\nfinal order. Importantly, an FPO does not require a showing that it is “necessary to\\nprotect the safety and well-being” of the victim like a TPO does, see N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n15(a); rather, an FPO requires only the “possibility of future risk to the safety or\\nwell-being of the alleged victim,” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). (pp. 14-18)\\n\\n2. The permissive standards for a SASPA TPO and a PDVA temporary restraining\\norder (TRO) are nearly identical, as are the procedures for seeking a PDVA final\\nrestraining order (FRO) and a SASPA FPO. Notably, both SASPA FPOs and PDVA\\nFROs require consideration of a list of non-exhaustive factors, but SASPA lists only\\ntwo such factors -- “(1) the occurrence of one or more acts of nonconsensual sexual\\ncontact, sexual penetration, or lewdness . . . ; and (2) the possibility of future risk to\\nthe safety or well-being of the alleged victim,” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a) -- whereas the\\nPDVA lists six, see N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a). The Legislature could have duplicated\\nthe second factor for a PDVA FRO -- “[t]he existence of immediate danger to person\\nor property,” N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a)(2) -- in SASPA, but it did not. In addition, the\\nconsequences to a defendant of a PDVA FRO are drastically different from the\\nconsequences to a respondent of a SASPA FPO. (pp. 18-22)\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            2\\n 3. Applying ordinary definitions of the terms used in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), the\\nstatute’s plain language requires a court to consider whether there is a chance that a\\nsurvivor may be exposed to physical danger, risk, or injury, or may be exposed to\\nsomething emotionally unwelcome or unpleasant that could make the survivor feel\\nuncomfortable, unhealthy, or unhappy. Because the language of factor two is\\ncentered on the safety or well-being of the victim-survivor, a survivor’s own\\ntestimony regarding possible future risks to their safety or emotional well-being can\\nsuffice. The Court’s reading of the plain text of factor two as creating a lenient and\\neasy-to-satisfy standard is reinforced by context: the “possibility of future risk”\\nrequired for a SASPA FPO is less demanding than the “necessary” protection\\nrequired for a SASPA TPO or the “immediate danger” required for a PDVA FRO.\\nApplying that standard, the Court defers to the trial court’s factual findings because\\nthey are supported by substantial evidence and finds no error in the court’s legal\\nconclusion. (pp. 22-26)\\n\\n4. The Court explains why it is not persuaded by Martin’s claims of error, why it\\ndisagrees with the concurrence’s view of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e) and (f), and why it\\ndeclines to adopt either the six PDVA factors or the standard established for PDVA\\nFROs for use in the SASPA context. Finally, the Court explains that its discussion\\nof Clara’s testimony is not intended to imply that such evidence of psychological\\nsymptoms or treatment is necessary to satisfy N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). (pp. 26-33)\\n\\n      AFFIRMED.\\n\\n      JUSTICE FASCIALE, concurring, disagrees that a SASPA FPO requires\\nvictims to speculate about the “possibility of future risk to [their] safety or well-\\nbeing.” In Justice Fasciale’s view, once a victim proves by a preponderance of the\\nevidence that a respondent committed a predicate act of “nonconsensual sexual\\ncontact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such conduct,” N.J.S.A.\\n2C:14-16(a)(1), the victim is automatically entitled to an FPO prohibiting the\\nrespondent from contacting the victim and committing further predicate acts, see\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e). Justice Fasciale regards the “possibility” of what may or may\\nnot happen in the future, see N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), as a factor to consider when\\nfashioning additional relief in the FPO under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f) rather than an\\nelement of proof that a victim must establish to obtain an FPO.\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE WAINER APTER’s opinion.\\nJUSTICE FASCIALE filed a concurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          3\\n        SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY\\n             A-47 September Term 2022\\n                       087887\\n\\n\\n                        C.R.,\\n\\n                Plaintiff-Respondent,\\n\\n                          v.\\n\\n                        M.T.,\\n\\n                Defendant-Appellant.\\n\\n        On certification to the Superior Court,\\n                  Appellate Division.\\n\\n       Argued                      Decided\\n   October 24, 2023              April 22, 2024\\n\\n\\nLeah A.

Those amendments went into effect on January 1,\\n2024. Because the amendments are not at issue in this case, this opinion relies\\nonly on the text of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-13 to -21 in effect prior to January 1, 2024.\\nAll citations to N.J.S.A. 2C:14-13 to -21 are to the pre-amendment language as\\nof December 31, 2023, and this opinion continues to refer to the law as\\nSASPA.\\n2\\n  Although the Sexual Assault Survivor Protection Act is survivor-centered,\\nthe text of the law uses the word “victim” or “alleged victim” and not the word\\n“survivor.” See N.J.S.A. 2C:14-13 to -21. When quoting the statute, we use\\n\\n                                        2\\n       We hold that the plain language of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) creates a\\n\\nstandard that is permissive and easily satisfied. Here, plaintiff testified that a\\n\\nsexual assault “destroyed” her, she was intensely traumatized, and she was\\n\\n“terrified” for her safety. The family court found her testimony credible.\\n\\nBased on that testimony, the court held plaintiff had demonstrated a\\n\\n“possibility of future risk” to her “safety or well-being.” We affirm.\\n\\n                                         I.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      We rely on the comprehensive discussion of the facts and procedural\\n\\nhistory set forth in our first opinion in this case, C.R. v. M.T. (C.R. I), 248 N.J.\\n\\n428 (2021). We add here only those details necessary to understand the\\n\\nquestion presented and events that occurred after our remand in C.R. I.\\n\\n      On the evening of June 26, 2018, Clara went out to two bars with her\\n\\nthen-best-friend Sylvia. 3 Clara testified that later that night, she was sexually\\n\\nassaulted by Martin, Sylvia’s cousin, on the floor of Martin’s garage. Martin\\n\\ntestified that the sexual penetration was consensual. Clara testified that it was\\n\\nnot. Martin never contacted or attempted to contact Clara after the incident.\\n\\n\\n\\nthe word “victim” or “alleged victim.” Otherwise, we use both “victim” and\\n“survivor.”\\n3\\n   We refer to the parties and witnesses by the same pseudonyms used in C.R.\\nI.\\n                                        3\\n       Clara applied for a temporary protective order (TPO), and then a final\\n\\nprotective order (FPO), under SASPA. After hearing testimony from Clara,\\n\\nMartin, and Sylvia, the trial court made explicit findings under N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(a)(1) and (2). 4 The court found that (1) Clara had been “subjected to\\n\\nnonconsensual sexual contact within the meaning of SASPA” because her\\n\\n“extreme voluntary intoxication” made it impossible for her to consent to\\n\\nsexual contact; and (2) there was a possibility of future risk to Clara’s safety or\\n\\nwell-being because Martin had been subjected to legal fees defending against\\n\\nthe SASPA FPO and “may now harbor a grudge against [Clara] which would\\n\\nprobably not have occurred but for these proceedings.” The court therefore\\n\\nissued an FPO directing Martin to have no contact with Clara.\\n\\n      Martin appealed. The Appellate Division reversed and remanded,\\n\\ndirecting the trial court to apply the “prostration of faculties” test to determine\\n\\nwhether Clara had been sufficiently intoxicated to be incapable of consenting\\n\\nto sexual activity under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1). C.R. v. M.T., 461 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 341, 350-51 (App. Div. 2019).\\n\\n      We granted Clara’s petition for certification, 241 N.J. 329 (2020), and\\n\\nreversed the Appellate Division’s decision, C.R. I, 248 N.J. at 431. Rather\\n\\n\\n4\\n  Throughout this litigation, the parties and courts referred to N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n16(a)(1) and (2) as the two required “prongs” of SASPA. We call the two\\nprovisions “factors,” which more precisely reflects the statute’s plain text.\\n                                         4\\n than the “prostration of faculties” test, we held that “the affirmative consent\\n\\nstandard articulated in” State in Interest of M.T.S., 129 N.J. 422 (1992), “is the\\n\\ncorrect standard to be applied in determining whether sexual activity” was\\n\\nconsensual under SASPA. C.R. I, 248 N.J. at 445. Under M.T.S., “any act of\\n\\nsexual penetration engaged in by the defendant without the affirmative and\\n\\nfreely-given permission of the victim to the specific act of penetration\\n\\nconstitutes the offense of sexual assault.” 129 N.J. at 444. We thus remanded\\n\\nto the trial court “for reconsideration of . . . whether the sexual activity was\\n\\nconsensual or nonconsensual” under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1), “utilizing the\\n\\nM.T.S. affirmative consent standard.” C.R. I, 248 N.J. at 447.\\n\\n      Although the Appellate Division in C.R. I had not addressed N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(a)(2), the possibility of future risk to Clara’s safety or well-being,\\n\\nsee 461 N.J. Super. 341, we discussed it briefly, noting that it would be\\n\\nrelevant to the trial court’s reconsideration of the FPO on remand. 248 N.J. at\\n\\n447-48. Recounting the trial court’s reasoning, discussed above, that Martin\\n\\nhad “through this process been subjected to legal fees and may now harbor a\\n\\ngrudge against [Clara] which would probably not have occurred but for these\\n\\nproceedings,” we stated:\\n\\n                   It cannot be that simply filing for a protective\\n            order is sufficient to create “the possibility of future\\n            risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim”\\n            noted in prong two. If that were so, prong two would\\n                                         5\\n             be met in every single SASPA case. That could not\\n            have been the Legislature’s intention.\\n\\n                   Here, the factual findings that the trial court put\\n            on the record appear to counter [Clara]’s establishing\\n            prong two of SASPA, and the trial court relied on the\\n            simple fact that [Clara] had sought a restraining order\\n            to conclude that “it is more likely than not that a final\\n            restraining order is appropriate” in this case. We\\n            remand so that the trial court may expand upon its\\n            abbreviated discussion of prong two and make\\n            additional findings of fact that support a determination\\n            either that the prong has been satisfied, or not, in\\n            deciding whether to issue the final restraining order.\\n\\n            [Id. at 448.]\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      On remand before a different judge, Clara testified that she continued,\\n\\nmore than three years later, to be intensely traumatized by the sexual assault.\\n\\n            Q. So since this time and after this event occurred [in\\n            2018], how has been your well-being? How have you\\n            dealt with this issue?\\n\\n            A. I am affected by what happened every day. I’ve\\n            seen multiple therapists and I lay in bed at night and I\\n            can’t sleep because I still feel like I’m in the garage\\n            sometimes.\\n\\n            I have terrible intimacy issues. I can’t date because I\\n            don’t trust anyone. I don’t -- I have a hard time making\\n            friends because I don’t trust my friends anymore. I --\\n            it destroyed me, honestly.\\n\\n            Like, I’ve lost my sense of self-worth.               I lost\\n            everything. I feel like -- some days, I feel like I’ll never\\n            not be in that garage, honestly. Like, I wonder how I\\n                                         6\\n             can ever not be traumatized by this and I don’t think\\n            that’s a possibility.\\n\\n            Q. Besides the well-being that you’ve just explained,\\n            if this were (inaudible -- recording issue), do you fear\\n            for your safety and the possibility of harm from this\\n            Defendant?\\n\\n            A. I do. I really, I do. I think the only reason I have\\n            any sort of peace of mind is because I know I have this\\n            temporary right now and I’m so terrified that if I didn’t\\n            have it, he would be angry that I’ve spent three years\\n            just asking for this.\\n\\n            Just asking for a sense of security. I think he would\\n            definitely harass me for challenging it. I feel like every\\n            time -- I can’t even begin to explain the, like, terror that\\n            I feel every day when I am unsure of my surroundings.\\n\\n            I can’t even -- I have a hard time even going shopping\\n            by myself because what if something happens? How\\n            will I defend myself? And if there’s no protective\\n            order, then he has no consequences.\\n\\nMartin did not testify, electing to rely on his testimony from the initial hearing.\\n\\n      The court found Clara’s testimony from the first and second hearings\\n\\n“credible and believable” and Martin’s testimony from the first hearing “not\\n\\ncredible” and “not truthful.” On the first factor, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1), the\\n\\ncourt therefore held that consent to sexual contact “was not affirmatively and\\n\\nfreely given.”\\n\\n      Turning to N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), the court noted that “the statute only\\n\\nrequires a possibility, as opposed to a probability, of future risk to the safety or\\n\\n                                         7\\n well-being of the alleged Victim. The plain meaning of the word ‘possible’\\n\\nsubsumes the notion that an event may or may not occur.” Acknowledging\\n\\nthat Martin had not attempted to contact Clara in the more than three years\\n\\nsince the incident, the court found that did “not foreclose the possibility of risk\\n\\nto [Clara’s] safety or her well-being.”\\n\\n      The court detailed Clara’s testimony, set forth above, about the long-\\n\\nterm effects of the incident, including that Clara had seen multiple therapists,\\n\\nhad difficulty sleeping, had intimacy issues, and suffered ongoing\\n\\nconsequences that were “real and traumatizing.” Without an FPO, the court\\n\\nconcluded that any progress Clara had “made in therapy could be eviscerated.”\\n\\nFinding “a significant risk to [Clara’s] psychological well-being should this\\n\\norder not remain in effect,” the court held that Clara had satisfied N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(a)(2). 5 It therefore ordered the FPO previously issued by the initial\\n\\ntrial court judge to remain in effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  The first trial judge explicitly stated that “plaintiff is tasked in this case with\\nproving both elements of SASPA,” N.J.S.A.2C:14-16(a)(1) and (2), “by a\\npreponderance of the evidence,” and made factual findings as to each. The\\nremand judge likewise explicitly held that a survivor must prove “by a\\npreponderance of the evidence . . . that there is the possibility of future risk to\\n[her] safety or well-being,” and that this “prong” was satisfied.\\n                                          8\\n                                          C.\\n\\n      Martin appealed, arguing that Clara satisfied neither N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n\\n16(a)(1) or (2) because the sexual activity was consensual, he posed no threat\\n\\nto Clara, and her fear of him was “irrational.”\\n\\n      In an unpublished opinion, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial\\n\\ncourt, concluding that “plaintiff satisfied her burden of demonstrating a\\n\\npredicate act as defined under the first prong of SASPA[] and [that] there\\n\\nexists a possibility of future risk to her safety or well-being as required by the\\n\\nAct’s second prong.” On the first factor, the appellate court noted the\\n\\nsubstantial deference owed to the Family Part’s findings of fact “[b]ecause of\\n\\nits special expertise in family matters,” and held that the court’s conclusion on\\n\\nthe lack of consent was “supported by adequate, substantial, credible\\n\\nevidence.” (quoting Cesare v. Cesare, 154 N.J. 394, 412 (1998)).\\n\\n      Turning to the second factor, the court focused on the plain and ordinary\\n\\nmeaning of the terms in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). Because the statute does not\\n\\ndefine the words used in (a)(2), the Appellate Division relied on Merriam-\\n\\nWebster’s Dictionary, observing that risk is defined as “possibility of loss or\\n\\ninjury”; safety as “the condition of being safe from . . . hurt, injury, or loss”;\\n\\nand well-being as “the state of being happy, healthy, or prosperous.” The\\n\\nappellate court concluded that in light of those definitions, and “in view of the\\n\\n                                         9\\n trial judge’s credibility and factual findings, we are satisfied plaintiff\\n\\ndemonstrated the possibility of the future risk of harm to her well-being or\\n\\nsafety.”\\n\\n      We granted Martin’s petition for certification limited to the\\n\\ninterpretation of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). 254 N.J. 183 (2023). We also\\n\\ngranted leave to Legal Services of New Jersey (LSNJ) and Partners for Women\\n\\nand Justice (Partners) to participate as amici curiae.\\n\\n                                         II.\\n\\n      Martin submits that the trial court’s interpretation of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n\\n16(a)(2) on remand, which the Appellate Division affirmed, sets the bar too\\n\\nlow because “unless one or the other party is dead, there is always a\\n\\npossibility, however miniscule, of future risk.” That runs afoul of our holding\\n\\nin C.R. I, Martin maintains, because it means that “prong two would be met in\\n\\nevery single SASPA case.” Moreover, according to Martin, “[a]n irrational\\n\\nfear does not warrant a restraining order,” and “merely wanting a restraining\\n\\norder for ‘peace of mind’” does not “meet the requirements of prong two.”\\n\\nBecause there was “absolutely no evidence placed on the record” that he posed\\n\\n“any threat” to Clara or anyone else, and because the parties have had no\\n\\ncontact since the incident, Martin urges, “the Appellate Division erred as a\\n\\nmatter of law in . . . render[ing] prong two meaningless.”\\n\\n                                         10\\n       Clara counters that the courts below correctly construed the statute’s\\n\\n“plain, unambiguous language.” According to Clara, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n\\n16(a)(2)’s “requirement” that “alleged victims . . . show the possibility of\\n\\nfuture risk to their ‘safety or well-being’” in order to obtain an FPO “is\\n\\nsatisfied by exactly the type of serious psychological trauma” that the trial\\n\\ncourt found she “compellingly demonstrated in this case.” Martin, Clara\\n\\nargues, asks the Court to ignore the plain language of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2)\\n\\nand “apply the much more stringent test [for a Final Restraining Order (FRO)]\\n\\nunder [the] Prevention of Domestic Violence Act [PDVA], N.J.S.A. 2C:25-17\\n\\nto -35.” Yet when the Legislature enacted SASPA in 2015, Clara maintains, it\\n\\nintentionally chose not to incorporate the more rigorous requirements of the\\n\\nPDVA, and it is “not a court’s ‘function to re-write a plainly written\\n\\nenactment.’” (quoting J.H. v. R&M Tagliareni, LLC, 239 N.J. 198, 214\\n\\n(2019)). Clara also submits that SASPA’s “broad and compelling remedial\\n\\npurposes” are fully consistent with interpreting N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) to be\\n\\nsatisfied by “future risk to the psychological well-being of sexual assault\\n\\nsurvivors.”\\n\\n      Amicus Partners for Women and Justice asserts that while “the Court\\n\\nmay be concerned that in some cases a liberal standard will make the issuance\\n\\nof [a SASPA FPO] perfunctory, it is what the Legislature intended.” Partners\\n\\n                                       11\\n urges us to apply the “perfunctory and self-evident” standard established for\\n\\nPDVA FROs by the Appellate Division in A.M.C. v. P.B., 447 N.J. Super.\\n\\n402, 417 (App. Div. 2016), to SASPA FPOs as well, and thus hold that\\n\\nSASPA’s second factor is automatically satisfied whenever the predicate act is\\n\\n“nonconsensual sexual penetration (i.e., rape) or other egregious acts of sexual\\n\\nviolence.” Partners also emphasizes that a SASPA FPO carries consequences\\n\\nfor a respondent that are less significant than a PDVA FRO.\\n\\n      Amicus LSNJ submits that the Legislature “molded SASPA to the\\n\\ncontours of the PDVA” in certain ways, and the “hand-in-glove connections\\n\\nbetween the two statutes makes for a sharp contrast where the Legislature\\n\\nincorporated dissimilar language and standards into SASPA.” Focusing on\\n\\none such distinction, LSNJ contrasts a PDVA FRO, which requires that relief\\n\\nbe “necessary to prevent further abuse,” with SASPA’s consideration of “the\\n\\npossibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim.”\\n\\nLSNJ argues this “must be viewed as [a] deliberate choice[] by the Legislature\\n\\nthat represent[s] the intent to achieve distinct standards.” LSNJ also\\n\\nencourages us to establish a list of factors that courts should consider in\\n\\ndetermining whether N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) is satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        12\\n                                          III.\\n\\n                                         A.\\n\\n      We defer to a trial court’s factual findings “when supported by adequate,\\n\\nsubstantial, credible evidence.” Cesare, 154 N.J. at 411-12 (1998). “That\\n\\ndeference is especially appropriate ‘when the evidence is largely testimonial\\n\\nand involves questions of credibility.’” MacKinnon v. MacKinnon, 191 N.J.\\n\\n240, 254 (2007) (quoting Cesare, 154 N.J. at 412). We will therefore leave a\\n\\ntrial court’s factual findings undisturbed “unless they ‘went so wide of the\\n\\nmark that a mistake must have been made.’” Ibid. (quoting DYFS v. M.M.,\\n\\n189 N.J. 261, 279 (2007)).\\n\\n      We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo, owing no\\n\\ndeference to the legal conclusions of the trial court or the Appellate Division.\\n\\nState v. Fuqua, 234 N.J. 583, 591 (2018).\\n\\n      In cases of statutory interpretation, we start with “the statutory\\n\\nlanguage.” DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005). “We ascribe to the\\n\\nstatutory words their ordinary meaning and significance and read them in\\n\\ncontext with related provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a\\n\\nwhole.” Ibid. (citation omitted). “[W]hen the language of a statute is clear on\\n\\nits face,” our “sole function . . . is to enforce it according to its terms.”\\n\\nCashin v. Bello, 223 N.J. 328, 335 (2015) (alteration in original) (quoting\\n\\n                                         13\\n Hubbard v. Reed, 168 N.J. 387, 392 (2001)). We “may neither rewrite a\\n\\nplainly-written enactment of the Legislature nor presume that the Legislature\\n\\nintended something other than that expressed by way of the plain language.”\\n\\nIbid.

State, 171 N.J. 484, 488 (2002)).\\n\\n      In construing a statute’s plain language, we “strive[] for an interpretation\\n\\nthat gives effect to all of the statutory provisions and does not render any\\n\\nlanguage inoperative, superfluous, void[,] or insignificant.’” In re\\n\\nDiGuglielmo, 252 N.J. 350, 360 (2022) (second alteration in original) (quoting\\n\\nSanchez v. Fitness Factory Edgewater, LLC, 242 N.J. 252, 261 (2020)).\\n\\nMoreover, “[w]hen ‘the Legislature has carefully employed a term in one place\\n\\nand excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.’” Higgins\\n\\nv. Pascack Valley Hosp., 158 N.J. 404, 419 (1999) (quoting GE Solid State,\\n\\nInc. v. Dir., Div. of Tax’n, 132 N.J. 298, 307-08 (1993)).\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      As we detailed in C.R. I, SASPA, which was enacted in 2015, allows\\n\\nsurvivors of sexual assault who cannot seek restraining orders under the\\n\\nPrevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 (PDVA), N.J.S.A. 2C:25-17\\n\\nto -35, to seek temporary and permanent civil protective orders. 248 N.J. at\\n\\n441. Specifically, “[a]ny person alleging to be a victim of nonconsensual\\n\\nsexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such\\n\\n                                       14\\n conduct,” who is not eligible for a restraining order as a “victim of domestic\\n\\nviolence” under the PDVA, may apply for a protective order under SASPA.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-14(a)(1), -16.\\n\\n      The PDVA defines “victim of domestic violence” as a person “who has\\n\\nbeen subjected to domestic violence” by a spouse, former spouse, household\\n\\nmember, a person with whom the victim has or will have a child, or a person\\n\\nwith whom the victim had a dating relationship. N.J.S.A. 2C:25-19(d). A\\n\\nperson who is “subjected to sexual violence in a random encounter” or by\\n\\nsomeone with whom they have “less than a dating relationship” therefore\\n\\ncannot seek a restraining order under the PDVA -- “SASPA was intended to\\n\\nfill this void.” R.L.U. v. J.P., 457 N.J. Super. 129, 135 (App. Div. 2018).\\n\\n      The standard for granting a SASPA protective order differs depending\\n\\non whether the applicant seeks a temporary or final order.\\n\\n      TPOs may be granted on an emergency and ex parte basis “when\\n\\nnecessary to protect the safety and well-being of an alleged victim on whose\\n\\nbehalf the relief is sought.” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a). In addition, a court “shall”\\n\\ngrant a TPO if it “determines that the applicant is a victim of nonconsensual\\n\\nsexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such\\n\\nconduct, and qualifies for such relief” under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-14. See N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-15(b). A TPO, which “shall be granted upon good cause shown,” id. at\\n\\n                                       15\\n (d), may include “any relief necessary to protect the safety and well-being of\\n\\nan alleged victim,” id. at (a). Examples of possible forms of relief include an\\n\\norder prohibiting the respondent from having any contact with the victim or\\n\\nthe victim’s family members, and an order prohibiting the respondent from\\n\\nentering the victim’s home, school, or work. Id. at (e)(1) to (6).\\n\\n      The standard for granting an FPO, by contrast, is a preponderance of the\\n\\nevidence. Importantly, an FPO does not require a showing that it is “necessary\\n\\nto protect the safety and well-being” of the victim; it requires only the\\n\\n“possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim.”\\n\\nThe statute sets forth the procedure and requirements for obtaining an FPO in\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a):\\n\\n            A hearing [for an FPO] shall be held in the Superior\\n            Court within 10 days of the filing of an application [for\\n            a TPO] . . . . At the hearing, the standard for proving\\n            the allegations made in the application for a protective\\n            order shall be a preponderance of the evidence. The\\n            court shall consider but not be limited to the following\\n            factors:\\n\\n                (1) the occurrence of one or more acts of\\n                nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or\\n                lewdness, or any attempt at such conduct, against the\\n                alleged victim; and\\n\\n                (2) the possibility of future risk to the safety or\\n                well-being of the alleged victim.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a) (emphasis added).]\\n\\n                                        16\\n Although the statute defines the terms “sexual contact,” “sexual penetration,”\\n\\nand “lewdness” used in factor one, see N.J.S.A. 2C:14-14(a)(1), it does not\\n\\ndefine any of the words included in factor two.\\n\\n      The remainder of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16 sets forth additional instructions for\\n\\nFPOs. For example, a court may not deny an FPO due to the “alleged victim’s\\n\\nfailure to report the incident to law enforcement; the alleged victim’s or the\\n\\nrespondent’s alleged intoxication; whether the alleged victim did or did not\\n\\nleave the premises to avoid [the] nonconsensual sexual contact . . . ; or the\\n\\nabsence of signs of physical injury to the alleged victim.” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n\\n16(b). And “evidence of the alleged victim’s previous sexual conduct or\\n\\nmanner of dress at the time of the incident shall not be admitted” in any FPO\\n\\nproceeding. N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(c).\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e) then sets forth a necessary precondition for the\\n\\nissuance of an FPO and what such an order must prohibit.\\n\\n            A final protective order issued pursuant to this section\\n            shall be issued only after a finding or an admission is\\n            made that the respondent committed an act of\\n            nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or\\n            lewdness, or any attempt at such conduct, against the\\n            alleged victim. A final protective order shall:\\n\\n               (1) prohibit the respondent from having contact\\n               with the victim; and\\n\\n               (2) prohibit the respondent from committing any\\n               future act of nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual\\n                                       17\\n                 penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such\\n                conduct, against the victim.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e).]\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f) lists additional relief, identical to restrictions that can be\\n\\nimposed on a respondent as part of a TPO under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(e)(2) to\\n\\n(6), that an FPO may include.\\n\\n      Finally, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(i), either party can file a petition\\n\\nwith the court “to dissolve or modify a final protective order.” In adjudicating\\n\\nthe petition, the court must “consider whether a material change in\\n\\ncircumstances has occurred” that would render the continuance of the FPO\\n\\n“inequitable, oppressive or unjust taking into account . . . the desire of the\\n\\nvictim for the continuation of the protective order, the potential for contact\\n\\nbetween the parties, the history of the respondent’s violations of the protective\\n\\norder or criminal convictions, and any other factors that the court may find\\n\\nrelevant.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      As earlier noted, SASPA explicitly allows orders of protection only for\\n\\nthose who are “not eligible for a restraining order as a ‘victim of domestic\\n\\nviolence’” under the PDVA. N.J.S.A. 2C:14-14(a)(1). As a complement to\\n\\nthe PDVA, SASPA mirrors the PDVA in certain respects, and diverges from it\\n\\nin others. Both bear mention here.\\n                                        18\\n       Like SASPA, the PDVA allows survivors to “seek emergency, ex parte\\n\\nrelief.” N.J.S.A. 2C:25-28(f). Under SASPA, that relief is a TPO; under the\\n\\nPDVA, it is a temporary restraining order (TRO). See N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a);\\n\\n2C:25-28(f). The permissive standards for a SASPA TPO and a PDVA TRO\\n\\nare nearly identical: a judge may issue a PDVA TRO “when necessary to\\n\\nprotect the life, health or well-being of a victim,” N.J.S.A. 2C:25-28(f),\\n\\nwhereas a SASPA TPO may be issued “when necessary to protect the safety\\n\\nand well-being of an alleged victim,” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a).\\n\\n      The procedures for seeking a PDVA final restraining order (FRO) and a\\n\\nSASPA FPO are also the same. Both require that a hearing be held within ten\\n\\ndays of the filing of the application for a TRO or TPO. See N.J.S.A. 2C:25-\\n\\n29(a); N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a). Both provide that at the hearing, the standard for\\n\\nproving the allegations in the complaint or application shall be a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence. See ibid. And both provide that “[t]he court\\n\\nshall consider but not be limited to the following factors.” Ibid. (emphasis\\n\\nadded).\\n\\n      However, SASPA then lists only two factors that the court shall\\n\\nconsider: “(1) the occurrence of one or more acts of nonconsensual sexual\\n\\ncontact, sexual penetration, or lewdness . . . ; and (2) the possibility of future\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        19\\n risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim.” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)\\n\\n(emphasis added). The PDVA, in contrast, lists six:\\n\\n            (1) The previous history of domestic violence between\\n            the plaintiff and defendant, including threats,\\n            harassment and physical abuse;\\n\\n            (2) The existence of immediate danger to person or\\n            property;\\n\\n            (3) The financial circumstances of the plaintiff and\\n            defendant;\\n\\n            (4) The best interests of the victim and any child;\\n\\n            (5) In determining custody and parenting time the\\n            protection of the victim’s safety; and\\n\\n            (6) The existence of a verifiable order of protection\\n            from another jurisdiction.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a) (emphasis added).]\\n\\n      Four of the six PDVA factors could not have applied to SASPA because\\n\\na SASPA FPO is available only to a person who did not have a close prior\\n\\nrelationship with the alleged perpetrator. However, the second factor for a\\n\\nPDVA FRO does not speak to a prior relationship between the parties, and the\\n\\nLegislature therefore could have duplicated it in SASPA. It did not. Instead,\\n\\nthe Legislature prescribed SASPA’s second factor, instructing a court to\\n\\nconsider “the possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        20\\n victim,” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), rather than “[t]he existence of immediate\\n\\ndanger to person or property,” N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a)(2).\\n\\n      In addition, the consequences to a defendant of a PDVA FRO are\\n\\ndrastically different from the consequences to a respondent of a SASPA FPO.\\n\\nRecall that a SASPA FPO must only “(1) prohibit the respondent from having\\n\\ncontact with the victim; and (2) prohibit the respondent from committing any\\n\\nfuture act of nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness . . .\\n\\nagainst the victim.” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e). And it may include additional\\n\\nrelief barring the respondent from entering the victim’s home, school, or work.\\n\\nSee id. at (f)(1) to (5).\\n\\n      Penalties in a PDVA FRO, on the other hand, can be far more severe. A\\n\\ndefendant must “immediate[ly] surrender . . . any firearm,” and an FRO must\\n\\nprohibit the defendant from purchasing, owning, or possessing any weapons.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(b). An FRO can then include nineteen additional forms of\\n\\nrelief, including an order: granting exclusive possession to a plaintiff of a\\n\\nhome the plaintiff and defendant had shared, while requiring the defendant to\\n\\ncontinue making payments on the home; directing the defendant to pay money\\n\\ndamages to the plaintiff, including the cost of counseling, moving expenses,\\n\\nattorney’s fees, damages for pain and suffering, and punitive damages;\\n\\ngranting the plaintiff “temporary possession of specified personal property,”\\n\\n                                       21\\n such as a car; “awarding temporary custody of a minor child” to the plaintiff;\\n\\nrequiring the defendant “to receive professional domestic violence\\n\\ncounseling”; and requiring the defendant “to undergo a psychiatric\\n\\nevaluation.” Id. at (b)(1) to (19).\\n\\n                                        IV.\\n\\n      SASPA’s plain language and context lead us to conclude that Clara’s\\n\\ntestimony on remand was sufficient for the trial court to find the statute\\n\\nsatisfied, and order the FPO to remain in effect. We therefore affirm the\\n\\njudgment of the Appellate Division.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      On its face, the text of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), requiring a court to\\n\\nconsider “the possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged\\n\\nvictim,” creates a permissive standard that is easily satisfied.\\n\\n      Because SASPA does not define the words “possibility,” “risk,”\\n\\n“safety,” or “well-being,” we afford the terms their “generally accepted\\n\\nmeaning, according to the approved usage of the language.” See N.J.S.A. 1:1-\\n\\n1. Like the Appellate Division, we turn to dictionary definitions for guidance.\\n\\n      The New Oxford American Dictionary defines “possibility” as “a thing\\n\\nthat may happen or be the case.” New Oxford American Dictionary 1365 (3d\\n\\ned. 2010). The word “possibility” therefore does not require that something\\n\\n                                        22\\n will definitely happen, will probably happen, or even will likely happen; it\\n\\nsimply requires a chance that something “may happen or be the case.” “Risk”\\n\\nis defined as “a situation involving exposure to danger” or “the possibility that\\n\\nsomething unpleasant or unwelcome will happen.” Id. at 1507. “Safety” is\\n\\n“the condition of being protected from or unlikely to cause danger, risk, or\\n\\ninjury.” Id. at 1537. And “well-being” is a “state of being comfortable,\\n\\nhealthy, or happy.” Id. at 1961.\\n\\n      The plain language of factor two thus requires a court to consider\\n\\nwhether there is a chance that a survivor may be exposed to physical danger,\\n\\nrisk, or injury, or may be exposed to something emotionally unwelcome or\\n\\nunpleasant that could make them feel uncomfortable, unhealthy, or unhappy.\\n\\nAnd because the language of factor two is centered on the safety or well-being\\n\\nof the victim-survivor, a survivor’s own testimony regarding possible future\\n\\nrisks to their safety or emotional well-being can suffice.\\n\\n      Our reading of the plain text of factor two as creating a lenient and easy-\\n\\nto-satisfy standard is reinforced by context -- the ways in which the\\n\\nLegislature intentionally distinguished a SASPA FPO from both a SASPA\\n\\nTPO and a PDVA FRO.\\n\\n      As earlier noted, a SASPA TPO may be granted “when necessary to\\n\\nprotect the safety and well-being of an alleged victim on whose behalf the\\n\\n                                       23\\n relief is sought,” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a) (emphasis added). The Legislature\\n\\ncould have used the same language for a SASPA FPO as well, requiring that it\\n\\nbe “necessary to protect” a victim. It did not. Instead, an FPO requires\\n\\nconsideration only of the “possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being\\n\\nof the alleged victim.” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) (emphasis added). A\\n\\n“possibility of future risk” is less demanding than “necessary” protection. We\\n\\nmust respect that legislative choice. See State v. Ferguson, 238 N.J. 78, 102\\n\\n(2019) (“Different words used in the same, or a similar, statute are assigned\\n\\ndifferent meanings whenever possible.” (quoting In re Expungement Petition\\n\\nof J.S., 223 N.J. 54, 74 n.5 (2015))).\\n\\n      Similarly, in crafting SASPA, the Legislature intentionally copied much\\n\\nof the language of the PDVA, including the opening sentences of N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(a). See supra at ___ (slip op. at 18-19); N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a). But\\n\\nthe PDVA’s second factor requires courts to consider “the existence of\\n\\nimmediate danger to person or property,” N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a)(2), whereas\\n\\nSASPA’s second factor requires consideration only of “the possibility of future\\n\\nrisk to the safety or well-being” of the victim, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a).\\n\\n      While a “possibility” is something that may occur in the future, in order\\n\\nto “exist[],” something must be presently occurring. And a “future risk” to a\\n\\nperson’s “safety or well-being,” is of course far less demanding than an\\n\\n                                         24\\n “immediate danger” to that person. Rather than importing the PDVA’s second\\n\\nfactor, the Legislature thus used far broader language in SASPA. Especially\\n\\nbecause the statutes are identical in so many other respects, those differences\\n\\nmust be treated as deliberate. See State v. Ryan, 249 N.J. 581, 599 (2022) (“It\\n\\nis the Legislature’s prerogative to impose a requirement in one context but not\\n\\nanother; it is our duty to treat that distinction as meaningful.”).\\n\\n      We must respect the Legislature’s decision to create a standard for a\\n\\nSASPA FPO that is broad and permissive, both on its face and as compared\\n\\nwith a SASPA TPO and a PDVA FRO.\\n\\n                                         B.\\n\\n      Applying this analysis, we defer to the trial court’s factual findings\\n\\nbecause they are supported by substantial evidence, and we find no error in the\\n\\ncourt’s legal conclusion.\\n\\n      Clara testified that she is “affected by what happened every day.” She\\n\\nexplained that she has seen multiple therapists, cannot sleep, has a hard time\\n\\nmaking friends or trusting people, and has “terrible intimacy issues.” She told\\n\\nthe court that she feared for her safety, felt terrified each time she was unsure\\n\\nof her surroundings, and had a hard time going shopping on her own. She\\n\\ndetailed how she had lost her “sense of self-worth,” and how the sexual assault\\n\\nhad “destroyed [her,] honestly.”\\n\\n                                        25\\n          The remand judge found her testimony “credible and believable.” The\\n\\njudge concluded that there was a “possibility of future risk” to Clara’s “safety\\n\\nor well-being” if the FPO put in place by the original trial judge were to be\\n\\ndissolved or modified. He therefore ordered the FPO to remain in effect.\\n\\n         We are not persuaded by Martin’s claims of error. Martin first argues\\n\\nthat requiring only a “possibility of future risk” to a victim’s safety or well-\\n\\nbeing runs afoul of our analysis in C.R. I, because “unless one or the other\\n\\nparty is dead, there is always a possibility, however miniscule, of future risk”\\n\\nand factor two would thus be met “in every single SASPA case.”\\n\\n         Martin misconstrues our statement in C.R. I that “[i]t cannot be that\\n\\nsimply filing for a protective order is sufficient to create ‘the possibility of\\n\\nfuture risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim,’” or “prong two\\n\\nwould be met in every single SASPA case.” 248 N.J. at 448. That means only\\n\\nthat the procedural step of requesting an FPO cannot, in and of itself, satisfy\\n\\none of the two substantive factors that are considered to obtain an FPO. It\\n\\ndoes not mean that negative consequences of sexual assault, such as trauma,\\n\\nanxiety, or fear, can be ignored simply because they may exist in many SASPA\\n\\ncases.\\n\\n         “Our courts have recognized that, in sexual assault cases, ‘the wellbeing\\n\\nof . . . victims demands heightened protection’ because there is a ‘likelihood of\\n\\n                                         26\\n emotional trauma and mental distress.’” State v. Chambers, 252 N.J. 561, 584\\n\\n(2023) (omission in original) (quoting State v. D.R.H., 127 N.J. 249, 259\\n\\n(1992)). C.R. I does not require courts to ignore the precise forms of trauma\\n\\nthat victims of sexual assault are most likely to experience when analyzing\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). On the contrary, the plain language of the provision\\n\\nmakes clear that credible testimony about such emotional and psychological\\n\\nharm can be sufficient to satisfy SASPA’s second factor.\\n\\n      Martin also contends that “[a]n irrational fear does not warrant a\\n\\nrestraining order,” and that Clara’s fears are unreasonable because he has not\\n\\nattempted to contact her in the three years since the incident. But nothing in\\n\\nthe plain language of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) requires a survivor’s belief\\n\\nabout the possibility of future risk to their safety or well-being to be\\n\\nobjectively reasonable.\\n\\n      The Legislature is familiar with a reasonable person standard, and has\\n\\nchosen to employ it in many other statutes. 6 Not so here. The word\\n\\n\\n6\\n  See, e.g., N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(b) (“A person is guilty of stalking . . . if he\\npurposefully or knowingly engages in a course of conduct directed at a specific\\nperson that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his safety . . . .”);\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:21-25(a) (“A person is guilty of a crime if the person . . .\\ntransports or possesses property known or which a reasonable person would\\nbelieve to be derived from criminal activity. . . .”); N.J.S.A. 2C:14-9(a) (“An\\nactor commits a crime of the fourth degree if, knowing that he is not licensed\\nor privileged to do so, and under circumstances in which a reasonable person\\n\\n                                        27\\n “reasonable” does not appear in SASPA, and we “decline [respondent’s]\\n\\ninvitation to read into [the law] a requirement that a [survivor’s] fear of\\n\\nencountering the [respondent] must be objectively reasonable under the\\n\\ncircumstances.” K.N.B. v. M.D., 259 A.3d 341, 351 (Pa. 2021). As the\\n\\nPennsylvania Supreme Court held regarding Pennsylvania’s Protection of\\n\\nVictims of Sexual Violence or Intimidation Act, “there is simply no textual\\n\\nsupport for the conclusion that a . . . plaintiff’s fear of harm must be analyzed\\n\\nusing an objective, reasonable-person standard.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      The concurring opinion disagrees with this reading of the statute, and\\n\\nwould hold that “[o]nce a victim proves by a preponderance of the evidence\\n\\nthat a respondent committed a predicate act of nonconsensual sexual contact,\\n\\nsexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such conduct . . . the victim\\n\\nis automatically entitled to an FPO” under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e).

According to the\\n\\nconcurrence, “the possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the\\n\\nalleged victim” under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) is not relevant to whether a\\n\\n\\n\\nwould know that another may expose intimate parts or may engage in sexual\\npenetration or sexual conduct, he observes another person without that\\nperson’s consent and under circumstances in which a reasonable person would\\nnot expect to be observed.”).\\n                                      28\\n survivor can obtain an FPO under -16(a); it is only “one factor to consider\\n\\nwhen fashioning additional relief in the FPO under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f).”\\n\\nPost at ___ (slip op. at 2).\\n\\n      No party or amicus has so argued before this Court, the trial court, or the\\n\\nAppellate Division. Perhaps that is because the argument contravenes the\\n\\nplain language of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a), (e), and (f).\\n\\n      Had the Legislature wanted to prescribe that an FPO must automatically\\n\\nissue anytime a judge finds, or a respondent admits to, a predicate act, it could\\n\\nhave said so in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a). It also could have deleted large portions\\n\\nof N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a), moved N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e) up to the first provision,\\n\\nand written it as: “A final protective order shall be issued after a finding or an\\n\\nadmission is made that the respondent committed an act of nonconsensual\\n\\nsexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such\\n\\nconduct, against the alleged victim.”\\n\\n      It did not. The words “a final protective order issued pursuant to this\\n\\nsection,” rather than “pursuant to this subsection,” in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e),\\n\\nmost naturally refer back to N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a), which sets forth, in detail,\\n\\nthe who, what, when, where, why, and how of an FPO. And the words “shall\\n\\nbe issued only after a finding or admission is made” in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        29\\n indicate that while the finding or admission of a predicate act is a necessary\\n\\ncondition to the issuance of an FPO, it is not itself sufficient.\\n\\n      Similarly, had the Legislature wanted to mandate that a trial court\\n\\nconsider “the possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged\\n\\nvictim,” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), only “when fashioning additional relief in\\n\\nthe FPO under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f),” post at ___ (slip op. at 2), it could have\\n\\ndone so.\\n\\n      Again, it did not. Simply put, there is no textual connection between\\n\\nsatisfying N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) and the imposition of additional relief\\n\\nunder N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f). N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) does not mention\\n\\nsubsection (f) and says nothing about additional forms of relief that an FPO\\n\\ncan include. Likewise, subsection (f) does not reference N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n\\n16(a)(2) or mention “the possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of\\n\\nthe alleged victim.” And subsection (f) explicitly allows for all its listed forms\\n\\nof relief to be applied in any FPO, not merely where a court finds “the\\n\\npossibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim.”\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), (f).\\n\\n      The concurrence asserts that its interpretation is compelled by “[a] full\\n\\nreading of SASPA’s text.” Post at ___ (slip op. at 12). But the concurrence\\n\\nactually gives short shrift to the words in N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a) to (d), reads the\\n\\n                                        30\\n word “only” out of subsection (e), and reads the words “the possibility of\\n\\nfuture risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim” into subsection (f).\\n\\nWe decline to adopt that approach.\\n\\n      We also decline LSNJ’s invitation to adopt a list of factors for courts to\\n\\nconsider in determining whether a survivor has shown “the possibility of\\n\\nfuture risk to the[ir] safety or well-being” under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). Had\\n\\nthe Legislature wanted to import into SASPA the six factors listed in the\\n\\nPDVA, N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a)(1) to (6), it could have done so. Similarly,\\n\\nalthough the Legislature set forth four factors for a court to consider in\\n\\ndetermining whether a SASPA FPO should be dissolved or modified under\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(i), including “the potential for contact between the parties”\\n\\nand “the history of the respondent’s violations of the protective order or\\n\\ncriminal convictions,” it did not include any of those factors in the list of what\\n\\na court “shall” consider in deciding whether to issue an FPO to begin with,\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a). We therefore do not add those factors, or any others the\\n\\nLegislature did not include, to N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). See, e.g., DiProspero,\\n\\n183 N.J. at 492 (“We cannot ‘write in an additional qualification which the\\n\\nLegislature pointedly omitted in drafting its own enactment . . . .’” (quoting\\n\\nCraster v. Bd. of Comm’rs of Newark, 9 N.J. 225, 230 (1952))).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        31\\n       We likewise do not reach Partners’ request, echoed by LSNJ, to apply\\n\\nthe “perfunctory and self-evident” standard established for PDVA FROs by the\\n\\nAppellate Division in A.M.C. v. P.B., 447 N.J. Super. at 417, to SASPA FPOs,\\n\\nand to therefore hold that SASPA’s second factor is automatically satisfied\\n\\nwhenever the predicate act is “nonconsensual sexual penetration (i.e., rape) or\\n\\nother egregious acts of sexual violence.” Clara did not include such a request\\n\\nin her briefing to this Court or any court. “[A]s a general rule, the Court ‘does\\n\\nnot consider arguments that have not been asserted by a party, and are raised\\n\\nfor the first time by an amicus curiae.’” State in Int. of A.A., 240 N.J. 341,\\n\\n359 n.1 (2020) (quoting State v. J.R., 227 N.J. 393, 421 (2017)). And the issue\\n\\nraised by Partners is not necessary to decide this case, as Clara clearly put\\n\\nforth sufficient evidence to show a “possibility of future risk” to her “safety or\\n\\nwell-being” under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2).\\n\\n      We make one final comment. Because three years elapsed between the\\n\\nissuance of the initial FPO and the second FPO hearing, Clara was able to\\n\\nprovide testimony during the remand hearing about mental health treatment\\n\\nshe had been receiving and how the sexual assault was still impacting her life\\n\\nseveral years later. The concurrence expresses concern that the unique\\n\\nprocedural posture of this case, in which Clara was able to testify with “the\\n\\nbenefit of hindsight,” “illustrates how N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2)’s standard will\\n\\n                                        32\\n not always be ‘easily satisfied.’” Post at ___ (slip op. at 27). We disagree.\\n\\nOur discussion of Clara’s testimony, see supra at ___ (slip op. at 6-7, 25), is\\n\\nnot intended to imply that such evidence of psychological symptoms or\\n\\ntreatment is necessary to satisfy N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). Indeed, because an\\n\\nFPO hearing is generally required to take place within ten days of the filing of\\n\\nan application for a SASPA TPO, see N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), a survivor will\\n\\nlikely not yet have received any mental health treatment. Expert testimony or\\n\\ndocumentation of psychological treatment is therefore not required.

Murphy signed legislation amending SASPA\\nto broaden its protective scope for victims of alleged sexual contact and other\\npredicate acts. See Office of the Governor, Press Release: Governor Murphy\\nSigns Legislation Expanding Access to Temporary Protective Orders (July 24,\\n2023), https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562023/approved/20230724c.s\\nhtml. The amendment became effective January 1, 2024. Just like SASPA,\\nVASPA “[a]uthorizes issuance of protective orders for certain victimized\\npersons in situations for which domestic violence statutes do not apply due to\\nlack of familial or dating relationship between victim and offending actor.” S.\\n1517 Synopsis (Second Reprint, Feb. 10, 2022). It also adds two predicate\\nacts -- stalking and cyber-harassment -- and expressly defines “emotional\\n of SASPA requires no such conjecture. Once a victim proves by a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence that a respondent committed a predicate act of\\n\\n“nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt\\n\\nat such conduct,” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1), the victim is automatically entitled\\n\\nto an FPO prohibiting the respondent from contacting the victim and\\n\\ncommitting further predicate acts, see N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e). The “possibility”\\n\\nof what may or may not happen in the future -- even if “permissive and easily\\n\\nsatisfied,” ante at ___ (slip op. at 3) -- is simply one factor to consider when\\n\\nfashioning additional relief in the FPO under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f). It is not an\\n\\nelement of proof that a victim must establish to obtain an FPO.\\n\\n      This is a unique case because the victim here testified at two FPO\\n\\nhearings that were over three years apart and before different FPO judges.\\n\\nTwo FPO hearings occurred because there was a remand.

Pertinent to this case, VASPA did not change the burden of proof a\\nvictim must surmount to obtain final protection but indeed expanded\\nprotections for victims who could not get relief previously under the\\nPrevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 (PDVA), N.J.S.A. 2C:25-17\\nto -35. Given that VASPA did not change any provision relevant to the\\nissuance of an FPO, my interpretation of SASPA applies in full force to\\nVASPA. And because the VASPA amendments are not at issue in this case, as\\nthe majority stated, this opinion too relies on the text of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-13 to -\\n21 in effect prior to January 1, 2024. All citations to N.J.S.A. 2C:14-13 to -21\\nare to the pre-amendment language as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n                                        2\\n (C.R. I), 248 N.J. 428 (2021). At the first FPO hearing in 2018, approximately\\n\\none month after the occurrence of the predicate act, the initial FPO judge\\n\\nfound that there existed “the possibility of future risk to the safety or well-\\n\\nbeing of the alleged victim,” id. at 436, despite citing no evidence. The judge\\n\\ninstead relied only on the filing for a protective order to make that finding.\\n\\nIbid. That is why the Court in C.R. I stated that “[i]t cannot be that simply\\n\\nfiling for a protective order is sufficient to create ‘the possibility of future risk\\n\\nto the safety or well-being of the alleged victim’ noted in [factor] two.” Id. at\\n\\n448 (quoting N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2)). 2\\n\\n      Instead of concluding that there existed sufficient evidence in the record\\n\\nto support a finding that there is a “possibility of future risk to the safety or\\n\\nwell-being of the alleged victim,” the Court in C.R. I correctly determined that\\n\\nthe “factual findings that the [initial FPO judge] put on the record appear to\\n\\ncounter plaintiff’s establishing” that there is a “possibility of future risk to the\\n\\nsafety or well-being of the alleged victim.” Ibid. (emphasis added).

Ante at ___ (slip op. at 4 n.4). But I disagree that\\nthe second factor -- N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) -- needs to be proven by a victim\\nas an element before the issuance of the FPO. Consideration of factor two is\\nnot an element of proof to obtain the FPO; instead, it is relevant to fashioning\\nadditional protection under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f).\\n                                        3\\n fact [on factor two] that support a determination either that the [factor] has\\n\\nbeen satisfied, or not, in deciding whether to issue the final [protective] order.”\\n\\nIbid. (emphasis added). Although the majority here determined that “the plain\\n\\nlanguage of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) creates a standard that is permissive and\\n\\neasily satisfied,” ante at ___ (slip op. at 3), the first FPO judge’s inability to\\n\\npoint to such evidence belies that determination and prompted, in part, C.R. I’s\\n\\nremand instructions.\\n\\n      On remand, a different judge, over three years later, heard additional\\n\\ntestimony from the victim, who instead of speculating about the “possibility of\\n\\nfuture risk to [her] safety or well-being,” testified specifically about how the\\n\\npredicate act, which occurred over three years prior, impacted her. After\\n\\nhearing this new testimony, the second judge decided to keep the original FPO\\n\\nin effect, which included additional protections under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f).\\n\\n      That procedure is highly uncommon. As I will later explain, this\\n\\nirregularity underscores two critical points: (1) victims will likely struggle to\\n\\nproduce evidence shortly after a predicate act occurs that demonstrates there\\n\\nexists a “possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged\\n\\nvictim,” and (2) final protection under SASPA is not dependent on speculation\\n\\nthat there exists a “possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the\\n\\nalleged victim.”\\n\\n                                          4\\n       I would thus hold that the victim here is entitled to the FPO solely\\n\\nbecause she proved at the first FPO hearing the occurrence of a predicate act\\n\\nunder N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1). No other proof was required for her to obtain\\n\\nthe minimum protection available under SASPA and mandated by N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(e). Furthermore, it is equally clear to me that the victim -- who\\n\\namplified her testimony three-plus years later at a remand hearing -- is entitled\\n\\nto additional relief under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f), not based on the initial FPO\\n\\nrecord, but rather, on the subsequent findings made by the remand judge that\\n\\nshe suffered a “possibility of future risk to [her] safety or well-being” under\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2). 3\\n\\n      I therefore write separately.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  This Court reviews the interpretation of statutes de novo. Ante at ___ (slip\\nop. at 13) (quoting State v. Fuqua, 234 N.J. 583, 591 (2018)). In doing so, the\\nCourt’s role is to discern and effectuate the Legislature’s intent which first\\ninvolves analyzing the plain text of the statute, and then resorting to extrinsic\\nsources if the text is ambiguous. State v. S.B., 230 N.J. 62, 67-68 (2017);\\nDiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005); see also Young v.

Christie signed SASPA into law\\n\\neffective May 7, 2016. Unlike the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of\\n\\n1991 (PDVA), N.J.S.A. 2C:25-17 to -35, which protects victims of domestic\\n\\nviolence, SASPA protects “[a]ny person alleging to be a victim of\\n\\nnonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt\\n\\nat such conduct, and who is not eligible for a restraining order as a ‘victim of\\n\\ndomestic violence’ as defined by the” PDVA. N.J.S.A. 2C:14-14(a)(1)\\n\\n(emphases added). 4 SASPA allows those who are not protected under the\\n\\nPDVA to “file an application with the Superior Court . . . alleging the\\n\\ncommission of such conduct or attempted conduct and seeking a temporary\\n\\nprotective order [(TPO)].” Ibid.\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n      Preliminarily, I briefly discuss the PDVA and SASPA given the natural\\n\\ntendency to compare the elements of proof for the issuance of a PDVA final\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  The PDVA defines a “[v]ictim of domestic violence” as “any person who is\\n18 years of age or older or who is an emancipated minor and who has been\\nsubjected to domestic violence by a spouse, former spouse,” household\\nmember, someone with whom “the victim has had a dating relationship,” or\\n“any person, regardless of age, who has been subjected to domestic violence\\nby a person with whom the victim has a child in common” or plans to have a\\nchild and “one of the parties is pregnant.” N.J.S.A. 2C:25-19(d).\\n\\n                                        6\\n restraining order (FRO) with that of an FPO under SASPA. As the majority\\n\\ncorrectly points out, “SASPA mirrors the PDVA in certain respects, and\\n\\ndiverges from it in others.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 18). FROs under the\\n\\nPDVA and FPOs under SASPA (1) protect victims against prescribed predicate\\n\\nacts; (2) require alleged victims to establish by a preponderance of the\\n\\nevidence the occurrence of one or more predicate acts; and (3) require the FRO\\n\\nor FPO judge to “consider” certain “factors.” However, other than those\\n\\ngeneral similarities, the PDVA and SASPA are incomparable.\\n\\n      Under the PDVA, and unlike SASPA, the Legislature “did not intend that\\n\\nthe commission of one of the enumerated predicate acts of domestic violence\\n\\n[would] automatically mandate[] the entry of a domestic violence restraining\\n\\norder.” Silver v. Silver, 387 N.J. Super. 112, 126-27 (App. Div. 2006)\\n\\n(emphases added). The text of SASPA is different. It states that an “[FPO]\\n\\nissued pursuant to this section shall be issued only after a finding or an\\n\\nadmission is made that the respondent committed” a predicate act. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(e) (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Importantly, an FRO under the PDVA is aimed at providing prospective\\n\\nrelief against predicted future acts of harm; it is geared towards ending the\\n\\ncycle of domestic violence. See N.J.S.A. 2C:25-18 (explaining that, when it\\n\\nenacted the PDVA, the Legislature intended “to assure the victims of domestic\\n\\n                                        7\\n violence the maximum protection from abuse the law can provide”). That is\\n\\nprecisely why, in the context of the PDVA, FRO judges must determine\\n\\nwhether an FRO is “necessary to prevent further abuse.” See N.J.S.A. 2C:25-\\n\\n29(b) (emphases added). Thus, to obtain an FRO under the PDVA, a victim\\n\\nmust not only prove that a predicate act occurred but also that an FRO is\\n\\n“necessary . . . to protect the victim from an immediate danger or to prevent\\n\\nfurther abuse.” Silver, 387 N.J. Super. at 127.\\n\\n      In contrast, a SASPA victim need not prove a “second prong” or “factor”\\n\\nas a prerequisite to obtaining an FPO. Under SASPA, contrary to the\\n\\nmajority’s view, the issuance of an FPO does not require a victim to also\\n\\ndemonstrate, beyond proving the commission of a predicate act, that without\\n\\nan FPO there exists a “possibility of future risk to the [victim’s] safety or well-\\n\\nbeing.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 3, 22). And SASPA definitely does not require\\n\\na victim to show that the FPO is “necessary . . . to protect the victim from an\\n\\nimmediate danger or to prevent further abuse.” Silver, 387 N.J. Super. at 127.\\n\\nRather, SASPA provides that an alleged victim is automatically entitled to an\\n\\nFPO after establishing only that a respondent committed one or more predicate\\n\\nacts. See N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e). Therefore, the elements of proof, the\\n\\nanalytical framework, and the overall structure of SASPA and the PDVA\\n\\ndiffer, and cannot be conflated.\\n\\n                                         8\\n                                         A.\\n\\n      Notably, an FPO under SASPA is accomplished in two different\\n\\nsequential stages: first is the initial TPO stage which has a “good cause”\\n\\nburden of proof, and then second is the FPO stage which has a heavier burden\\n\\nof proof “by a preponderance of the evidence.” Although our focus here is on\\n\\nthe proofs necessary at the second stage (obtaining an FPO), I dissect each\\n\\nstage not only to inform litigants and superior court judges about the\\n\\nsignificant differences, but also to emphasize that consideration of the\\n\\n“possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim,”\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), is to be considered to fashion additional relief in the\\n\\nFPO, not as a required element of proof for an FPO.\\n\\n                                        1.\\n\\n      At the first stage, an alleged victim of a predicate act under SASPA must\\n\\napply for an emergency ex parte TPO. N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15. N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n\\n15(d) provides that a TPO “shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall\\n\\nremain in effect until a judge of the Superior Court issues a further order.”\\n\\n(emphasis added). At this TPO stage, unlike at the FPO stage, the immediate\\n\\nfocus is the emergent nature prompted by the alleged predicate act and the\\n\\nneed to protect the victim pending a final hearing. See N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        9\\n And unlike in the context of an FPO, there are two different grounds that a\\n\\nsuperior court judge can rely on to issue a TPO.\\n\\n      The first available ground on which to grant a TPO is discretionary. See\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a). N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a) provides that\\n\\n            [a] judge of the Superior Court may enter an emergency\\n            ex parte order when necessary to protect the safety and\\n            well-being of an alleged victim on whose behalf the\\n            relief is sought. The court may grant any relief\\n            necessary to protect the safety and well-being of an\\n            alleged victim.\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\nUnder that ground, a judge may issue a TPO and “grant any relief necessary to\\n\\nprotect the safety and well-being of an alleged victim.” Ibid.\\n\\n      In contrast, the second available ground to grant a TPO is mandatory.\\n\\nSee N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(b). N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(b) provides that\\n\\n            [t]he court shall, upon consideration of the application,\\n            order emergency ex parte relief in the nature of a [TPO]\\n            if the court determines that the applicant is a victim of\\n            nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or\\n            lewdness, or any attempt at such conduct, and qualifies\\n            for such relief pursuant to [N.J.S.A. 2C:14-14].\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\nUnder that ground, a judge must issue a TPO if that judge determines that the\\n\\napplicant is indeed a victim of a predicate act under SASPA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       10\\n       After deciding that a TPO is warranted, the judge may turn to N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-15(e) which sets forth a non-exhaustive list of initial available\\n\\nemergency protections that a TPO judge may impose, pending a final hearing,\\n\\nto protect the safety and well-being of the alleged victim.\\n\\n      After an emergency ex parte TPO has been issued on either of the two\\n\\nabovementioned grounds, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a) or (b), and after the TPO judge\\n\\nhas fashioned any appropriate temporary emergency relief pending an FPO\\n\\nhearing, stage two quickly occurs. An FPO hearing then “shall be held in the\\n\\nSuperior Court within 10 days of the filing of” a TPO application. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(a).\\n\\n                                       2.\\n\\n      At the second stage, i.e., the FPO stage, an alleged victim must prove by\\n\\na preponderance of the evidence (compared to the TPO stage’s easier “good\\n\\ncause” standard) the “allegations made in the application for a protective\\n\\norder.” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a). Applications for protective orders pertain to\\n\\nfacts supporting the victim’s allegation that a respondent committed one of the\\n\\npredicate acts under SASPA. See N.J.S.A. 2C:14-14(a)(1) (defining the\\n\\npredicate acts).\\n\\n      In general, as in all bench trials, an FPO judge will consider a multitude\\n\\nof factors when conducting the final hearing, such as credibility of the\\n\\n                                       11\\n witnesses, physical evidence, and so on. Without limiting an FPO judge’s\\n\\nability to weigh the relevant evidence at the final hearing, SASPA identifies\\n\\nonly two non-exhaustive “factors” that an FPO judge must “consider.”\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1) and (2) explain that\\n\\n            [t]he court shall consider but not be limited to the\\n            following factors:\\n\\n                   (1) the occurrence of one or more acts of\\n                   nonconsensual      sexual      contact,   sexual\\n                   penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such\\n                   conduct, against the alleged victim; and\\n\\n                   (2) the possibility of future risk to the safety or\\n                   well-being of the alleged victim.\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\nA full reading of SASPA’s text requires an FPO judge to “consider” each factor\\n\\nfor different reasons: factor one deals with the predicate act and relates to the\\n\\nrelief that must be issued under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e); factor two concerns\\n\\npossible future risk to the victim’s safety or well-being and relates to N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(f)’s permissive additional relief.\\n\\n      As to the first mandatory factor, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(1) requires an\\n\\nFPO judge to “consider” “the occurrence of one or more acts of nonconsensual\\n\\nsexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such\\n\\nconduct, against the alleged victim.” The parties and amici agree that an FPO\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        12\\n cannot be issued unless the judge finds, or an admission is made, that a\\n\\nrespondent committed at least one predicate act enumerated under SASPA.\\n\\n      That finding controls. In comparison to the initial TPO stage where a\\n\\nTPO judge has the authority to issue a TPO on two different grounds -- one\\n\\ndiscretionary “when necessary to protect the safety and well-being of an\\n\\nalleged victim,” N.J.S.A. 2C:14-15(a), and one mandatory when “the court\\n\\ndetermines that the applicant is a victim” of a predicate act, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n\\n15(b) -- the Legislature emphasized that an FPO judge shall rely on only one\\n\\nground at the final hearing. See N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e). N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e)\\n\\nprovides that an FPO\\n\\n            shall be issued only after a finding or an admission is\\n            made that the respondent committed [a predicate] act of\\n            nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or\\n            lewdness, or any attempt at such conduct, against the\\n            alleged victim.\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\nAnd unlike what is required to obtain an FRO under the PDVA -- that both a\\n\\npredicate act occurred and the FRO is necessary to prevent further abuse --\\n\\nonce an FPO judge in a SASPA case finds that a respondent committed one of\\n\\nthe predicate acts, or there is such an admission, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e) requires\\n\\nthat the FPO “shall be issued” and shall automatically:\\n\\n            (1) prohibit the respondent from having contact with\\n            the victim; and\\n                                       13\\n              (2) prohibit the respondent from committing any future\\n             act of nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual\\n             penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt at such\\n             conduct, against the victim.\\n\\nNo speculation is required about what may or may not happen in the future.\\n\\nThe FPO must be issued.\\n\\n      As to the second factor, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2) requires that an FPO\\n\\njudge also “consider” “the possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being\\n\\nof the alleged victim.” SASPA does not define the words “consider,”\\n\\n“possibility,” “future,” “risk,” “safety,” or “well-being.” I agree with the\\n\\nmajority that we must afford those terms their “generally accepted meaning.”\\n\\nAnte at ___ (slip op. at 22) (quoting N.J.S.A. 1:1-1). To “consider” means to\\n\\n“think carefully about (something), typically before making a decision[;] . . .\\n\\n[to] take (something) into account when making an assessment or judgment.”\\n\\nNew Oxford American Dictionary 370 (3d ed. 2010). Under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-\\n\\n16(e), an FPO “shall be issued only after a finding or an admission is made\\n\\nthat the respondent committed” a predicate act. If the Legislature intended that\\n\\nan FPO be issued only after the FPO judge finds that a predicate act occurred\\n\\nplus an additional finding that there exists a “possibility of future risk to the\\n\\n[victim’s] safety or well-being,” it would have said so. See DiProspero, 183\\n\\nN.J. at 492 (“We cannot ‘write in an additional qualification which the\\n\\n                                        14\\n Legislature pointedly omitted in drafting its own enactment . . . .’” (quoting\\n\\nCraster v. Bd. of Comm’rs of Newark, 9 N.J. 225, 230 (1952))). No such\\n\\nlanguage is included in SASPA.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      Why then did the Legislature require FPO judges to, among other\\n\\n“factors,” “consider” the “possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being\\n\\nof the alleged victim”? It is my view that under SASPA, an FPO judge “shall\\n\\nconsider” the “possibility” of such “future risk,” and any other relevant\\n\\nevidence, when fashioning enhanced relief authorized by N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f).\\n\\nMy view is supported by the text of SASPA, the definition of “consider,” and\\n\\nhow the Legislature used the word “consider” in the PDVA.\\n\\n      N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f) provides:\\n\\n            In addition to any relief provided to the victim under\\n            [N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e), an FPO] issued pursuant to this\\n            section may include, but is not limited to, the following\\n            relief:\\n\\n                   (1) an order prohibiting the respondent from\\n                   entering the residence, property, school, or place\\n                   of employment of the victim or the victim’s\\n                   family or household members, and requiring the\\n                   respondent to stay away from any specified place\\n                   that is named in the order and is frequented\\n                   regularly by the victim or the victim’s family or\\n                   household members;\\n\\n                   (2) an order prohibiting the respondent from\\n                   having any contact with the victim or others,\\n                                        15\\n                   including an order forbidding the respondent\\n                  from personally or through an agent initiating any\\n                  communication likely to cause annoyance or\\n                  alarm including, but not limited to, personal,\\n                  written, or telephone contact, or contact via\\n                  electronic device, with the victim or the victim’s\\n                  family members or their employers, employees,\\n                  or fellow workers; an employee or volunteer of a\\n                  sexual assault response entity that is providing\\n                  services to a victim; or others with whom\\n                  communication would be likely to cause\\n                  annoyance or alarm to the victim;\\n\\n                  (3) an order prohibiting the respondent from\\n                  stalking or following, or threatening to harm,\\n                  stalk or follow, the victim;\\n\\n                  (4) an order prohibiting the respondent from\\n                  committing or attempting to commit an act of\\n                  harassment, including an act of cyber-\\n                  harassment, against the victim; and\\n\\n                  (5) any other relief that the court deems\\n                  appropriate.\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\nThose added protections provide more relief to the victim beyond the\\n\\nautomatic protection issued after a finding is made that a predicate act\\n\\noccurred -- i.e., prohibiting a respondent from contacting the victim, N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(e)(1), and from committing further prohibited acts, id. at (e)(2). An\\n\\nFPO judge has broad discretion to grant additional protections based on all the\\n\\nevidence introduced at the hearing, whether premised on the nature and facts\\n\\n\\n                                       16\\n of the predicate act, a “future risk to [a victim’s] safety or well-being,” or any\\n\\nother consideration under the facts of each case.\\n\\n       Reference to considering “factors” is not new when it comes to\\n\\nprotective and restraining orders. As I pointed out, the PDVA requires FRO\\n\\njudges to “consider” “factors.” In the PDVA context, like here, consideration\\n\\nof enumerated “factors” is also for different purposes.\\n\\n       Specifically, under the PDVA, the Legislature directed that FRO judges\\n\\n“shall consider but not be limited to [six] factors.” N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a)(1) to\\n\\n(6). 5 To obtain an FRO under the PDVA, a victim need not establish each\\n\\n\\n5\\n    These non-exhaustive factors are:\\n\\n             (1) The previous history of domestic violence between\\n             the plaintiff and defendant, including threats,\\n             harassment and physical abuse;\\n\\n             (2) The existence of immediate danger to person or\\n             property;\\n\\n             (3) The financial circumstances of the plaintiff and\\n             defendant;\\n\\n             (4) The best interests of the victim and any child;\\n\\n             (5) In determining custody and parenting time the\\n             protection of the victim’s safety; and\\n\\n             (6) The existence of a verifiable order of protection\\n             from another jurisdiction.\\n\\n             [N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(a)(1) to (6).]\\n                                       17\\n numbered factor. Rather, when determining whether a victim has proven a\\n\\npredicate act under the PDVA, FRO judges consider primarily two of those six\\n\\nfactors, see Silver, 387 N.J. Super. at 126 (explaining that the FRO judge\\n\\n“must consider the evidence in light of whether there is a previous history of\\n\\ndomestic violence [(factor one)], and whether there exists immediate danger to\\n\\nperson or property [(factor two)]”). And when determining whether the “relief\\n\\n[is] necessary to prevent further abuse,” N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(b), which is an\\n\\nadditional element that is not expressly required under SASPA, FRO judges\\n\\nconsider all six factors, see Silver, 387 N.J. Super. at 127.\\n\\n      Thus, as illustrated by the definition of “consider,” and its use in both\\n\\nthe PDVA and SASPA, the language in SASPA that “[t]he court shall consider\\n\\nbut not be limited to the following factors,” on its own, does not expressly set\\n\\nforth the grounds for issuance of an FPO. Rather, it merely sets forth\\n\\ncircumstances the judge should “think carefully about” or “take . . . into\\n\\naccount” when fashioning additional relief in the order. See New Oxford\\n\\nAmerican Dictionary at 370.\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n      Although the text is clear, the legislative history and New Jersey’s\\n\\nexisting public policy also support my reading of SASPA. In enacting SASPA,\\n\\nthe Legislature focused on victims of nonconsensual sexual predicate acts.\\n\\n                                        18\\n New Jersey has increased protections for sexual assault victims. See State v.\\n\\nChambers, 252 N.J. 561, 583-86 (2023) (“Our courts have recognized that, in\\n\\nsexual assault cases, ‘the wellbeing of . . . victims demands heightened\\n\\nprotection’ because there is a ‘likelihood of emotional trauma and mental\\n\\ndistress.’” (omission in original) (quoting State v. D.R.H., 127 N.J. 249, 259\\n\\n(1992))). SASPA further provides for that enhanced protection.\\n\\n      In line with those goals, SASPA “help[s] better respond” to sexual\\n\\nassault victims. A. Judiciary Comm. Meeting on Sexual Assault Survivor\\n\\nProtection Act of 2015, A. 4078 (Jan. 15, 2015) (statement of Valerie Vainieri\\n\\nHuttle), https://njleg.state.nj.us/archived-media/2014/AJU-meeting-list/media-\\n\\nplayer?committee=AJU&agendaDate= 2015-01-15-\\n\\n10:00:00&agendaType=M&av=A. According to Assemblywoman Valerie\\n\\nHuttle, SASPA’s lead sponsor, “a critical issue [is] helping victims become\\n\\nsurvivors and helping them heal” and therefore SASPA is designed to help\\n\\naccomplish those goals and ensure that survivors feel safe. Ibid. Accordingly,\\n\\nSASPA imposes a “minimal burden and confusion for the courts.” Ibid. Given\\n\\nthis legislative history, it is of no surprise that to obtain an FPO, a victim need\\n\\nonly prove that a predicate act occurred, not that at some time in the future the\\n\\nvictim might experience the “possibility of future risk to [their] safety or well-\\n\\nbeing.” Any other reading -- even if the standard is “permissive and easily\\n\\n                                        19\\n satisfied,” ante at ___ (slip op. at 3) -- would contravene the Legislature’s\\n\\nintent and impose more “burden[s]” and “confusion” on the courts and\\n\\nlitigants.\\n\\n       Moreover, the legislative history surrounding VASPA emphasizes\\n\\nVASPA’s focus on protecting victims and ensuring straightforward access to\\n\\nlegal remedies. Assemblywoman Michele Matsikoudis commented about the\\n\\n2023 amendments that “[t]he law is now on the side of victims seeking\\n\\nprotection through the courts. Victims who have been targeted by strangers,\\n\\nneighbors and acquaintances will finally be able to experience the peace of\\n\\nmind that protective orders provide.” Office of the Governor, Press Release:\\n\\nGovernor Murphy Signs Legislation Expanding Access to Temporary\\n\\nProtective Orders (July 24, 2023) (emphasis added). Elaborating on the\\n\\nbenefits of VASPA’s protections, Senator Linda Greenstein stated that “[t]his\\n\\nlaw will empower victims to take legal action and obtain a [protective] order,\\n\\nproviding them with a crucial tool to proactively protect themselves before a\\n\\nstalking situation escalates.” Ibid.\\n\\n       Consistent with SASPA’s and VASPA’s purpose and New Jersey’s public\\n\\npolicy to protect victims of sexual violence, academic research also supports\\n\\nthe need to provide accessible legal remedies in the form of protective orders\\n\\nfor victims. Studies show that victims of sexual assault perceive orders of\\n\\n                                        20\\n protection as effective and crucial to their safety. See Jane K. Stoever,\\n\\nEnjoining Abuse: The Case for Indefinite Domestic Violence Protection\\n\\nOrders, 67 Vand. L. Rev. 1015, 1066 (2014). For instance, “obtaining a\\n\\nprotection order is deeply empowering because it entails asserting one’s own\\n\\nneeds, standing up to the abuser, and enlisting a potent institutional ally.”\\n\\nSally F. Goldfarb, Reconceiving Civil Protection Orders for Domestic\\n\\nViolence: Can Law Help End the Abuse Without Ending the Relationship?, 29\\n\\nCardozo L.

Fields, Debunking\\n\\nthe Stranger-in-the-Bushes Myth: The Case for Sexual Assault Protection\\n\\nOrders, 2017 Wis. L.

Trial & App. Advoc. 102, 111\\n\\n(2012)).\\n\\n                                        IV.\\n\\n      Application of those legal principles to the facts of this case is\\n\\nstraightforward, although with one caveat: unlike a typical SASPA case, in\\n\\nwhich an FPO judge conducts one hearing and the record on appeal pertains to\\n\\n                                        21\\n that hearing, here the victim testified at two FPO hearings before different\\n\\nFPO judges over three years apart from each other. The predicate act occurred\\n\\non June 26 into June 27, 2018. On July 2, 2018, the victim filed for and\\n\\nreceived a TPO under SASPA. Thereafter, as previously explained, the first\\n\\nFPO judge conducted a final hearing on August 2, 2018. The second FPO\\n\\njudge, i.e., the remand judge, conducted a second final hearing on November\\n\\n8, 2021.\\n\\n      At the first FPO hearing, the victim did not testify about the “possibility\\n\\nof future risk to [her] safety or well-being,” besides her one statement\\n\\nexplaining that she filed for an ex parte TPO because she “[did not] feel safe\\n\\nwithout it.” The victim was not questioned about “future risk” nor did she\\n\\nproduce evidence that would satisfy the test proffered by the majority today --\\n\\n“whether there is a chance that a [victim] may be exposed to physical danger,\\n\\nrisk, or injury, or may be exposed to something emotionally unwelcome or\\n\\nunpleasant that could make [her] feel uncomfortable, unhealthy, or unhappy.”\\n\\nAnte at ___ (slip op. at 23). And based on the testimony that was provided, the\\n\\nfirst FPO judge found it was clear that respondent did not call, text, contact, or\\n\\ninteract with the victim after the predicate act occurred. Thus, at the first FPO\\n\\nhearing, there was no showing that the victim may, in the future, be “exposed\\n\\nto physical danger, risk, or injury,” or “exposed to something emotionally\\n\\n                                        22\\n unwelcome or unpleasant that could make [her] feel uncomfortable, unhealthy,\\n\\nor unhappy.” See ibid.\\n\\n      As this Court stated in C.R. I, the “factual findings [at the first FPO\\n\\nhearing] appear to counter [the victim’s] establishing [the second factor] of\\n\\nSASPA.” 248 N.J. at 448. There were no facts identified by the judge to find\\n\\nthat there existed a “possibility of future risk to the safety or well-being of the\\n\\nalleged victim”; instead, the facts appeared contrary to such a finding. Ibid. If\\n\\nthe victim had presented evidence to show that there is a “possibility of future\\n\\nrisk to [her] safety or well-being,” there would have been no reason to remand\\n\\nthe case on this issue. 6 Instead, in its remand instructions, the Court instructed\\n\\nthe trial court to “make additional findings of fact that support a determination\\n\\n\\n6\\n  Similarly, even if the first FPO judge did not make a finding on factor two of\\nSASPA, had the record contained evidence that factor two was satisfied, the\\nC.R. I. Court would not have needed to remand for additional findings of fact\\non this factor. See A.M.C. v. P.B., 447 N.J. Super. 402, 418, 422 (App. Div.\\n2016) (reversing without a remand the trial judge’s decision not to issue an\\nFRO under the PDVA because the record supported issuance of the FRO); J.D.\\nv. A.M.W., 475 N.J. Super. 306, 315 (App. Div. 2023) (reversing the decision\\nnot to issue an FRO under the PDVA and remanding for entry of the FRO\\nbecause the record contained “ample evidence” that the plaintiff needed the\\nFRO to prevent further abuse); cf. J.S. v. D.S., 448 N.J. Super. 17, 23-24 (App.\\nDiv. 2016) (vacating an FRO under the PDVA and remanding the matter for a\\ndetermination of whether the predicate act of domestic violence occurred\\nbecause courts “have an obligation to ensure the FRO was legitimately\\nentered” and nothing in the record supported keeping the FRO in effect).\\nAlthough these are PDVA cases, the principle that an appellate court can\\nreverse without remanding and issue an FRO if supported by credible evidence\\nin the record, applies in equal force to SASPA FPOs.\\n                                         23\\n either that the [second factor] has been satisfied, or not, in deciding whether to\\n\\nissue the [FPO].” C.R. I, 248 N.J. at 448.\\n\\n      The first FPO judge in fact appropriately entered the FPO after finding\\n\\nthe victim “ha[d] been subjected to nonconsensual sexual activity.” Adhering\\n\\nto N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e)(1) and (2), the judge prohibited respondent from\\n\\nhaving “contact with the victim,” and from committing further acts of\\n\\n“nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, or any attempt\\n\\nat such conduct, against the victim.” It was error, however, for the first FPO\\n\\njudge to find there existed a “possibility of future risk to the [victim’s] safety\\n\\nor well-being” only because respondent has “been subjected to legal fees and\\n\\nmay now harbor a grudge against [the victim] which would probably not have\\n\\noccurred but for these proceedings.” Exercising discretion under N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(f)(3) and (4), he prohibited respondent from “stalk[ing],\\n\\nfollow[ing][,] or harass[ing] the victim.” 7 But as the Court stated in C.R. I,\\n\\n“[i]t cannot be that simply filing for a protective order is sufficient” to satisfy\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2), the “possibility of future risk to the safety or well-\\n\\nbeing of the alleged victim.” 248 N.J. at 448. A finding based on N.J.S.A.\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n  The record is unclear about whether the first FPO judge included further\\nprotection in accordance with N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f)(1) (barring respondent\\nfrom specific locations) and N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f)(2) (prohibiting respondent\\nfrom specific types of contact).\\n                                       24\\n 2C:14-16(a)(2) must be grounded in credible evidence since it allows a judge\\n\\nto enter further protections in the FPO.\\n\\n      Thus, I would hold that at the FPO stage, the “possibility of future risk\\n\\nto the safety or well-being of [an] alleged victim” exists if (1) in the future, (2)\\n\\nthe alleged victim may face either (a) a risk to safety -- physical injury, loss, or\\n\\ndamage, or (b) a risk to their well-being -- injury to the state of being happy or\\n\\nhealthy. And that finding then impacts the judge’s discretion to impose\\n\\nadditional relief in the FPO under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(f).\\n\\n      The victim here had the rare opportunity to testify again at a second FPO\\n\\nhearing. Instead of having to speculate about the “possibility of future risk to\\n\\n[her] safety or well-being,” she testified about how the incident affected her\\n\\nthree years and three months later, an opportunity -- as the majority correctly\\n\\npoints out -- that is typically unavailable for SASPA victims. Ante at ___ (slip\\n\\nop. at 32-33). Her testimony the second time around crystalized the impact of\\n\\nthe incident.\\n\\n      Looking back on the occurrence of the predicate act, the victim\\n\\nexplained how she: (1) will always be “traumatized” by what happened; (2)\\n\\nhas “terrible intimacy issues” and “can’t date”; and (3) has trouble sleeping\\n\\nand making friends due to her trust issues. As to her “well-being” she\\n\\nelaborated:\\n\\n                                        25\\n             I am affected by what happened every day. I’ve seen\\n            multiple therapists and I lay in bed at night[,] and I can’t\\n            sleep because I still feel like I’m in the garage\\n            sometimes. . . .\\n\\n            I have a hard time making friends because I don’t trust\\n            my friends anymore. . . . it destroyed me, honestly.\\n\\n            Like, I’ve lost my sense of self-worth.               I lost\\n            everything. I feel like -- some days, I feel like I’ll never\\n            not be in that garage, honestly. Like, I wonder how I\\n            can ever not be traumatized by this and I don’t think\\n            that’s a possibility.\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n\\nIn response to being asked, “do you fear for your safety and the possibility of\\n\\nharm from [respondent],” the victim explained:\\n\\n            I do. I really, I do. I think the only reason I have any\\n            sort of peace of mind is because I know I have this\\n            temporary right now and I’m so terrified that if I didn’t\\n            have it, he would be angry that I’ve spent three years\\n            just asking for this.\\n\\n            Just asking for a sense of security. I think he would\\n            definitely harass me for challenging it. I feel like every\\n            time -- I can’t even begin to explain the, like, terror that\\n            I feel every day when I am unsure of my surroundings.\\n\\n            I can’t even -- I have a hard time even going shopping\\n            by myself because what if something happens? How\\n            will I defend myself? And if there’s no protective\\n            order, then he has no consequences. . . .\\n\\n            He could harass me over the Internet. He could come\\n            to my residence, come to my work, find me anywhere.\\n\\n            [(emphases added).]\\n                                        26\\n As opposed to speculating about the possible risk to her safety or well-being,\\n\\nthe victim’s testimony amplified, albeit more than three-years later, the actual\\n\\nrisk to her “safety” or “well-being.” Thus, the victim’s inability to provide\\n\\nevidence at the first FPO hearing, coupled with the additional testimony she\\n\\nprovided at the second FPO hearing, underscores the difficulty of proving the\\n\\n“possibility of future risk to [a victim’s] safety or well-being” by a\\n\\npreponderance of the evidence ten days after application for an emergency ex\\n\\nparte TPO. Contrary to the majority’s holding, having the benefit of hindsight\\n\\nin this case illustrates how N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(a)(2)’s standard will not always\\n\\nbe “easily satisfied.” Ante at ___ (slip op. at 3, 22). 8\\n\\n\\n8\\n   It is unsurprising that, in cases where a TPO was filed shortly after a\\npredicate act occurs, a victim may lack proof showing the “possibility of future\\nrisk to the safety or well-being of the alleged victim.” It is common for\\nvictims of sexual violence to experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\\ndepression, anxiety, increased suicide risk, disordered eating, substance abuse,\\ndifficulty functioning, and other psychological conditions. See Amy C.\\nGraham et al., Sexual Assault, Campus Resource Use, and Psychological\\nDistress in Undergraduate Women, 36 J. Interpersonal Violence, 10361,\\n10362-63 (2021) (generally discussing the psychological effects of sexual\\nassault on women). Moreover, women who were drinking alcohol prior to a\\nsexual assault -- like the victim here -- are more likely to experience\\npsychological distress. Id. at 10363; see also Karen Rothman et al., Sexual\\nAssault Among Women in College: Immediate and Long-Term Associations\\nwith Mental Health, Psychological Functioning, and Romantic Relationships,\\n36 J. Interpersonal Violence, 9600, 9602, 9615 (2021) (emphasizing that\\nsexual assault is “consistently linked” with PTSD “within days” of the event,\\nunreliable memory, fear and anxiety, suicidality, and depression); Emily R.\\n\\n                                         27\\n       Nevertheless, and like the first FPO judge, the remand judge also found\\n\\nthat respondent committed one or more predicate acts. The remand judge\\n\\nrecognized SASPA’s lenient standard and requirement to “consider” the\\n\\n“possibility of future risk to the [victim’s] safety or well-being.” Relying on\\n\\nthis new testimony, the remand judge stated:\\n\\n            the [v]ictim testified that she has seen several therapists\\n            to deal with the trauma that she has endured. She has\\n            ongoing difficulty sleeping. She has intimacy issues.\\n            The long-term effects are real and traumatizing to her.\\n            It is clear that without the [FPO], any efforts she has\\n            made in therapy could be eviscerated. Her testimony\\n            that the only peace of mind she has is the security that\\n            this order has provided to her, with the attendant\\n            consequences to [respondent] should he violate the\\n            [FPO], is legitimate and truthful. There is a significant\\n            risk to her psychological well-being should this order\\n            not remain in effect.\\n\\nThus, in line with my reading of SASPA, there is sufficient credible evidence\\n\\nto support the finding that there is a risk to the victim’s “safety” and “well-\\n\\nbeing,” which supports the continued added protections afforded by N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(f).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDworkin et al., Associations Between Sexual Assault and Suicidal Thoughts\\nand Behavior: A Meta-Analysis, 14 Psych. Trauma: Theory, Rsch., Prac., &\\nPol’y, 1208, 1211 (2020) (same). Such psychological consequences impact a\\nvictim’s ability to present evidence by a preponderance of the evidence in\\nsupport of an FPO.\\n                                       28\\n                                         V.\\n\\n      In sum, it is my view that to obtain an FPO, SASPA does not require a\\n\\nvictim to also demonstrate, beyond proving the commission of a predicate act,\\n\\nthat without an FPO there exists a “possibility of future risk to the [victim’s]\\n\\nsafety or well-being.” The victim here established by a preponderance of the\\n\\nevidence, at both FPO hearings, that respondent committed one or more\\n\\npredicate acts. The judges then correctly found that the victim is entitled to an\\n\\nFPO prohibiting the respondent from contacting the victim and committing\\n\\nfurther predicate acts under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-16(e). The “possibility” of what\\n\\nmight or might not happen in the future is simply one factor among many\\n\\nothers that the judge “shall consider” when fashioning additional relief in the\\n\\nFPO; it is not an element of proof. That is exactly why the remand judge, after\\n\\nhearing more testimony, allowed the additional restrictions under N.J.S.A.\\n\\n2C:14-16(f)(3) and (4) to remain in effect.\\n\\n      Accordingly, I would uphold the FPO and those referenced additional\\n\\nrestrictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        29\\n '),\n",

Law, on the brief).\\n\\n\\n                                  PER CURIAM\\n\\n\\n        J.A. was adjudicated delinquent of aggravated sexual assault and\\n\\nendangering the welfare of a child in 1999. The adjudication stemmed from\\n\\nJ.A.’s conduct when he was fifteen years old.\\n\\n        In 2000 and 2001, J.A. was adjudicated delinquent, respectively, of\\n\\nreceiving stolen property and second-degree robbery. He was sentenced to a\\n\\ncustodial term of four years at a juvenile facility for the latter offense and\\n\\nreleased in 2004. He has not committed an offense since then.\\n\\n        To be eligible to terminate the registration and community notification\\n\\nrequirements of Megan’s Law, individuals who are required to register must\\n\\ndemonstrate that they have been offense-free for “15 years following\\n\\nconviction or release from a correctional facility for any term of imprisonment\\n\\nimposed, whichever is later.” N.J.S.A. 2C:7-2(f) (emphasis added). They\\n\\nmust also show they are “not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.”\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n        J.A. applied to terminate his Megan’s Law obligations. The trial court\\n\\nfound that he was ineligible under subsection (f) because he had not remained\\n\\noffense-free after committing a predicate sex offense in 1999. The trial court\\n\\n                                         2\\n also considered the public safety prong and found that J.A. satisfied it. The\\n\\ncourt explained that J.A. had been “productive and law-abiding” and had led\\n\\n“an exemplary life since” his juvenile adjudication. The court agreed with\\n\\ntestimony from an expert psychologist that J.A. “present[ed] a very low risk to\\n\\nreoffend.” Nonetheless, the trial court stated it felt “constrained” by case law\\n\\nto deny the motion.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division affirmed. J.A. now argues to this Court that\\n\\nmandatory lifetime registration under subsection (f) is unconstitutional as\\n\\napplied to a registrant who committed a predicate sex offense as a juvenile and\\n\\nlater commits another offense.\\n\\n      Because J.A. was adjudicated delinquent and not convicted of a sex\\n\\noffense, he is required to satisfy the public safety prong of subsection (f), not\\n\\nthe offense-free prong. See In re Registrant R.H., ___ N.J. ___, ___ (2024)\\n\\n(slip op. at 3). Based on the reasoning of R.H. and the trial court’s finding that\\n\\nJ.A. does not pose a safety threat, he is eligible for termination of his Megan’s\\n\\nLaw obligations under subsection (f). We therefore reverse the judgment of\\n\\nthe Appellate Division and remand the matter to the trial court to enter an\\n\\nappropriate order.\\n\\n      Under the circumstances, we do not reach J.A.’s constitutional\\n\\narguments.

It has been neither reviewed nor\\napproved by the Court and may not summarize all portions of the opinion.\\n\\n    Susan Seago v. Board of Trustees, Teachers’ Pension and Annuity Fund\\n                              (A-9-23) (087786)\\n\\nArgued January 29, 2024 -- Decided May 22, 2024\\n\\nFASCIALE, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       The Court considers whether, under the circumstances presented, the Board of\\nTrustees of the Teachers’ Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF Board) acted arbitrarily,\\ncapriciously, or unreasonably when it denied petitioner Susan Seago’s application\\nfor an interfund transfer from her expired Public Employees’ Retirement System\\n(PERS) account to her active Teachers’ Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) account.\\n\\n       The Edison Township Board of Education (Edison BOE) hired Seago as a\\nparaprofessional in 2004, and she became a member of PERS that same year. At the\\nbeginning of the 2017-2018 school year, Seago resigned from her position as a\\nparaprofessional and became employed as a teacher by the Edison BOE. By that\\ntime, her PERS account had reached “Tier 1” membership status and had vested.\\n\\n       On July 6, 2017, Seago filled out an “Application for Interfund Transfer” to\\ntransfer her PERS credits and contributions to her new TPAF account. According to\\nthe printed instructions on the application, Seago and the Edison BOE were required\\nto complete different portions of the application. Seago completed and signed her\\nsection and sent the application to the Edison BOE. Although the Edison BOE\\nenrolled Seago as a TPAF member in September 2017, it did not complete its portion\\nof Seago’s interfund transfer application at that time.\\n\\n       In early March 2019, the Department of the Treasury, Division of Pensions\\nand Benefits (Division) notified Seago that she had not contributed to her PERS\\naccount since June 30, 2017. Seago spoke with representatives of the Edison BOE’s\\nhuman resources department, who assured her that all she needed to do to effectuate\\nher interfund transfer request was to complete “the top portion” of the application, as\\nshe had already done. On June 30, 2019, Seago’s membership in PERS ceased\\npursuant to N.J.S.A. 43:15A-7(e). At that time, and unbeknownst to Seago, the\\nEdison BOE had still not completed its portion of Seago’s interfund transfer\\napplication.\\n\\n\\n                                          1\\n        On August 31, 2020, the Edison BOE realized that it failed to send Seago’s\\ninterfund transfer application to the Division on time. The Edison BOE attempted to\\nrectify the situation by completing its portion of the application and submitting it to\\nthe Division that same day. Along with the application, the Edison BOE sent a letter\\nadmitting its mistake. The Division informed Seago and the Edison BOE that,\\ndespite the Edison BOE’s conceded error, Seago’s application for interfund transfer\\ncould not be processed because her PERS account had expired.\\n\\n      The Edison BOE challenged the denial of Seago’s interfund transfer\\napplication. The TPAF Board again denied the interfund transfer request, and the\\nAppellate Division affirmed. The Court granted certification. 255 N.J. 411 (2023).\\n\\nHELD: The TPAF Board acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably when it\\ndenied Seago’s interfund transfer application. Under the unique facts of this case,\\nequity requires that the TPAF Board grant Seago’s interfund transfer application.\\nSeago’s reasonable and good-faith attempts to ensure that her interfund transfer\\napplication was timely filed, coupled with the absence of apparent harm to the\\npension fund, necessitate this outcome.\\n\\n1. PERS and TPAF are two distinct retirement systems operated by the State.\\nMembership in PERS “shall cease if [the member] shall discontinue [their] service\\nfor more than two consecutive years.” N.J.S.A. 43:15A-7(e) (emphasis added).\\nPERS contributions and credits may, however, be transferred to a different State-\\noperated retirement system, including TPAF, which expressly requires that\\nmembership in the former system has not expired or been withdrawn. N.J.A.C.\\n17:3-7.1(b). To effectuate such a transfer, as relevant here, “[a] member . . . must\\nfile an ‘Application for Interfund Transfer,’” N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b)(1), “no more than\\ntwo years from the date of the last contribution in the PERS,” N.J.A.C. 17:3-\\n7.1(b)(5)(ii). Regarding interfund transfers, the Division’s Teachers’ Pension and\\nAnnuity Fund (TPAF) Member Guidebook states in part that “an Application for\\nInterfund Transfer should be submitted by your employer to the [Division].”\\nNotably, the ability to transfer service credit and contributions from one retirement\\nsystem to another may directly impact a member’s retirement benefits, including by\\nmaintaining tier status. (pp. 13-16)\\n\\n2. Generally, equitable principles are rarely applied against governmental entities.\\nUnder the appropriate circumstances, however, equitable estoppel may apply unless\\nits application would prejudice essential governmental functions. As the TPAF\\nBoard has conceded in this appeal, it has “the authority to apply equitable principles\\nto provide a remedy when justice so demands, provided the power is used rarely and\\nsparingly, and does no harm to the overall pension scheme.” See Sellers v. Bd. of\\nTrs., PFRS, 399 N.J. Super. 51, 62 (App. Div. 2008). This is particularly true where\\nproviding an equitable remedy would require the TPAF Board only to relax its own\\n                                           2\\n regulation, not a statute duly enacted by the Legislature. Courts consider several\\nfactors, as outlined by the Appellate Division in Sellers, when determining whether\\nto apply equitable principles in the “interests of justice” to circumstances presented\\nby a member of a retirement system: “whether the government failed to ‘turn square\\ncorners’”; whether the pension member “acted in good faith and reasonably”; the\\nharm a member will suffer; the harm to the pension scheme; and any other relevant\\nfactors in the interest of fairness. See id. at 62-63. The Court explains the\\nconsiderations that underly those factors. (pp. 17-21)\\n\\n3. Here, it is evident that the TPAF Board did not “turn square corners” when\\nconsidering Seago’s interfund transfer application in light of the reasons provided\\nfor the delayed submission. The TPAF Board did not reasonably and adequately\\nconsider the Edison BOE’s admitted responsibility and how the Guidebook,\\napplication, and regulations led to the late filing of Seago’s interfund transfer\\napplication, through no fault of Seago’s. In addition, Seago acted in good faith and\\ntook reasonable steps to attempt to ensure that her interfund transfer application was\\nfiled. Seago completed her portion of the application timely and reasonably\\nbelieved, based on reassurances by her employer coupled with the instructions in the\\nGuidebook and on the application itself, that it was the Edison BOE’s responsibility\\nto complete and submit her application. Moreover, Seago would suffer significant\\nharm from the denial of her interfund transfer application: she will be unable to\\ntransfer her PERS “Tier 1” membership status, which means she will have to wait 5\\nadditional years to retire and will ultimately receive a lower monthly pension\\nallowance. The record is devoid of evidence that the fund would face significant\\nharm if Seago’s application is treated as timely. Cases like Seago’s only occur two\\nto three times per year, and the Court’s holding here is a narrow one that applies\\nspecifically to Seago’s unique circumstances. (pp. 21-25)\\n\\n4. The Court stresses that it does not hold that it is the employer’s responsibility to\\nfile an interfund transfer application on a member’s behalf, or that a member will be\\nentitled to an interfund transfer in every case in which a former employer fails to\\ntimely complete an interfund transfer application on the member’s behalf. Rather,\\nunder the specific circumstances of this case, the Court concludes that as a matter of\\nequity the TPAF Board must grant Seago’s interfund transfer application as if it were\\ntimely filed.

Seago’s last contribution to her PERS account was on June 30,\\n\\n2017. Although she completed her portion of the interfund transfer application\\n\\non July 6, 2017 -- well before the expiration of her PERS account -- her\\n\\nemployer admittedly “overlooked” her application and failed to timely\\n\\ncomplete and file it. Despite assuring Seago that her only responsibility to\\n\\nsuccessfully effectuate an interfund transfer was to complete the “top portion”\\n\\nof the interfund transfer application -- which she did -- Seago’s employer did\\n\\n                                       2\\n not realize it failed to submit Seago’s application until after Seago’s PERS\\n\\naccount had expired. Consequently, the TPAF Board denied Seago’s interfund\\n\\ntransfer application as out of time. She appealed, and the Appellate Division\\n\\nupheld the TPAF Board’s determination.\\n\\n      We hold that the TPAF Board acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and\\n\\nunreasonably when it denied Seago’s interfund transfer application. Under the\\n\\nunique facts of this case, we conclude that equity requires that the TPAF Board\\n\\ngrant Seago’s interfund transfer application. Seago’s reasonable and good-\\n\\nfaith attempts to ensure that her interfund transfer application was timely filed,\\n\\ncoupled with the absence of apparent harm to the pension fund, necessitate this\\n\\noutcome. We therefore reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment and direct\\n\\nthe TPAF Board to grant Seago’s interfund transfer application as if it were\\n\\ntimely filed.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      We derive the following facts from the parties’ submissions and\\n\\ninformation provided to us at oral argument because Seago was denied a\\n\\nhearing in the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). Importantly, the TPAF\\n\\nBoard has maintained that it does not dispute and has assumed the truth of\\n\\nSeago’s allegations.\\n\\n                                        3\\n       The Edison Township Board of Education (Edison BOE) hired Seago as\\n\\na paraprofessional in 2004. As a result of this public employment, Seago\\n\\nbecame a member of PERS that same year. Seago continued her role as a\\n\\nparaprofessional and contributed to her PERS account until 2017. At the\\n\\nbeginning of the 2017-2018 school year, Seago resigned from her position as a\\n\\nparaprofessional and became employed as a teacher by the Edison BOE. Even\\n\\nthough Seago’s employer did not change, the change in position required that\\n\\nSeago become a member of TPAF and that her pension contributions be made\\n\\nto TPAF. Thus, Seago’s last contribution to her PERS account was on June\\n\\n30, 2017. By that time, her PERS account had acquired 152 months of credit\\n\\nand had reached “Tier 1” membership status. 1 Moreover, Seago had a total of\\n\\n$20,086.49 in pension contributions, and her account had vested. 2\\n\\n\\n1\\n  “Tier” membership status is not specifically addressed in the PERS or TPAF\\nstatutory scheme. Rather, as identified by the TPAF Board, it is language used\\nby the Department of the Treasury, Division of Pensions and Benefits\\n(Division), for ease of reference and exists in both the PERS and TPAF\\nmember guidebooks provided by the Division. However, a member’s “tier”\\nstatus is based on provisions in both the PERS and TPAF statutory schemes\\nwhich establish rules for retirement tethered to a member’s date of enrollment.\\nSee, e.g., N.J.S.A. 43:15A-47 to -48 (examples of statutory provisions\\nsupporting the “tier” designations under PERS); N.J.S.A. 18A:66-43 to -44\\n(examples of statutory provisions supporting the “tier” designations under\\nTPAF).\\n2\\n Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 43:15A-38, a PERS member’s account vests after the\\nmember has completed ten years of service. If a PERS account is vested, the\\nmember may be eligible for deferred retirement.\\n                                      4\\n         On July 6, 2017, Seago filled out an “Application for Interfund\\n\\nTransfer” to transfer her PERS credits and contributions to her new TPAF\\n\\naccount. According to the printed instructions on the application, Seago and\\n\\nthe Edison BOE were required to complete different portions of the\\n\\napplication. Seago completed and signed her section of the application, “the\\n\\ntop portion,” and subsequently sent the application to the Edison BOE.\\n\\nAlthough the Edison BOE enrolled Seago as a TPAF member in September\\n\\n2017, it did not complete its portion of Seago’s interfund transfer application -\\n\\n- the portion to be completed by the member’s “former” employer -- at that\\n\\ntime.\\n\\n        In early March 2019, the Department of the Treasury, Division of\\n\\nPensions and Benefits (Division) notified Seago by letter that she had not\\n\\ncontributed to her PERS account since June 30, 2017. That letter did not\\n\\nexplicitly state that Seago’s PERS account was set to expire in June 2019, two\\n\\nyears after her last contribution. It did, however, provide the date of her last\\n\\ncontribution, stated that she was still a PERS member, and explained that she\\n\\nwas eligible to apply for retirement benefits. Seago did not respond to the\\n\\nletter. Instead, Seago spoke with representatives of the Edison BOE’s human\\n\\nresources department who assured her that all she needed to do to effectuate\\n\\nher interfund transfer request was to complete “the top portion” of the\\n\\n                                        5\\n application, as she had already done. At oral argument, Seago’s counsel\\n\\ndetailed how the Edison BOE informed Seago that it did in fact timely file her\\n\\ninterfund transfer application, despite the fact that it had not done so. Counsel\\n\\nfor the TPAF Board did not challenge that assertion.\\n\\n      On June 30, 2019, Seago’s membership in PERS ceased pursuant to\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 43:15A-7(e). At that time, and unbeknownst to Seago, the Edison\\n\\nBOE had still not completed its portion of Seago’s interfund transfer\\n\\napplication. Consequently, Seago’s opportunity to apply for an interfund\\n\\ntransfer lapsed under N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b), which provides that a TPAF\\n\\nmember is only eligible to transfer membership if the former membership “has\\n\\nnot expired.”\\n\\n      Thereafter, on September 17, 2019, the Division notified Seago of her\\n\\noptions for the pension contributions she made to her PERS account: apply for\\n\\nwithdrawal of a lump sum of her contributions; apply for a rollover of\\n\\ncontributions to an Individual Retirement Account or an employer’s retirement\\n\\nplan; or apply for the monthly retirement allowance.\\n\\n      On August 31, 2020, the Edison BOE realized that it failed to send\\n\\nSeago’s interfund transfer application to the Division on time because,\\n\\naccording to the Edison BOE, it “missed out/overlooked” Seago’s application.\\n\\nThe Edison BOE attempted to rectify the situation by completing the “former\\n\\n                                        6\\n employing agency” portion of the application and submitting it to the Division\\n\\nthat same day in August 2020 -- over three years after Seago completed her\\n\\nsection of the application and over a year after Seago’s PERS account expired.\\n\\n      Along with Seago’s application, the Edison BOE sent the Division a\\n\\nletter admitting its mistake. That August 2020 letter, authored by the Edison\\n\\nBOE’s payroll supervisor and business administrator, stated that\\n\\n            [Seago] had filled out an Interfund Transfer form on\\n            July 6th, 2017. I see that her form was missed\\n            out/overlooked by Payroll Dept. and not sent to NJ\\n            Pensions.\\n\\n            Please accept this as a letter of request for Interfund\\n            Transfer from PERS to TPAF. This oversight was not\\n            [Seago’s] fault. Can we please restore her enrollment\\n            date and process this form for her[?]\\n\\n      The Division received Seago’s application for interfund transfer from\\n\\nthe Edison BOE on September 10, 2020. Later that month, the Division\\n\\ninformed Seago and the Edison BOE that, despite the Edison BOE’s conceded\\n\\nerror, Seago’s application for interfund transfer could not be processed\\n\\nbecause her PERS account expired on June 30, 2019.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      In October 2020, the Edison BOE challenged the Division’s denial of\\n\\nSeago’s interfund transfer application in a letter, reiterating that the delay was\\n\\ndue to the Edison BOE’s own mistake. The Edison BOE explained:\\n                                         7\\n             We are fully aware of the expiration of [Seago’s] PERS\\n            credit; however, we as the employer had not submitted\\n            her interfund transfer form in 2017 when she filled out\\n            her portion of the form.\\n\\n            . . . . We [are] not sure which of [the Edison BOE’s\\n            employees] was responsible for the completion of\\n            interfund transfer applications; however, one of them\\n            never submitted Ms. Seago’s application. When our\\n            current Payroll Supervisor . . . discovered the error, she\\n            immediately completed the form and submitted it.\\n            Unfortunately, it was after Ms. Seago’s PERS 2-year\\n            grace period expired.\\n\\n            ....\\n\\n                  We are also aware of the fact that Ms. Seago had\\n            received several notices that her PERS grace period was\\n            about to expire; but she claims that she was told by our\\n            Human Resources Department, that when she became a\\n            teacher, she didn’t have to do anything to transfer her\\n            time, except to fill out the top portion of the interfund\\n            transfer form. We do not doubt that she was told this,\\n            because at the time, this was all she needed to do.\\n\\n      Following a TPAF Board meeting in December 2020, the TPAF Board\\n\\naffirmed the Division’s determination and denied Seago’s interfund transfer\\n\\nrequest, concluding initially that it “ha[d] no authority to grant Ms. Seago’s\\n\\nrequest in accordance with N.J.S.A. 43:15A-7(e) and N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1.”\\n\\nSeago appealed the TPAF Board’s denial and requested a hearing in the OAL.\\n\\nThe TPAF Board summarily denied the request for a hearing because,\\n\\naccording to the TPAF Board, there were “no factual issues to be adduced.”\\n                                        8\\n       In its final administrative determination, the TPAF Board again denied\\n\\nSeago’s interfund transfer request, reasoning that “the statutes and relevant\\n\\ncase law governing TPAF,” including N.J.S.A. 43:15A-7(e) and N.J.A.C. 17:3-\\n\\n7.1, “do not permit the Board to grant” such a request. The TPAF Board\\n\\nemphasized that interfund transfers are not mandatory, but rather are optional\\n\\nat the member’s request. Thus, the TPAF Board concluded that “if an\\n\\nemployee chooses to exercise the option, the responsibility to timely file the\\n\\nrequired application lies with the member, not the employer.”\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      Seago appealed the TPAF Board’s final administrative determination to\\n\\nthe Appellate Division. The Appellate Division affirmed the decision,\\n\\nmaintaining that N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b)(5)(ii) provides that it is the member’s\\n\\nresponsibility to fill out and file the interfund transfer application within two\\n\\nyears from the date of the last contribution. The appellate court rejected\\n\\nSeago’s argument that the TPAF Member Guidebook says otherwise,\\n\\nreasoning that the “TPAF Member Guidebook does not supersede the language\\n\\nof an unambiguous statute” and that Seago was therefore the one responsible\\n\\nfor filing and submitting her application, not the Edison BOE. Moreover, the\\n\\nAppellate Division declined to find that applying N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b)’s two-\\n\\nyear limitation to Seago’s circumstances was inequitable.\\n\\n                                         9\\n       We granted Seago’s petition for certification. 255 N.J. 411 (2023).\\n\\n                                       II.\\n\\n      Seago asks us to reverse the Appellate Division’s judgment and argues\\n\\nthat the TPAF Board acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably when it\\n\\ndenied her interfund transfer application. She emphasizes that the relevant\\n\\npension statutes are to be construed liberally and that this Court should not\\n\\nemploy an “overly stringent interpretation” of those statutes, especially\\n\\nconsidering her “significant public service.” Seago further argues that she\\n\\nacted with “diligence and good faith,” and reasonably relied on her employer’s\\n\\nrepresentations concerning the status of her interfund transfer application.\\n\\nSeago cites to the TPAF Member Guidebook, which places the burden on the\\n\\nemployer to submit interfund transfer applications. Lastly, Seago contends\\n\\nthat this Court should weigh the financial implications of her being unable to\\n\\ntransfer her credits and losing her “Tier 1” membership status against the\\n\\nprejudice to the pension fund, which, according to Seago, is minimal compared\\n\\nto the financial impact on her.\\n\\n      The TPAF Board argues that this Court should defer to its reasonable\\n\\ndetermination concerning Seago’s application. It contends that a liberal\\n\\nconstruction of the relevant pension statutes “does not enlarge the rights\\n\\nprovided by statute” and that the Legislature provided “clear directives” that\\n\\n                                       10\\n apply to Seago’s circumstances, making her ineligible to complete an interfund\\n\\ntransfer of her PERS contributions and service credit.\\n\\n      The TPAF Board further argues that Seago did not act with reasonable\\n\\ndiligence and that “[i]t was her own failure to ensure that her application for\\n\\ninterfund transfer was filed” that resulted in her ineligibility to transfer her\\n\\naccount now. In support, the TPAF Board emphasizes that the Division sent\\n\\nSeago notices informing her that she still had an active PERS account and that\\n\\nSeago should have contacted the Division directly to obtain more information\\n\\nupon receiving those notices. Because she failed to do so, the TPAF Board\\n\\nargues that this Court should reject Seago’s equitable arguments. At oral\\n\\nargument, the TPAF Board conceded that it did in fact have the authority to\\n\\ngrant Seago equitable relief but maintained that Seago’s circumstances did not\\n\\nwarrant such relief.\\n\\n                                        III.\\n\\n                                         A.\\n\\n      “Judicial review of [an] agency determination[] is limited.” Allstars\\n\\nAuto Grp., Inc. v.

Paraprofessionals who accept\\n\\n“employment in the service of the State” are members of PERS and not TPAF.\\n\\nSee N.J.S.A. 43:15A-7.\\n\\n      Membership in PERS “shall cease if [the member] shall discontinue\\n\\n[their] service for more than two consecutive years.” N.J.S.A. 43:15A-7(e)\\n\\n(emphasis added). PERS contributions and credits may, however, be\\n\\ntransferred to a different State-operated retirement system. PERS members\\n\\nmay transfer their service credit and contributions from their PERS account to\\n\\nTPAF upon enrollment in TPAF, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:66-15.1(c):\\n\\n            A member who is a member of [PERS] . . . at the time\\n            of enrollment in [TPAF] and who within three years of\\n            the date of that enrollment ceases to be an active\\n            contributing member of [PERS] may transfer all service\\n                                     13\\n             credit in [PERS] to [TPAF] upon application and\\n            transfer of the member’s contributions from [PERS] to\\n            [TPAF].\\n\\n            [(emphasis added).]\\n\\n      However, an interfund transfer does not occur automatically.\\n\\nAdministrative regulations provide guidance to TPAF members regarding how\\n\\nto successfully complete an interfund transfer. See N.J.A.C. 17:3-1 to -7\\n\\n(regulations governing TPAF). According to N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b), a TPAF\\n\\nmember is generally “eligible to transfer membership from another State-\\n\\nadministered defined benefit retirement system, provided the membership has\\n\\nnot expired or has not been withdrawn and provided that all service eligible for\\n\\nparticipation has ceased.” (emphasis added). To effectuate such a transfer,\\n\\nwhich includes transferring service credit and contributions, “[a] member . . .\\n\\nmust file an ‘Application for Interfund Transfer.’” N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b)(1)\\n\\n(emphases added). And the “Application for Interfund Transfer” from PERS\\n\\nto TPAF must occur “no more than two years from the date of the last\\n\\ncontribution in the PERS, or the member’s PERS account has not expired due\\n\\nto the provisions of N.J.S.A. 43:15A-8.” N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b)(5)(ii).\\n\\n      The Division has also made available to TPAF members a TPAF\\n\\n“Member Guidebook” designed to provide “a summary description of the\\n\\nbenefits of the plan” and to “outline[] the rules and regulations governing the\\n\\n                                       14\\n plan.” N.J. Div. of Pension & Benefits, Teachers’ Pension and Annuity Fund\\n\\n(TPAF) Member Guidebook 4 (July 2021). The Guidebook’s foreword\\n\\nincludes a caveat that “if there is a conflict with statutes governing the plan or\\n\\nregulations implementing the statutes, the statutes and regulations will take\\n\\nprecedence” over the Guidebook. Ibid. Regarding interfund transfers, the\\n\\nGuidebook states:\\n\\n            If you are eligible and interested in transferring your\\n            membership account, an online Enrollment Application\\n            for the new retirement system and an Application for\\n            Interfund Transfer should be submitted by your\\n            employer to the [Division]. Applications must be\\n            received within [thirty] days of the date you meet the\\n            eligibility requirements of the new retirement system.\\n\\n            [Id. at 11 (emphasis added). 3]\\n\\n      Notably, the ability to transfer service credit and contributions from one\\n\\nretirement system to another may directly impact a member’s retirement\\n\\nbenefits. For instance, and pertinent to this appeal, N.J.S.A. 43:15A-47(a)\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Seago specifically relies on this section of the Guidebook in support of her\\narguments. However, the Appellate Division determined that this section of\\nthe Guidebook did not apply to Seago’s circumstances because it governs\\ntransfers from TPAF to PERS, not PERS to TPAF. Although this section of\\nthe Guidebook generally covers transfers from TPAF to other State-\\nadministered retirement systems, including PERS, the Guidebook specifically\\nnotes within the first paragraph of that same section that interfund transfers\\ncan be made from TPAF to different State-administered retirement systems\\nand “vice versa.” TPAF Member Guidebook at 11.\\n                                        15\\n provides that a PERS member who joined prior to November 2008 may retire\\n\\nand receive benefits at age 60. The Division designates members who fall\\n\\nwithin this category as having “Tier 1” or “Tier 2” membership status. In\\n\\ncontrast, “Tier 5” membership status encompasses individuals who became\\n\\nPERS members after June 28, 2011 -- those individuals are only eligible to\\n\\nreceive retirement benefits at age 65. N.J.S.A. 43:15A-47(c). Further, PERS\\n\\nmembers who have “Tier 5” membership status are entitled to a lower monthly\\n\\npension allowance as compared to “Tier 1” members. See N.J.S.A. 43:15A-\\n\\n48.\\n\\n      TPAF mirrors those provisions and “tier” statuses. See N.J.S.A.\\n\\n18A:66-43, -44; see also TPAF Member Guidebook at 25. And importantly,\\n\\nwhen a member successfully completes an interfund transfer, the member may\\n\\nretain their “tier” status from the former retirement system to the new\\n\\nretirement system. See N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b)(4) (“The member’s service\\n\\ncredits and enrollment date established in the former system shall be\\n\\ntransferred into the new membership account.” (emphasis added)).\\n\\n                                       V.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      To determine whether the TPAF Board acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or\\n\\nunreasonably when it denied Seago’s request for an interfund transfer, we view\\n\\n                                       16\\n the unique facts of this case from the lens of equity. Generally, equitable\\n\\nprinciples are rarely applied against governmental entities. See Middletown\\n\\nTwp. Policemen’s Benevolent Ass’n Loc. No. 124 v. Township of\\n\\nMiddletown, 162 N.J. 361, 367 (2000) (“Equitable estoppel is ‘rarely invoked\\n\\nagainst a governmental entity.’” (quoting Wood v. Borough of Wildwood\\n\\nCrest, 319 N.J. Super. 650, 656 (App. Div. 1999))). However, as to the\\n\\nprinciple of equitable estoppel, we have held that it “may be invoked” against\\n\\na governmental entity “where interests of justice, morality and common\\n\\nfairness clearly dictate that course.” Ibid. (quoting Gruber v. Mayor & Twp.\\n\\nComm. of Raritan, 39 N.J. 1, 13 (1962)).\\n\\n      Thus, under “the appropriate circumstances,” equitable estoppel may\\n\\napply unless its application “would ‘prejudice essential governmental\\n\\nfunctions.’” Ibid. (quoting Wood, 319 N.J. Super. at 656); see also Skulski v.\\n\\nNolan, 68 N.J. 179, 198 (1975) (“[E]quitable considerations are relevant in\\n\\nevaluating the propriety of conduct taken after substantial reliance by those\\n\\nwhose interests are affected by subsequent actions . . . [in order] ‘to avoid\\n\\nwrong or injury ensuing from reasonable reliance upon such conduct.’”\\n\\n(citation omitted) (quoting Summer Cottagers’ Ass’n v. Cape May, 19 N.J.\\n\\n493, 504 (1955))).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        17\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      In considering Seago’s circumstances and the applicability of equitable\\n\\nprinciples, we find that Sellers v. Board of Trustees, PFRS, 399 N.J. Super. 51\\n\\n(App. Div. 2008), provides well-reasoned guidance.\\n\\n      In Sellers, the plaintiff appealed a final determination by the Board of\\n\\nTrustees of the New Jersey Police and Firemen’s Retirement System (PFRS)\\n\\ndenying his PFRS enrollment on the ground that he had exceeded the statutory\\n\\nmaximum age for enrollment, which consequently rendered him unable to\\n\\npursue employment as a firefighter. 399 N.J. Super. at 52-53, 55. In deciding\\n\\nto leave his former employment to pursue a firefighter position, both the\\n\\nplaintiff and the township employer that had offered him the position operated\\n\\nunder the mistaken belief that the plaintiff’s age would be “adjusted” to reflect\\n\\nhis time as a police officer and years of military service under applicable\\n\\nstatutory law, such that he would satisfy the qualifying firefighter age\\n\\nrequirements. Id. at 53-54. The plaintiff argued that equitable principles\\n\\nshould be applied to his circumstances because both he and the township\\n\\nemployer reasonably believed his age would be statutorily adjusted, which\\n\\nconsequently would have allowed the plaintiff to enroll in PFRS. Id. at 55.\\n\\nThe Appellate Division agreed with the plaintiff’s position and held that the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       18\\n PFRS Board should have considered equitable principles in the plaintiff’s case.\\n\\nId. at 62-63.\\n\\n      We hold that the equitable principles outlined in Sellers apply to the\\n\\ncircumstances presented in this appeal. As the TPAF Board has conceded in\\n\\nthis appeal, it has “the authority to apply equitable principles to provide a\\n\\nremedy when justice so demands, provided the power is used rarely and\\n\\nsparingly, and does no harm to the overall pension scheme.” Id. at 62. This is\\n\\nparticularly true where providing an equitable remedy would require the TPAF\\n\\nBoard only to relax its own regulation, not a statute duly enacted by the\\n\\nLegislature. See, e.g., Minsavage, 240 N.J. at 106, 108-09 (holding that “a\\n\\nretirement application, whether approved or not, may be reopened and\\n\\nmodified upon a showing of good cause, reasonable grounds, and reasonable\\n\\ndiligence,” despite relevant regulations to the contrary (citing N.J.A.C. 17:3-\\n\\n6.1(f)(5) and N.J.A.C. 17:3-6.3(a))).\\n\\n      We consider several factors, as outlined by the Appellate Division in\\n\\nSellers, when determining whether to apply equitable principles in the\\n\\n“interests of justice” to circumstances presented by a member of a retirement\\n\\nsystem: “whether the government failed to ‘turn square corners’”; whether the\\n\\npension member “acted in good faith and reasonably”; the harm a member will\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        19\\n suffer; the harm to the pension scheme; and any other relevant factors in the\\n\\ninterest of fairness. See id. at 62-63.\\n\\n      First, when considering whether the government failed to “turn square\\n\\ncorners,” this Court has emphasized how “governmental officials act solely in\\n\\nthe public interest” and that the government’s “primary obligation is to\\n\\ncomport itself with compunction and integrity.” F.M.C. Stores Co. v. Borough\\n\\nof Morris Plains, 100 N.J. 418, 426-27 (1985).\\n\\n      Next, it is important to consider whether the member acted in good faith,\\n\\n“exercised reasonable diligence,” and seeks relief “for good cause upon\\n\\nreasonable grounds.” Minsavage, 240 N.J. at 110. In Minsavage, we\\n\\ndetermined that the petitioner, a beneficiary of her deceased husband’s\\n\\nretirement benefits, could modify the retirement selection that her husband\\n\\npreviously made, provided “good cause, reasonable grounds, and reasonable\\n\\ndiligence are shown.” Id. at 105, 107. Thus, we remanded to provide the\\n\\npetitioner with an opportunity to make such a showing. Id. at 105.\\n\\n      We also consider the harm to the member, specifically the “degree of\\n\\nharm” to the member if relevant statutes or regulations are to be “strictly\\n\\nenforced,” and the harm to the pension fund. Sellers, 399 N.J. Super. at 62.\\n\\nAs we emphasized above, pension statutes should be “administered in favor of\\n\\nthe persons intended to be benefited,” Minsavage, 240 N.J. at 107 (quoting\\n\\n                                          20\\n Steinmann, 116 N.J. at 572), but “‘[a] potential adverse impact on the financial\\n\\nintegrity’ of the pension fund . . . may counsel against too broad an application\\n\\nof a pension statute in favor of a petitioner,” Francois v. Bd. of Trs., PERS,\\n\\n415 N.J. Super. 335, 349 (App. Div. 2010) (quoting Chaleff v. Bd. of Trs.,\\n\\nTPAF, 188 N.J. Super. 194, 197 (App. Div. 1983)).\\n\\n      For example, in Smith v. Department of Treasury, the Appellate\\n\\nDivision rejected the plaintiff’s interpretation of a PERS-related statute, in part\\n\\nbecause that interpretation would have expanded “the class of persons eligible\\n\\nfor . . . significantly greater” pension benefits and would therefore have placed\\n\\n“a greater strain on the financial integrity of the fund . . . and its future\\n\\navailability for those persons who are truly eligible for such benefits.” 390\\n\\nN.J. Super. 209, 215 (App. Div. 2007). Thus, “the fiscal integrity of the\\n\\npension funds” is another consideration when determining whether a member\\n\\nshould be granted equitable relief. Francois, 415 N.J. Super. at 349 (quoting\\n\\nDiMaria v. Bd. of Trs., PERS, 225 N.J. Super. 341, 354 (App. Div. 1988)).\\n\\n                                         VI.\\n\\n      Considering those equitable principles and the specific circumstances of\\n\\nthis appeal, we hold that the TPAF Board acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and\\n\\nunreasonably when it denied Seago’s interfund transfer application. As a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         21\\n result, we direct the TPAF Board to accept Seago’s interfund transfer\\n\\napplication as if it were timely filed.\\n\\n      It is evident that the TPAF Board did not “turn square corners” when\\n\\nconsidering Seago’s interfund transfer application in light of the reasons\\n\\nprovided for the delayed submission. Although the TPAF Board continues to\\n\\nclaim that it was Seago’s responsibility under N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b)(1) to\\n\\nsubmit the interfund transfer application, the TPAF Member Guidebook -- a\\n\\nGuidebook created to help TPAF members understand the retirement system\\n\\nand made available on the Division’s official website -- offers contradictory\\n\\nguidance. As the Guidebook indicates, for those “eligible and interested in\\n\\ntransferring [a] membership account, an online Enrollment Application for the\\n\\nnew retirement system and an Application for Interfund Transfer should be\\n\\nsubmitted by your employer to the [Division].” TPAF Member Guidebook at\\n\\n11 (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Notwithstanding the Guidebook’s initial disclaimer -- that statutes and\\n\\nregulations take precedence over the Guidebook -- it was unreasonable for the\\n\\nTPAF Board, under Seago’s particular circumstances, not to recognize the\\n\\nhardship that this contradiction caused Seago. See Steinmann, 116 N.J. at 576-\\n\\n78 (holding that the plaintiff demonstrated good cause to change her retirement\\n\\nselection because it was the TPAF “Board’s regulation, combined with its\\n\\n                                          22\\n failure to provide [the plaintiff] with information material to her decision, that\\n\\nprevented [the plaintiff] from selecting” a more favorable retirement option).\\n\\n      Moreover, the interfund transfer application that Seago filled out\\n\\nexplicitly provided that the application must be completed by the member and\\n\\nthe member’s former employer and must be submitted with the new enrollment\\n\\napplication for the retirement system into which the member is transferring.\\n\\nNotably, it is the employer’s “statutory responsibility” to enroll employees in\\n\\nTPAF and other State-operated retirement systems. See N.J.A.C. 17:1-3.1;\\n\\nN.J.A.C. 17:3-2.8. Considering its “primary obligation . . . to comport itself\\n\\nwith compunction and integrity,” F.M.C. Stores Co., 100 N.J. at 427, the\\n\\nTPAF Board did not reasonably and adequately consider the Edison BOE’s\\n\\nadmitted responsibility and how the Guidebook, application, and regulations\\n\\nled to the late filing of Seago’s interfund transfer application, through no fault\\n\\nof Seago’s.\\n\\n      In addition, Seago acted in good faith and took reasonable steps to\\n\\nattempt to ensure that her interfund transfer application was filed. Seago\\n\\ncompleted her portion of the application on July 6, 2017 -- approximately two\\n\\nyears prior to the expiration of her PERS account. And when Seago received\\n\\ninformation from the Division regarding her PERS account, she turned to her\\n\\nemployer who assured her that her only responsibility was to complete her\\n\\n                                        23\\n portion of the application. Seago’s employer admitted to the TPAF Board\\n\\nnumerous times that Seago’s late application was due to the Edison BOE’s own\\n\\nfailure, not Seago’s. Based on those reassurances by her employer, coupled\\n\\nwith the instructions in the Guidebook and on the application itself, Seago\\n\\nreasonably believed that it was the Edison BOE’s responsibility to complete\\n\\nand submit her application. Thus, we conclude Seago acted in good faith, with\\n\\nreasonable due diligence, and took reasonable steps to attempt to ensure that\\n\\nher interfund transfer application was filed.\\n\\n      Moreover, Seago will suffer significant harm if we uphold the TPAF\\n\\nBoard’s denial of her interfund transfer application: she will be unable to\\n\\ntransfer her PERS “Tier 1” membership status, thereby relegating her to “Tier\\n\\n5” membership status in TPAF. See N.J.A.C. 17:3-7.1(b)(4). And\\n\\nconsequently, if Seago remains in “Tier 5” membership status in TPAF, to\\n\\nreceive her full TPAF retirement benefits, Seago must wait until she reaches\\n\\nthe age of 65 rather than age 60, and she will ultimately receive a lower\\n\\nmonthly pension allowance. See N.J.S.A. 18A:66-43 to -44.\\n\\n      The record is devoid of evidence that the fund would face significant\\n\\nharm if Seago’s application is treated as timely. As the TPAF Board admitted\\n\\nat oral argument, cases like Seago’s only occur two to three times per year.\\n\\nImportantly, our holding is a narrow one that applies specifically to Seago’s\\n\\n                                       24\\n unique circumstances; thus, it will not “place a greater strain on the financial\\n\\nintegrity of the fund.” Cf. Smith, 390 N.J. Super. at 215.\\n\\n      We therefore conclude that, based on the record before us, the harm to\\n\\nthe pension system in granting Seago’s application does not appear to be\\n\\nsignificant as compared to the harm Seago will face if we allow the TPAF\\n\\nBoard’s decision to stand. Considering Seago’s circumstances and the\\n\\napplicable equitable principles, it is apparent that the TPAF Board acted\\n\\nunreasonably and that Seago’s interfund transfer application must be granted.\\n\\n      To be clear, we do not hold that it is in fact the employer’s responsibility\\n\\nto file an interfund transfer application on a member’s behalf. Additionally,\\n\\nwe do not hold that a member will be entitled to an interfund transfer in every\\n\\ncase in which a former employer fails to complete an interfund transfer\\n\\napplication on the member’s behalf within the time limitations provided in the\\n\\nregulations. Rather, under the specific circumstances presented in this case,\\n\\nwe conclude that as a matter of equity the TPAF Board must grant Seago’s\\n\\ninterfund transfer application as if it were timely filed.\\n\\n                                        VII.\\n\\n      Having concluded that the TPAF Board acted arbitrarily, capriciously,\\n\\nand unreasonably under the circumstances presented, we reverse the judgment\\n\\nof the Appellate Division and instruct the TPAF Board to grant Seago’s\\n\\n                                        25\\n application for an interfund transfer as if her application had initially been\\n\\ntimely filed.\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER APTER, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE FASCIALE’s\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        26\\n '),\n",

American Guarantee and Liability Insurance Company\\n                           (A-28-22) (087304)\\n\\nArgued September 27, 2023 -- Decided January 24, 2024\\n\\nPATTERSON, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n        In this insurance coverage action, plaintiff AC Ocean Walk, LLC (Ocean\\nWalk) seeks coverage under its commercial property insurance policies for losses\\nsustained during the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the COVID-19\\npandemic). Ocean Walk claims that by virtue of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in its\\nfacilities and its government-mandated temporary suspension of operations, it\\nsustained a “direct physical loss” of or “direct physical . . . damage” to its property\\nas those terms are used in the insurance policies issued by defendants. Ocean Walk\\nalso argues that an exclusion in the policies for certain claims based on\\n“contamination” did not bar its coverage claims.\\n\\n       In 2018, Ocean Walk opened Ocean Casino Resort, located on the Atlantic\\nCity Boardwalk. Ocean Walk obtained property insurance policies from defendants\\nAmerican Guarantee and Liability Insurance Company, AIG Specialty Insurance\\nCompany, and Interstate Fire & Casualty Company. Ocean Walk alleges that, in\\ncombination with a policy issued by a fourth insurer that is not part of this appeal,\\ndefendants’ policies obligated them to provide Ocean Walk up to $50,000,000 of\\nprimary policy limits per occurrence, in excess of any applicable deductible for the\\npolicy period.\\n\\n       The property insurance policies issued by defendants set forth identical base\\npolicy forms. Each policy provided that it insured “against direct physical loss of or\\ndamage caused by a Covered Cause of Loss to Covered Property, at an Insured\\nLocation,” subject to the terms, conditions, and exclusions stated in the policy. Each\\npolicy contained a “contamination exclusion” providing in part that -- “unless it\\nresults from direct physical loss or damage not excluded by this Policy” --\\n“Contamination, and any cost due to Contamination including the inability to use or\\noccupy property or any cost of making property safe or suitable for use or\\noccupancy” is excluded.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           1\\n       Ocean Walk closed its facilities in March 2020 and then reopened them in\\nJuly 2020, both in accordance with Executive Orders issued by Governor Philip D.\\nMurphy. Ocean Walk submitted a claim for coverage under the policies issued by\\ndefendants. When they denied coverage -- aside from agreeing to pay their\\nproportionate shares of a $1,000,000 sublimit under the policies’ Interruption by\\nCommunicable Disease amendatory endorsement -- Ocean Walk filed a complaint.\\nAll defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.\\n\\n       The trial court concluded that Ocean Walk had adequately pled facts\\nsupporting a finding of “direct physical loss” of or “direct physical . . . damage” to\\nits property because it had alleged that due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it was unable\\nto “operate its gaming floor and hotel rooms” or to “operate according to its\\nessential functions.” And, invoking Nav-Its, Inc. v. Selective Insurance Co. of\\nAmerica, \\n183 N.J. 110\\n, 118-24 (2005), the trial court found the contamination\\nexclusion inapplicable to the claims asserted in this matter. The Appellate Division\\nreversed the trial court’s denial of the motions to dismiss filed by defendants. The\\nCourt granted certification. \\n252 N.J. 606\\n (2023).\\n\\nHELD: Ocean Walk has not pled facts supporting a conclusion that its business\\nlosses were caused by a “direct physical loss” or “direct physical . . . damage” under\\nthe policy language. And even if Ocean Walk had pled facts supporting a finding of\\na covered “loss” or “damage,” the losses it alleges are excluded from coverage by\\nthe policies’ contamination exclusion.\\n\\n1. Upon reviewing relevant dictionary definitions and case law from other\\njurisdictions, the Court concludes that, to show a “direct physical loss” of its\\nproperty or “direct physical . . . damage” to its property under the policy language at\\nissue, Ocean Walk was required to demonstrate that its property was destroyed or\\naltered in a manner that rendered it unusable or uninhabitable. The policies’ “time\\nelement” provisions addressing business interruption underscore that interpretation\\nbecause those provisions would be meaningless if there has been no physical damage\\nto property that would require repairs, rebuilding, or replacement. (pp. 20-25)\\n\\n2. In its complaint, Ocean Walk defines the “direct physical loss” of its property\\nand the “direct physical . . . damage to its property” to be the “actual and/or\\nthreatened presence of Coronavirus particles” on its premises. It alleges that, in\\ncompliance with governmental directives, it was forced to close to the public in\\nMarch 2020 and that it reopened in July 2020 with restricted or limited operations.\\nBut those alleged facts do not support a finding of a “direct physical loss” of or\\n“direct physical . . . damage” to Ocean Walk’s property. Here, absent the executive\\norders, Ocean Walk would have been able to use its property for casino and other\\nentertainment functions with no suspension of its operations. The Court’s holding\\nthat Ocean Walk’s COVID-19 allegations do not satisfy the policy language\\n                                           2\\n comports with the vast majority of decisions by federal and state appellate courts\\nthat have addressed that issue. Ocean Walk did not allege facts supporting coverage\\nunder the policy language in dispute, and the deficiency in its allegations cannot be\\nremedied by discovery. (pp. 25-29)\\n\\n3. In support of its argument that the contamination exclusion in the policies issued\\nby defendants does not apply here, Ocean Walk notes that the policies’ definition of\\n“contaminant” does not include a “virus” or “pathogen or pathogenic organism.”\\nBut the definition of “contaminant” has no bearing on this appeal. The word\\n“contaminant” appears nowhere in the policies’ contamination exclusion. That\\nexclusion instead provides that, subject to an exception for radioactive\\ncontamination, the policies do not cover “[c]ontamination” and “any cost due to\\n[c]ontamination” -- including “the inability to use or occupy property or any cost of\\nmaking property safe or suitable for use or occupancy” -- unless the contamination\\n“results from direct physical loss or damage not excluded” by the policy. The\\npolicies define “contamination” to include “any condition of the property due to the\\nactual presence” of any “pathogen or pathogenic organism,” or “virus.” As Ocean\\nWalk alleges in its complaint, its claim arises from a “highly contagious and easily\\ntransmitted human pathogen.” The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Ocean Walk’s\\nfacilities falls squarely within the description of “contamination” in the policies.\\nThe Court explains why its decision in Nav-Its does not alter that conclusion.\\n(pp. 29-33)\\n\\n      AFFIRMED and REMANDED to the trial court.\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER\\nAPTER, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE PATTERSON’s opinion.

It claimed\\n\\nthat by virtue of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in its facilities and its\\n\\n\\n                                        3\\n government-mandated temporary suspension of operations, it had sustained a\\n\\n“direct physical loss” of or “direct physical . . . damage” to its property as\\n\\nthose terms are used in the insurance policies issued by defendants. Ocean\\n\\nWalk also argued that an exclusion in the policies for certain claims based on\\n\\n“contamination” did not bar its coverage claims. It contended that it was\\n\\ntherefore entitled to up to $50,000,000 in coverage under the policies.\\n\\n      The insurers denied coverage under the provisions of the policies, except\\n\\nfor coverage under an endorsement subject to a $1,000,000 sublimit. Ocean\\n\\nWalk filed an action for a declaratory judgment, damages, and other relief.\\n\\n      The trial court denied motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim filed\\n\\nby three of the insurers. The court concluded (1) that Ocean Walk’s alleged\\n\\nbusiness losses constituted a “direct physical loss” of or “direct physical . . .\\n\\ndamage” to its property, and (2) that those losses were not excluded from\\n\\ncoverage under the policies’ contamination exclusion. The Appellate Division\\n\\nreversed as to both determinations.\\n\\n      We concur with the Appellate Division that Ocean Walk has not pled\\n\\nfacts supporting a conclusion that its business losses were caused by a “direct\\n\\nphysical loss” or “direct physical . . . damage” under the policy language. We\\n\\nfurther agree with the appellate court that even if Ocean Walk had pled facts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         4\\n supporting a finding of a covered “loss” or “damage,” the losses it alleges are\\n\\nexcluded from coverage by the policies’ contamination exclusion.\\n\\n      Accordingly, we affirm the Appellate Division’s judgment reversing the\\n\\ntrial court’s denial of the defendant insurers’ motions to dismiss.\\n\\n                                        I.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      On June 28, 2018, Ocean Walk opened Ocean Casino Resort, located on\\n\\nthe Atlantic City Boardwalk. The facility consisted of 138,000 square feet of\\n\\ncasino and gaming space, including the largest virtual gaming suite in the\\n\\nUnited States; hotel accommodations; bars; cafés; restaurants; a nightclub; a\\n\\nbeach club; meeting spaces; pools; spas; fitness centers; and a concert venue.\\n\\n      This appeal centers on three commercial insurance policies issued to\\n\\nOcean Walk: a policy issued by defendant American Guarantee and Liability\\n\\nInsurance Company (AGLIC); a policy issued by defendant AIG Specialty\\n\\nInsurance Company (AIG); and a policy issued by defendant Interstate Fire &\\n\\nCasualty Company (IFCC). Ocean Walk alleges that, in combination with a\\n\\npolicy issued by defendant National Fire & Marine Insurance Company\\n\\n(NFMIC), the AGLIC, AIG, and IFCC policies obligated the insurers to\\n\\nprovide Ocean Walk up to $50,000,000 of primary policy limits per\\n\\noccurrence, in excess of any applicable deductible for the policy period.\\n\\n                                        5\\n       The property insurance policies issued by AGLIC, AIG, and IFCC set\\n\\nforth identical base policy forms. Each policy provided that it insured “against\\n\\ndirect physical loss of or damage caused by a Covered Cause of Loss to\\n\\nCovered Property, at an Insured Location,” subject to the terms, conditions,\\n\\nand exclusions stated in the policy. Each policy defined a “Covered Cause of\\n\\nLoss” to denote “[a]ll risks of direct physical loss of or damage from any cause\\n\\nunless excluded.” Each policy defined “Covered Property” to include, among\\n\\nother categories of property, the insured’s interest in “buildings (or structures)\\n\\nincluding new construction, additions, alterations, and repairs that the\\n\\n[i]nsured owns, occupies, leases or rents,” as well as the insured’s “interest in\\n\\nPersonal Property, including Improvements and Betterments.”\\n\\n      The policies issued by AGLIC, AIG, and IFCC contained an\\n\\n“Interruption by Communicable Disease” amendatory endorsement. Subject to\\n\\na $1,000,000 sublimit, each insurer’s amendatory endorsement provided in part\\n\\nthat the insurer\\n\\n             will pay for the actual Gross Earnings loss sustained by\\n             the Insured, as provided by this Policy, resulting from\\n             the necessary Suspension of the Insured’s business\\n             activities at an Insured Location if the Suspension is\\n             caused by order of an authorized governmental agency\\n             enforcing any law or ordinance regulating\\n             communicable diseases and that such portions of the\\n             location are declared uninhabitable due to the threat of\\n             the spread of communicable disease, prohibiting access\\n             to those portions of the Location.\\n                                         6\\n       Each policy contained a “contamination exclusion” providing in part that\\n\\n            [t]his Policy excludes the following unless it results\\n            from direct physical loss or damage not excluded by\\n            this Policy:\\n\\n                  Contamination, and any cost due to\\n                  Contamination including the inability to use or\\n                  occupy property or any cost of making property\\n                  safe or suitable for use or occupancy, except as\\n                  provided by the Radioactive Contamination\\n                  Coverage of this Policy . . . .\\n\\n      The policies defined “contamination” as “[a]ny condition of [the]\\n\\nproperty due to the actual presence of any foreign substance, impurity,\\n\\npollutant, hazardous material, poison, toxin, pathogen or pathogenic organism,\\n\\nbacteria, virus, disease causing or illness causing agent, Fungus, mold or\\n\\nmildew.”\\n\\n      The insurance policies issued by AGLIC, AIG, and IFCC were in effect\\n\\nbetween January 4, 2020 and January 4, 2021.\\n\\n                                       B.\\n\\n      On March 9, 2020, Governor Philip D. Murphy issued Executive Order\\n\\n103. The Executive Order identified COVID-19 as a “contagious, and at times\\n\\nfatal, respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.” The order\\n\\nacknowledged the rapid growth of the COVID-19 pandemic and the\\n\\noccurrence of confirmed cases in New Jersey and nearby states, and declared\\n\\nthat “a Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency exist in the State of\\n                                       7\\n New Jersey.” Exec. Order No. 103 (Mar. 9, 2020), https://nj.gov/infobank/\\n\\neo/056murphy/pdf/EO-103.pdf.\\n\\n      On March 16, 2020, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order 104,\\n\\nwhich, among other provisions, ordered that “casino gaming floors, including\\n\\nretail sports wagering lounges, and casino concert and entertainment venues”\\n\\nbe closed to the public “for as long as this Order remains in effect.” Exec.\\n\\nOrder No. 104 (Mar. 16, 2020), https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-\\n\\n104.pdf.\\n\\n      Five days later, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order 107, which\\n\\nsuperseded Executive Order 104’s operative paragraphs and closed to the\\n\\npublic “[a]ll recreational and entertainment businesses.” One category of\\n\\nbusinesses closed was “[c]asino gaming floors, including retail sports\\n\\nwagering lounges, and casino concert and entertainment venues.” Exec.

That order authorized the limited reopening\\n\\nof enumerated categories of recreational entertainment businesses, subject to\\n\\n                                       8\\n mandated precautions to minimize the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Exec.\\n\\nOrder No. 157 (June 26, 2020), https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-\\n\\n157.pdf. According to its complaint, Ocean Walk reopened its operations on\\n\\nJuly 2, 2020, in accordance with Executive Order 157.\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      On March 23, 2020, Ocean Walk submitted a claim for coverage under\\n\\nthe policies issued by AGLIC, AIG, IFCC, and NFMIC. Defendants’ adjuster\\n\\nissued a reservation of rights pending the insurers’ investigation. After\\n\\nadditional correspondence between Ocean Walk and its insurers, AGLIC, AIG,\\n\\nand IFCC agreed to pay $850,000, representing their collective proportionate\\n\\nshare of the $1,000,000 sublimit under the Interruption by Communicable\\n\\nDisease amendatory endorsement. The four insurers continued to reserve their\\n\\nrights under other provisions of the policies that Ocean Walk invoked.\\n\\n      On February 24, 2021, AGLIC, AIG, IFCC, and NFMIC denied\\n\\ncoverage to Ocean Walk under the remaining provisions.\\n\\n                                        II.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      Ocean Walk filed a complaint against AGLIC, AIG, IFCC, and NFMIC.\\n\\nAmong other assertions, Ocean Walk alleged that commencing on March 16,\\n\\n2020, it suffered “the physical loss of use of its property” and a “loss of\\n\\n                                        9\\n business revenue” by virtue of “the risks associated with the Coronavirus\\n\\npandemic, including direct physical loss of or damage to covered property, and\\n\\nin compliance with government guidance and orders.” Ocean Walk sought a\\n\\ndeclaratory judgment, compensatory damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, and\\n\\ncosts.\\n\\n         Pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e), all defendants moved to dismiss Ocean\\n\\nWalk’s complaint for failure to state a claim. AGLIC, AIG, and IFCC argued\\n\\nthat absent actual physical damage attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic,\\n\\nOcean Walk could not establish that it had sustained a “direct physical loss” of\\n\\nor “direct physical . . . damage” to the property. Defendants further asserted\\n\\nthat even if Ocean Walk had sufficiently pled such loss of or damage to its\\n\\nproperty, each policy’s contamination exclusion would bar coverage. NFMIC\\n\\nmade similar arguments and also relied on a provision that appeared in its\\n\\npolicy but not in the other insurers’ policies: an exclusion for certain losses\\n\\ncaused by “any pathogenic or poisonous biological . . . substance.”\\n\\n         The trial court found the phrase “direct physical loss of or damage\\n\\ncaused by a Covered Cause of Loss to Covered Property, at an Insured\\n\\nLocation” to be ambiguous. Relying on the Third Circuit’s decision in Port\\n\\nAuthority of New York & New Jersey v. Affiliated FM Insurance Co., \\n311\\n\\nF.3d 226\\n, 235-36 (3d Cir. 2002), and the Appellate Division’s decisions in\\n\\n                                         10\\n Wakefern Food Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co., \\n406 N.J. Super.\\n\\n524\\n, 529-41 (App. Div. 2009), and Customized Distribution Services v. Zurich\\n\\nInsurance Co., \\n373 N.J. Super. 480\\n, 483-88 (App. Div. 2004), the trial court\\n\\nconstrued the policies to provide coverage “if the property becomes unusable\\n\\nfor its intended purpose, whether or not the property is altered” by the SARS-\\n\\nCoV-2 virus. The court concluded that Ocean Walk had adequately pled facts\\n\\nsupporting a finding of “direct physical loss” of or “direct physical . . .\\n\\ndamage” to its property because it had alleged that due to the SARS-CoV-2\\n\\nvirus, it was unable to “operate its gaming floor and hotel rooms” or to\\n\\n“operate according to its essential functions.”\\n\\n      Invoking our decision in Nav-Its, Inc. v. Selective Insurance Co. of\\n\\nAmerica, \\n183 N.J. 110\\n, 118-24 (2005), the trial court ruled that the\\n\\ncontamination exclusion in the policies constituted a “pollution exclusion[]”\\n\\nthat should be viewed as “substantially directed at traditional environmental\\n\\nand industrial damages.” The court found the contamination exclusion\\n\\ninapplicable to the claims asserted in this matter.\\n\\n      The trial court accordingly concluded that Ocean Walk had sufficiently\\n\\npled facts supporting coverage under the policies issued by AGLIC, AIG, and\\n\\nIFCC, and denied those insurers’ motions to dismiss. It granted NFMIC’s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        11\\n motion to dismiss, based solely on the endorsement in NFMIC’s policy\\n\\nregarding “any pathogenic or poisonous biological . . . substance.”\\n\\n                                          B.\\n\\n      AGLIC, AIG, and IFCC appealed the trial court’s decision denying their\\n\\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e).1 The Appellate Division granted\\n\\namicus curiae status to the Insurance Council of New Jersey and American\\n\\nProperty Casualty Insurance Association, jointly represented, and to United\\n\\nPolicyholders.\\n\\n      In an unpublished decision, the Appellate Division reversed the trial\\n\\ncourt’s denial of the motions to dismiss filed by AGLIC, AIG, and IFCC.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division found that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in\\n\\nOcean Walk’s facilities and the government-mandated closure of those\\n\\nfacilities did not give rise to a “direct physical loss” of or “direct physical . . .\\n\\ndamage” to the property as the policies required. The appellate court\\n\\nconcluded that Ocean Walk had not pled that it suffered damage to its\\n\\nequipment or property that caused the property to lose its physical capacity to\\n\\noperate. It determined that Ocean Walk failed to allege a physical alteration to\\n\\nits property that rendered the property too dangerous to enter.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Ocean Walk did not appeal the trial court’s grant of NFMIC’s motion to\\ndismiss.\\n                                      12\\n       The Appellate Division held that instead, it was Governor Murphy’s\\n\\nexecutive orders that required Ocean Walk to close its gaming floor, sports\\n\\nwagering lounges, and entertainment venues. It noted that Ocean Walk had\\n\\nmaintained limited operations in some of its facilities as the government orders\\n\\npermitted and found that, absent those orders, Ocean Walk would have been\\n\\nable to continue operating its casino and other facilities. Viewing Ocean\\n\\nWalk’s claims to turn entirely on the language of the insurance policies, the\\n\\nappellate court held that further discovery could not render those claims\\n\\nviable. The Appellate Division held that even if Ocean Walk had sufficiently\\n\\npled that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had caused an actual or imminent physical\\n\\nloss or damage to its property, the contamination exclusion in each policy\\n\\nwould bar coverage.\\n\\n      Finally, the appellate court adopted the detailed reasoning and holdings\\n\\nin its decision affirming the dismissal of similar coverage claims in Mac\\n\\nProperty Group LLC v. Selective Fire & Casualty Insurance Co., \\n473 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 1\\n, 19-27 (App. Div. 2022).\\n\\n      The Appellate Division remanded the matter to the trial court for the\\n\\nentry of an order dismissing Ocean Walk’s complaint as to all defendants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       13\\n                                            C.\\n\\n      We granted Ocean Walk’s petition for certification. \\n252 N.J. 606\\n\\n\\n(2023). We maintained the amicus curiae status of the Insurance Council of\\n\\nNew Jersey, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, and\\n\\nUnited Policyholders. We also granted the amicus curiae applications of the\\n\\nNational Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the Restaurant Law\\n\\nCenter, the Medical Society of New Jersey, and the New Jersey Association\\n\\nfor Justice.\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n                                           A.\\n\\n      Ocean Walk urges that we reverse the Appellate Division’s\\n\\ndetermination. It argues that it pled sufficient facts to support its contention\\n\\nthat the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused “direct physical loss” of property or “direct\\n\\nphysical . . . damage” to property, noting that the trial court properly denied\\n\\ndefendants’ motions to dismiss. Ocean Walk contends that the contamination\\n\\nexclusion constitutes a pollution exclusion limited to environmental claims,\\n\\nand is thus inapplicable to this appeal.\\n\\n                                           B.\\n\\n      AGLIC, AIG, and IFCC argue that the Appellate Division’s decision\\n\\nwas correct and should be affirmed.

In Wilson v. USI\\n\\nInsurance Service LLC, the Third Circuit defined the policy language “direct\\n\\nphysical loss . . . of property” to mean “a failure to maintain tangible\\n\\npossession of the structure.” \\n57 F.4th 131\\n, 142 (3d Cir. 2023). In Mac\\n\\nProperty, the Appellate Division found that the policy required the insureds to\\n\\nprove that their properties were rendered physically incapable of operating or\\n\\ntoo dangerous to enter. 473 N.J. Super. at 23.\\n\\n      As the Third Circuit explained in the asbestos setting of Port Authority,\\n\\n            [w]hen the presence of large quantities of asbestos in\\n            the air of a building is such as to make the structure\\n            uninhabitable and unusable, then there has been a\\n            distinct loss to its owner. However, if asbestos is\\n            present in components of a structure, but is not in such\\n            form or quantity as to make the building unusable, the\\n            owner has not suffered a loss.\\n\\n            [311 F.3d at 236.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        21\\n       Several federal and state courts have similarly construed a “direct\\n\\nphysical loss” of property. See, e.g., Sandy Point Dental, P.C. v. Cincinnati\\n\\nIns. Co., \\n20 F.4th 327\\n, 337 (7th Cir. 2021) (stating that “direct physical loss”\\n\\nrequires a “physical alteration to property” or “an access- or use-deprivation so\\n\\nsubstantial as to constitute a physical dispossession”); Goodwill Indus. of\\n\\nCent. Okla., Inc. v. Phila. Indem. Ins. Co., \\n21 F.4th 704\\n, 710 (10th Cir. 2021)\\n\\n(holding that “a ‘direct physical loss’ requires an immediate and perceptible\\n\\ndestruction or deprivation of property”); Conn.

[p]roperty’ clearly and unambiguously means that\\n\\nthere must be some physical, tangible alteration to or deprivation of the\\n\\nproperty that renders it physically unusable or inaccessible.” (alterations in\\n\\noriginal)).\\n\\n      The policy term “direct physical . . . damage” to property denotes “a\\n\\ndistinct, demonstrable, and physical alteration of [the property’s] structure”\\n\\nthat renders the property useless or uninhabitable. Wilson, 57 F.4th at 142-43\\n\\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Port Auth., 311 F.3d at 235); see\\n\\nalso 10012 Holdings, Inc. v. Sentinel Ins. Co., \\n21 F.4th 216\\n, 220-22 (2d Cir.\\n\\n2021) (stating that “‘physical damage . . .’ do[es] not extend to mere loss of\\n\\nuse of a premises, where there has been no physical damage to such premises,”\\n\\n                                        22\\n and that the term “instead require[s] actual physical loss of or damage to the\\n\\ninsured’s property”). “Direct physical . . . damage” to property is thus held to\\n\\nrequire a physical change to the property, not simply the temporary\\n\\nunavailability of the property to serve its intended purpose.\\n\\n      Several federal and state courts have accordingly construed the policy\\n\\nlanguage “direct physical loss” of property or “direct physical . . . damage” to\\n\\nproperty to denote either the property’s destruction or its alteration rendering it\\n\\nunusable or uninhabitable, and have declined to extend that language beyond\\n\\nthose parameters.

It\\n\\nalleges that “in or around March 16, 2020, and in compliance with\\n\\ngovernmental directives,” it was “forced to close to the public because of the\\n\\nlocal and nationwide risks and effects of the Coronavirus pandemic.” Ocean\\n\\nWalk acknowledges that it maintained limited operations in some of its\\n\\nphysical facilities and continued to conduct its online gambling business, as\\n\\npermitted under the executive orders. It states that “on July 2, 2020, in\\n\\ncompliance with [Executive Order] 157, Ocean Casino Resort reopened for\\n\\n                                         25\\n business” but that its operations “continued to be restricted or limited by the\\n\\nrisks associated with the Coronavirus pandemic as well as the related\\n\\ngovernmental directives,” including a continued ban on indoor dining and\\n\\ndrinking.\\n\\n      Assuming Ocean Walk’s factual allegations to be true in accordance\\n\\nwith Printing Mart, \\n116 N.J. at 746\\n, Ocean Walk has not alleged facts that\\n\\nwould support a finding of a “direct physical loss” of its property or “direct\\n\\nphysical . . . damage” to its property. At most, it has alleged that it sustained a\\n\\nloss of business during the COVID-19 government-mandated suspension of\\n\\nbusiness operations because it was not permitted to use its property as it would\\n\\notherwise have done.2 As the Third Circuit observed with respect to the\\n\\ncomplaint dismissed in Wilson -- in which the plaintiff businesses “lost the\\n\\n\\n2\\n   Ocean Walk invokes Wakefern, 406 N.J. Super. at 529 and Customized\\nDistribution, \\n373 N.J. Super. at 483-88\\n, for the proposition that it sustained a\\n“direct physical loss” or “direct physical . . . damage” because its property\\ncould not be used for its essential function while the government suspension\\norders were in effect. Its reliance on those decisions is misplaced. In\\nWakefern, the insurance policy at issue covered “consequential loss or damage\\nresulting from interruption of . . . [p]ower” resulting “[f]rom physical damage\\nby a peril insured against.” 406 N.J. Super. at 531. The insured’s losses fit\\nexactly within that provision, and the Appellate Division expressly stated that\\nit would “reach a different result if, for example, a governmental agency had\\nordered that the power be shut off to conserve electricity.” Id. at 531-32; 540\\nn.7. Customized Distribution involved a third-party liability insurance policy\\nissued to a warehouse operator that allegedly mishandled a manufacturer’s\\nproducts, rendering them unsuitable for sale. \\n373 N.J. Super. at 490-91\\n.\\nNeither decision addressed a setting comparable to the circumstances here.\\n                                         26\\n ability to use their properties for their intended business purposes” by virtue of\\n\\ngovernment orders -- such an allegation “is completely divorced from the\\n\\nphysical condition of the premises,” given that the properties were “intact and\\n\\nfunctional” and were “not destroyed in whole or in part.” 57 F.4th at 142-43.\\n\\nThe Appellate Division rebuffed a similar argument in Mac Property, noting\\n\\nthat the insured businesses “would have been able to continue functioning as a\\n\\ndine-in restaurant, bakery, childcare and learning center, or gym without\\n\\ninterruption had Governor Murphy not issued his [executive orders],” given\\n\\nthat none of the facilities needed repairs due to damage or required relocation.\\n\\n473 N.J. Super. at 23. Here, absent the executive orders, Ocean Walk would\\n\\nhave been able to use its property for casino and other entertainment functions\\n\\nwith no suspension of its operations.\\n\\n      Our holding that Ocean Walk’s COVID-19 allegations do not satisfy the\\n\\npolicy language comports with the vast majority of decisions by federal and\\n\\nstate appellate courts that have addressed that issue.

We agree with the Appellate Division that Ocean Walk did not\\n\\nallege facts supporting coverage under the policy language in dispute, and that\\n\\nthe deficiency in its allegations cannot be remedied by discovery.4\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      Although it is not strictly necessary given our conclusion that Ocean\\n\\nWalk did not allege facts to establish a “direct physical loss” of or “direct\\n\\nphysical . . . damage” to its property, we nonetheless briefly address Ocean\\n\\nWalk’s argument that the contamination exclusion in the policies issued by\\n\\nAGLIC, AIG, and IFCC does not apply here.\\n\\n      In support of that argument, Ocean Walk invokes the policies’ definition\\n\\nof the term “contaminant.” In the policies, “contaminant” is defined as “[a]ny\\n\\nsolid, liquid, gaseous, thermal or other irritant, pollutant or contaminant,\\n\\nincluding but not limited to smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis,\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  Although we affirm the Appellate Division’s analysis of the coverage\\nprovisions, we do not adopt its comment that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can easily\\nbe eliminated from surfaces by household cleaning. We make no\\ndetermination on that issue here.\\n                                     29\\n chemicals, waste . . . , asbestos, ammonia, other hazardous substances, Fungus\\n\\nor Spores.” Noting that the definition of “contaminant” does not include a\\n\\n“virus” or “pathogen or pathogenic organism,” Ocean Walk urges us to find\\n\\nthat the contamination exclusion does not apply to its coverage claim.\\n\\n      That argument is unpersuasive. The definition of “contaminant” has no\\n\\nbearing on this appeal. In the policies, the word “contaminant” is used only in\\n\\nprovisions not relevant here, such as a provision addressing coverage in certain\\n\\nsettings for “the reasonable and necessary cost for the cleanup, removal and\\n\\ndisposal of the actual not suspected presence of [c]ontaminant(s) from\\n\\nunininsured property.”\\n\\n      The word “contaminant” appears nowhere in the policies’ contamination\\n\\nexclusion. That exclusion instead provides that, subject to an exception for\\n\\n“radioactive contamination,” the policies do not cover “[c]ontamination” and\\n\\n“any cost due to [c]ontamination” -- including “the inability to use or occupy\\n\\nproperty or any cost of making property safe or suitable for use or occupancy”\\n\\n-- unless the contamination “results from direct physical loss or damage not\\n\\nexcluded” by the policy. 5 The policies define “contamination” to include “any\\n\\n\\n5\\n  We reject Ocean Walk’s contention that AGLIC’s “Amendatory\\nEndorsement -- Louisiana,” excluding from coverage “[c]ontamination or\\nasbestos, and any cost due to [c]ontamination or asbestos including the\\ninability to use or occupy property or any cost of making property safe or\\nsuitable for use or occupancy,” applies here. As the Appellate Division noted,\\n                                        30\\n condition of the property due to the actual presence” of any “pathogen or\\n\\npathogenic organism,” or “virus.” As Ocean Walk alleges in its complaint, its\\n\\nclaim arises from a “highly contagious and easily transmitted human\\n\\npathogen.” The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Ocean Walk’s facilities falls\\n\\nsquarely within the description of “contamination” in the policies.\\n\\n      Ocean Walk also asserts that the contamination exclusion should be read\\n\\nto exclude from coverage only environmental pollution risks, not the risk\\n\\npresented by a virus such as SARS-CoV-2. It relies on this Court’s decision in\\n\\nNav-Its, \\n183 N.J. at 118-24\\n, for the proposition that the contamination\\n\\nexclusion should be read as nothing more than a “pollution exclusion”\\n\\nirrelevant to its coverage claim.\\n\\n      That argument is similarly unpersuasive. Our decision in Nav-Its does\\n\\nnot govern this appeal.\\n\\n      First, the policy exclusion at issue in Nav-Its was exclusively a\\n\\n“pollution exclusion.” \\nId. at 115\\n. We determined that the provision disputed\\n\\nin Nav-Its was intended to create “a broad exclusion for traditional\\n\\nenvironmentally related damages,” \\nid. at 122-23\\n, but that it did not exclude\\n\\ncoverage for the specific claim at issue in that case, which was brought by an\\n\\n\\n\\nthe “Amendatory Endorsement -- Louisiana” is irrelevant to this appeal, which\\nsolely concerns property located in New Jersey.\\n                                      31\\n individual who alleged exposure to toxic fumes during a floor coating and\\n\\nsealant project conducted by the insured, \\nid. at 113-15\\n. Here, in contrast, the\\n\\ncontamination exclusion in the policies at issue bars coverage not only for\\n\\ncertain claims premised on loss or damage caused by a “pollutant” but also for\\n\\ncertain claims premised on loss or damage resulting from other causes. Those\\n\\ncauses include the presence of a “virus” or a “pathogen or pathogenic\\n\\norganism” on covered property. The exclusion’s terms do not support the\\n\\nlimited reading that Ocean Walk advocates.\\n\\n      Further, we found significant in Nav-Its that the defendant insurers and\\n\\ntheir representatives had assured New Jersey regulators, in seeking approval\\n\\nfor the pollution exclusion, that the exclusion would not operate as an absolute\\n\\nbar to coverage for an insured’s products and completed operations. \\nId. at 124\\n.\\n\\nIn holding the exclusion inapplicable, we expressly rejected the defendants’\\n\\nattempt to depart from those representations in denying the policyholder\\n\\ncoverage. See \\nibid.\\n Here, there is no analogous contention that insurance\\n\\nregulators were misled by the defendant insurers or their representatives about\\n\\nthe import of the contamination exclusion.\\n\\n      In sum, nothing in our decision in Nav-Its warrants the interpretation of\\n\\nthe contamination exclusion urged by Ocean Walk -- an interpretation contrary\\n\\nto the policies’ plain terms.\\n\\n                                       32\\n       Assuming the truth of Ocean Walk’s factual allegations in accordance\\n\\nwith Printing Mart, \\n116 N.J. at 746\\n, we conclude that those allegations fall\\n\\nsquarely within the contamination exclusion in defendants’ policies, and that\\n\\nthe exclusion bars coverage here.\\n\\n                                       V.\\n\\n      We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division and remand the matter\\n\\nto the trial court for entry of an order dismissing with prejudice Ocean Walk’s\\n\\ncomplaint.\\n\\n\\n\\n     CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PIERRE-LOUIS, WAINER\\nAPTER, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE PATTERSON’s opinion.\\nJUSTICES SOLOMON and FASCIALE did not participate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       33\\n '),\n",

Effective on\\nJuly 1, 2013, the New Jersey Medical and Health Sciences Restructuring Act\\ntransferred the rights to all of the centers of UMDNJ, other than University Hospital,\\nto Rutgers. The Legislature designated University Hospital to “be the principal\\nteaching hospital of New Jersey Medical School and New Jersey Dental School, and\\nany other Newark-based medical education program.”\\n\\n       In October 2019, University Hospital issued a Request for Proposal (RFP)\\nseeking “to enter a contract with one vendor to design, stock, staff and operate an\\non-site [p]harmacy at our Newark location.” University Hospital received\\nresponsive proposals from petitioner Sumukha LLC and three other bidders. When\\nthe Hospital awarded the contract to a different bidder, Sumukha challenged the\\ndecision. University Hospital’s hearing officer denied Sumukha’s protest, and\\nSumukha filed an appeal in the Appellate Division. While that was pending,\\nSumukha filed a second protest challenging the decision to change the pharmacy’s\\nplanned location. When University Hospital failed to respond to that second protest,\\nSumukha filed a second appeal in the Appellate Division.\\n\\n       The Appellate Division dismissed the appeal from Sumukha’s first protest in a\\npublished opinion, concluding that University Hospital’s determination was not\\ndirectly appealable to the Appellate Division. 474 N.J. Super. 630, 639-44 (App.\\nDiv. 2023). It later dismissed Sumukha’s second appeal. Both dismissals were\\nwithout prejudice to Sumukha’s right to file an action in the Law Division. The\\nCourt granted certification and consolidated the appeals. 254 N.J. 497 (2023).\\n                                          1\\n HELD: The Court finds no evidence in University Hospital’s enabling statute that\\nthe Legislature intended the Hospital to be a “state administrative agency” under\\nRule 2:2-3(a)(2). University Hospital’s decisions and actions may not be directly\\nappealed to the Appellate Division.\\n\\n1. Rule 2:2-3(a)(2) states in relevant part that “appeals may be taken to the\\nAppellate Division as of right . . . to review final decisions or actions of any state\\nadministrative agency or officer.” The Appellate Division’s authority to review a\\nstate administrative agency’s final decision or action is exclusive. (pp. 11-15)\\n\\n2. The plain language definitions of the words “state administrative agency”\\ncollectively convey that Rule 2:2-3(a)(2) does not apply to all public entities that are\\npart of state government, but instead addresses executive entities that implement or\\nadminister particular legislation or constitutional requirements on the government’s\\nbehalf. Under separation of powers principles, it is the Legislature, not the\\nExecutive Branch or the agency itself, that defines an administrative agency’s role.\\nThe New Jersey Constitution requires that “[a]ll executive and administrative offices\\n. . . be allocated by law among . . . twenty principal departments.” N.J. Const. art.\\nV, § 4, ¶ 1. If the Legislature has not allocated a state governmental entity to an\\nexecutive branch department, that entity cannot be a “state administrative agency”\\nunder Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). A state entity’s enabling statute provides other guidance for\\na court applying Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). The Legislature has, in some instances, expressly\\nconfirmed that all or certain actions by a particular agency are reviewable through\\ndirect appeal to the Appellate Division. In addition, an enabling statute may grant a\\nstate governmental entity rulemaking authority or the authority to adjudicate\\ncontested cases, powers typically exercised by administrative agencies. An enabling\\nstatute’s provisions regarding the purpose, structure, governance, and authority of a\\nstate governmental entity may also provide compelling evidence of legislative intent.\\n(pp. 15-21)\\n\\n3. Based on the plain language of Rule 2:2-3(a)(2), the Court adopts the following\\nstandard to guide a court determining whether a given state entity constitutes a “state\\nadministrative agency” whose final decisions and actions may be directly appealed\\nto the Appellate Division. First, informed by the entity’s enabling statute, the court\\nshould consider what the Legislature intended the state entity to be. If the entity is\\nnot a principal department of the Executive Branch or allocated by the Legislature to\\nbe within, or “in but not of,” such a department, then it cannot be a “state\\nadministrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). If the entity has been allocated to a\\nprincipal department of the Executive Branch, then statutory provisions addressing\\nthe entity’s composition, governance, financing, and degree of independence from\\nthat department are relevant to the inquiry. Second, again informed by the enabling\\nstatute, the court should consider what the Legislature intended and empowered the\\npublic entity to do. In order for a court conducting that inquiry to deem a public\\n                                            2\\n entity a “state administrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2), it must conclude that\\nthe Legislature intended that the entity administer or implement policy in one or\\nmore areas on behalf of state government. In addition, if the Legislature has\\nempowered the entity to promulgate rules or adjudicate contested cases -- authority\\ntypically exercised by administrative agencies -- such a provision is a strong\\nindication that the entity should be considered a “state administrative agency” for\\npurposes of Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). (pp. 21-23)\\n\\n4. The Court reviews in detail the text of the Restructuring Act, University\\nHospital’s enabling statute. The Legislature neither placed the Hospital in an\\nexecutive department nor declared it to be “in but not of” such a department, which\\nitself is sufficient to conclude that the Hospital is not a state administrative agency.\\nApplication of the practical test adopted in the Court’s opinion further supports that\\nconclusion. Considering, first, what the Legislature intended University Hospital to\\nbe, the Court notes that the Hospital has a significant degree of independence in its\\nmanagement and operations and that its structure and governance bear little\\nresemblance to those of a state administrative agency. The first factor in the test\\ntherefore supports the conclusion that the Hospital does not meet the requirements of\\nRule 2:2-3(a)(2). Turning to what the Legislature intended and empowered\\nUniversity Hospital to do, the Court notes that the Legislature did not charge the\\nHospital to implement or administer the State’s healthcare policies generally, or any\\naspect of those policies. Nor did it give the Hospital authority typically granted to\\nan administrative agency. Conversely, the Legislature granted the Hospital not only\\nsignificant operational independence, but also a unique power that it has not granted\\nto any state administrative agency -- the power to offer itself for sale. See N.J.S.A.\\n18A:64G-6.1d. In short, University Hospital is not a “state administrative agency”\\nunder Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). The Court affirms the dismissal of the appeals, without\\nprejudice to Sumukha’s right to file actions in the Law Division.

It awarded\\n\\nthe pharmacy contract to another bidder. University Hospital’s hearing officer\\n\\ndenied Sumukha’s protest of the Hospital’s decision. Sumukha filed a notice\\n\\nof appeal in the Appellate Division, seeking to challenge University Hospital’s\\n\\nfinal decision denying the contract protest. It later filed a second protest\\n\\nregarding the Hospital’s contract award, which University Hospital also\\n\\ndenied.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division dismissed Sumukha’s appeal of University\\n\\nHospital’s denial of Sumukha’s first protest.

The appellate court\\n\\nconcluded that the Legislature did not make University Hospital a state\\n\\nadministrative agency and dismissed the appeal without prejudice to\\n\\nSumukha’s right to bring an action in the Law Division challenging the\\n\\nHospital’s decision. Id. at 632-33. Sumukha also appealed University\\n\\nHospital’s denial of its second protest, and the Appellate Division dismissed\\n\\nwithout prejudice Sumukha’s second appeal.\\n\\n      We granted Sumukha’s petitions for certification. We find no evidence\\n\\nin University Hospital’s enabling statute that the Legislature intended the\\n\\nHospital to be a “state administrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2).

University Hospital is a teaching\\n\\nhospital located in Newark that delivers medical care, including acute care and\\n\\n                                       3\\n trauma services. From 1979 to 2013, it was the primary teaching hospital of\\n\\nthe University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey (UMDNJ).\\n\\n      On August 22, 2012, the Legislature passed the New Jersey Medical and\\n\\nHealth Sciences Restructuring Act (Restructuring Act). L. 2012, c. 45.\\n\\nEffective on July 1, 2013, the Restructuring Act transferred “the rights to all of\\n\\nthe schools, institutes, and centers” of UMDNJ, “other than . . . University\\n\\nHospital” to Rutgers, The State University. Id. § 3(a) (codified at N.J.S.A.\\n\\n18A:65-94(a)). The Legislature designated University Hospital to “be the\\n\\nprincipal teaching hospital of New Jersey Medical School and New Jersey\\n\\nDental School, and any other Newark-based medical education program.” Id.\\n\\n§ 14(a) (codified at N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1a(a)).\\n\\n      On October 25, 2019, University Hospital issued a Request for Proposal\\n\\n(RFP) seeking “to enter a contract with one vendor to design, stock, staff and\\n\\noperate an on-site [p]harmacy at our Newark location.” The RFP stated that\\n\\nthe proposed pharmacy would be constructed in the Hospital’s main lobby to\\n\\nserve “patients, employees and [the] public.” In its RFP, University Hospital\\n\\nadvised potential bidders that its Executive Director’s final decision\\n\\nconcerning all disputes about contract award rescission, contract interpretation,\\n\\ncontractor performance and/or reduction, suspension, or termination “shall be\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        4\\n deemed a final agency action reviewable by the Superior Court of New Jersey,\\n\\nAppellate Division.”\\n\\n      University Hospital received responsive proposals to the RFP from\\n\\nSumukha, Shields Pharmacy of University, LLC (Shields), and two other\\n\\nbidders. Its evaluation committee ranked Shields first with respect to the two\\n\\ncriteria that it used to compare the bids. On September 24, 2020, the\\n\\nHospital’s Board of Directors adopted a resolution awarding the pharmacy\\n\\ncontract to Shields.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n                                        1.\\n\\n      Sumukha protested University Hospital’s notice of intent to award the\\n\\ncontract to Shields, alleging that Shields had a conflict of interest, that Shields\\n\\nhad understated the labor costs of operating the pharmacy in its bid, and that\\n\\nthe Hospital’s analysis of the competing bids was predicated on\\n\\nmiscalculations.\\n\\n      In a final decision, University Hospital’s hearing officer denied\\n\\nSumukha’s protest. The hearing officer concluded that University Hospital\\n\\nwas not bound by statutes or regulations governing procurement and contract\\n\\nawards for state and local governmental entities, and that Sumukha had failed\\n\\nto provide any legal or equitable basis for the relief sought. The hearing\\n\\n                                         5\\n officer also denied Sumukha’s application for a stay of University Hospital’s\\n\\naward of the contract to Shields.\\n\\n      Sumukha filed a Notice of Appeal, contesting the hearing officer’s\\n\\ndenial of its first protest in the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division\\n\\ndenied Sumukha’s application for a stay and granted Shields’ motion to\\n\\nintervene. 1\\n\\n      Prior to oral argument in Sumukha’s first appeal, Sumukha filed a\\n\\nsecond protest in connection with University Hospital’s RFP. In that protest,\\n\\nSumukha objected to University Hospital’s decision, in consultation with\\n\\nShields after the contract was awarded, to change the location of the proposed\\n\\non-site pharmacy from the Hospital’s main lobby to an adjacent building.\\n\\nSumukha alleged that University Hospital improperly altered the pharmacy’s\\n\\nlocation after the award, and that its decision constituted further evidence of\\n\\nconflicts of interest and favoritism in the pharmacy project.\\n\\n      Sumukha advised University Hospital that if it did not respond to\\n\\nSumukha’s protest of the change in the pharmacy’s location, Sumukha would\\n\\ndeem that protest denied. University Hospital did not respond. Sumukha filed\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  After the Appellate Division granted Shields’ motion to intervene, Shields\\nappeared before the Appellate Division to address the merits of University\\nHospital’s decision awarding it the pharmacy contract. Before this Court,\\nShields took no position on the question raised by this appeal.\\n                                       6\\n a second appeal challenging the denial of its protest of the change in the\\n\\npharmacy’s location.\\n\\n                                         2.\\n\\n      In a published opinion addressing Sumukha’s first protest, the Appellate\\n\\nDivision noted that in the Restructuring Act, University Hospital’s enabling\\n\\nstatute, the Hospital was not allocated to an executive department in\\n\\naccordance with Article V, Section 4, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey\\n\\nConstitution, and that it does not meet the definition of a “state agency” or\\n\\n“agency” under N.J.S.A. 52:14B-2 for purposes of the Administrative\\n\\nProcedure Act (APA), N.J.S.A. 52:14B-1 to -31. In re Protest, 474 N.J. Super.\\n\\nat 639-41. The appellate court observed that in the Restructuring Act, the\\n\\nLegislature did not confer on University Hospital the authority to promulgate\\n\\nregulations or make quasi-judicial decisions, and that the Act did not provide\\n\\nthat the Hospital’s decisions would be reviewable as final agency decisions.\\n\\nId. at 641-42. The court also noted that the Act gave University Hospital a\\n\\ngreater degree of autonomy than is generally given to state administrative\\n\\nagencies. Id. at 642-43 (citing N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1d(a), -6.1(e)(7), -6.1e(a)\\n\\nand (b)). It found no support in the plain language of the Restructuring Act for\\n\\nSumukha’s argument that Hospital constitutes a “state administrative agency”\\n\\nunder Rule 2:2-3(a)(2).

Id. at 643-44. It did not decide whether\\n\\nUniversity Hospital must comply with state statutes and regulations governing\\n\\npublic procurement and contract awards, or otherwise address the merits of\\n\\nSumukha’s challenge to University Hospital’s award of the pharmacy contract\\n\\nto Shields. Ibid.\\n\\n      University Hospital then moved to dismiss Sumukha’s second appeal, in\\n\\nwhich Sumukha had challenged the denial of its protest of the Hospital’s post-\\n\\naward change in the location of the proposed pharmacy. The Appellate\\n\\nDivision dismissed that appeal without prejudice to Sumukha’s right to file an\\n\\naction in the Law Division regarding its second challenge.\\n\\n                                       3.\\n\\n      Sumukha filed petitions for certification in both appeals and moved to\\n\\nconsolidate the appeals. We granted both petitions and consolidated the\\n\\nappeals. 254 N.J. 497 (2023). We also granted the Attorney General’s\\n\\napplication to participate as amicus curiae.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        8\\n                                          II.\\n\\n                                         A.\\n\\n      Sumukha contends that a public entity should be deemed a “state\\n\\nadministrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2) if (1) its decisions or actions\\n\\nwould have been challenged by one of the traditional prerogative writs prior to\\n\\nthe 1947 New Jersey Constitution and (2) it is a “state” entity. Applying that\\n\\ntest, Sumukha contends that because public procurement challenges were\\n\\ntraditionally asserted by means of a writ of certiorari, and University Hospital\\n\\nconstitutes a state public entity, the Hospital is a “state administrative agency”\\n\\nwhose decisions are directly appealable to the Appellate Division.\\n\\n                                         B.\\n\\n      University Hospital proposes a different test to determine whether there\\n\\nis a right to direct appeal under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). It contends that such a\\n\\ndetermination requires the court to (1) consider what the state entity at issue is;\\n\\n(2) consider what that state entity does; and (3) find that a state entity is a\\n\\n“state administrative agency” only if the entity administers an aspect of\\n\\ngovernment on behalf of the sovereign. University Hospital argues that it does\\n\\nnot meet that standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         9\\n                                          C.\\n\\n      Amicus curiae the Attorney General views the Appellate Division’s\\n\\ndecision to comport with the plain language, structure, and purpose of Rule\\n\\n2:2-3(a)(2); to be consistent with this Court’s past application of the term\\n\\n“state administrative agency”; and to properly construe the Restructuring Act’s\\n\\nprovisions regarding University Hospital.\\n\\n                                       III.\\n\\n                                        A.\\n\\n      The New Jersey Constitution charges this Court to “make rules\\n\\ngoverning the administration of all courts in the State and, subject to the law,\\n\\nthe practice and procedure in all such courts.” N.J. Const. art. VI, § 2, ¶ 3.\\n\\n“Inherent in this Court’s ‘power to make rules concerning the administration,\\n\\npractice and procedure of the courts of this State’ is the broad power to\\n\\ninterpret court rules.” State v. Tier, 228 N.J. 555, 561 (2017) (quoting State v.\\n\\nLeonardis, 71 N.J. 85, 108-09 (1976)).\\n\\n      “Our review of the meaning or scope of a court rule is de novo; we do\\n\\nnot defer to the interpretations of the trial court or Appellate Division unless\\n\\nwe are persuaded by their reasoning.” Ibid. In that review, we apply\\n\\n“ordinary principles of statutory construction to interpret the court rules.”\\n\\nDiFiore v. Pezic, 254 N.J. 212, 228 (2023) (quoting State v.

The Constitution superseded\\n\\nthe traditional prerogative writs by which litigants had long challenged\\n\\ndecisions or actions -- the writs of certiorari, mandamus, quo warranto, and\\n\\nprohibition -- and provided that “in lieu thereof, review, hearing and relief\\n\\nshall be afforded in the Superior Court, on terms and in the manner provided\\n\\nby rules of the Supreme Court, as of right, except in criminal causes where\\n\\nsuch review shall be discretionary.” N.J. Const. art. VI, § 5, ¶ 4. The\\n\\nConstitution thus conferred on the Court the authority to allocate claims that\\n\\nhad previously been maintained by prerogative writ to a division of the\\n\\nSuperior Court for review. See ibid.\\n\\n      Shortly after the adoption of the 1947 Constitution, the Court\\n\\npromulgated a court rule that addressed, among other issues, challenges to\\n\\n                                        11\\n decisions or actions of state administrative agencies that had historically been\\n\\nasserted by writ of certiorari. As Justice Nathan Jacobs observed in the wake\\n\\nof the constitutional reform, “[u]nder the old practice review of determinations\\n\\nby State Administrative Agencies was generally by application for writ of\\n\\ncertiorari,” but a court rule “replaces this by providing that review of final\\n\\ndecisions of State Administrative Agencies shall be by appeal to the Appellate\\n\\nDivision.” Nathan L. Jacobs, Procedure in Lieu of Prerogative Writs, 2\\n\\nRutgers L. Rev. 34, 37 (Special Issue, 1948); see also Cent. R.R. Co. v. Dep’t\\n\\nof Pub. Utils., 7 N.J. 247, 258 (1951) (noting that the constitutional mandate of\\n\\nArticle VI, Section 5, Paragraph 4 of the New Jersey Constitution “was\\n\\ncomplied with, resulting in the adoption by this court of Rule 3:81 and\\n\\nsubsequent amendments thereto”).\\n\\n      The term at the center of this appeal, “state administrative agency,”\\n\\nappeared in the original version of the court rule. Effective on September 15,\\n\\n1948, Rule 3:81-8 provided that “[r]eview of the final decision or action of any\\n\\nState Administrative Agency shall be by appeal to the Appellate Division.”\\n\\nRule 4:88-8, which replaced Rule 3:81-8, included the same language. See R.\\n\\n4:88-8 (“Review of the final decision or action of any state administrative\\n\\nagency . . . shall be by appeal to the Appellate Division.”); Close v. Kordulak\\n\\nBros., 44 N.J. 589, 596 (1965) (noting that Rule 4:88-8 replaced Rule 3:81-8).\\n\\n                                        12\\n       Effective on September 5, 1972, the Court adopted Rule 2:2-3, which\\n\\naddresses appeals to the Appellate Division from final judgments, decisions,\\n\\nand actions. At issue is subsection (a), concerning appeals as of right, which\\n\\nstates that,\\n\\n               [e]xcept as otherwise provided by R. 2:2-1(a)(3) (final\\n               judgments appealable directly to the Supreme Court),\\n               and except for appeals from a denial by the State Police\\n               of an application to make a gun purchase under a\\n               previously issued gun purchaser card, which appeals\\n               shall be taken to the designated gun permit judge in the\\n               vicinage, appeals may be taken to the Appellate\\n               Division as of right\\n\\n                     (1) from final judgments of the Superior Court\\n                     trial divisions, or the judges thereof sitting as\\n                     statutory agents; the Tax Court; and in summary\\n                     contempt proceedings in all trial courts except\\n                     municipal courts;\\n\\n                     (2) to review final decisions or actions of any\\n                     state administrative agency or officer, and to\\n                     review the validity of any rule promulgated by\\n                     such agency or officer excepting matters\\n                     prescribed by R. 8:2 (tax matters) and matters\\n                     governed by R. 4:74-8 (Wage Collection Section\\n                     appeals), except that review pursuant to this\\n                     subparagraph shall not be maintainable so long as\\n                     there is available a right of review before any\\n                     administrative agency or officer, unless the\\n                     interest of justice requires otherwise;\\n\\n                     (3) in such cases as are provided by law.\\n\\n               [R. 2:2-3(a) (emphases added).]\\n\\n\\n                                         13\\n       Rule 2:2-3, like its prior iterations, thus requires a court to determine\\n\\nwhether the state entity that issued the disputed decision or action is a “state\\n\\nadministrative agency.” If it is such an agency, the court must then consider\\n\\nwhether the decision or action of that agency is “final.” R. 2:2-3(a)(2); see\\n\\nalso In re CAFRA Permit No. 87-0959-5, 152 N.J. 287, 299 (1997) (discussing\\n\\ncriteria for assessing the finality of administrative action); D.J. Miller &\\n\\nAssocs. v. Dep’t of Treasury, 356 N.J. Super. 187, 191 (App. Div. 2002)\\n\\n(“[S]ome actions or inactions of State agencies and officers do not constitute\\n\\n‘administrative’ agency action or inaction that is subject to review by the\\n\\nAppellate Division under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2).”).\\n\\n      Under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2), the Appellate Division’s authority to review a\\n\\nstate administrative agency’s final decision or action is exclusive. Prado v.\\n\\nState, 186 N.J. 413, 422 (2006); Pascucci v. Vagott, 71 N.J. 40, 52 (1976).\\n\\nConsequently, an appeal of such a decision or action “must lie in the Appellate\\n\\nDivision unless the matter is a condemnation or inverse condemnation appeal\\n\\narising from state agency action and, therefore, [is] cognizable in the Law\\n\\nDivision in the first instance.” Infinity Broad. Corp. v. N.J. Meadowlands\\n\\nComm’n., 187 N.J. 212, 227 (2006). Nonetheless, “the Appellate Division\\n\\nretains the discretion, in an appropriate case, to retain jurisdiction in an appeal\\n\\nfrom the action of a state agency, but to refer the matter to the Law Division or\\n\\n                                        14\\n to the agency for such additional fact-finding as it deems necessary to a just\\n\\noutcome.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                       2.\\n\\n      When the Court adopted Rules 3:81-8, 4:88-8, and 2:2-3(a)(2), it chose\\n\\nthe term “state administrative agency” to describe a discrete category of\\n\\nentities whose final decisions and actions are subject to direct appellate review\\n\\nin the Appellate Division. That term is not identical to the term “state\\n\\nagency,” defined for purposes of the APA to include the principal executive\\n\\ndepartments “and all boards, divisions, commissions, agencies, departments,\\n\\ncouncils, authorities, offices or officers within any such departments now\\n\\nexisting or hereafter established and authorized by statute to make, adopt or\\n\\npromulgate rules or adjudicate contested cases, except the office of the\\n\\nGovernor.” N.J.S.A. 52:14B-2. It is also distinct from the terms “public\\n\\nagency” and “agency,” defined for purposes of the Open Public Records Act\\n\\n(OPRA), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 to -13, to include categories of public entities\\n\\nenumerated in OPRA’s definitional provision, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1. We thus\\n\\nconstrue a term distinct from those that have been defined by the Legislature.\\n\\n      To determine the meaning of “state administrative agency” within Rule\\n\\n2:2-3(a)(2), our inquiry begins with the Rule’s plain language. The word\\n\\n“agency” denotes “[a]n official body, esp. within the government, with the\\n\\n                                       15\\n authority to implement and administer particular legislation.” Black’s Law\\n\\nDictionary 77-78 (11th ed. 2019). A “state agency” is defined as “[a]n\\n\\nexecutive or regulatory body of a state.” Id. at 78. The word “administrative”\\n\\nmeans “[o]f, relating to, or involving the work of managing a company or\\n\\norganization.” Id. at 54. An “administrative action” is defined as “[a] decision\\n\\nor an implementation relating to the government’s executive function or a\\n\\nbusiness’s management.” Id. at 55. Those words collectively convey that\\n\\nRule 2:2-3(a)(2) does not apply to all public entities that are part of state\\n\\ngovernment, but instead addresses executive entities that implement or\\n\\nadminister particular legislation or constitutional requirements on the\\n\\ngovernment’s behalf.\\n\\n      Under separation of powers principles, it is the Legislature, not the\\n\\nExecutive Branch or the agency itself, that defines an administrative agency’s\\n\\nrole. As this Court recognized shortly after the adoption of the 1947\\n\\nConstitution, “the legislature may delegate to an administrative body the\\n\\nexercise of a limited portion of its legislative power with respect to some\\n\\nspecific subject matter,” but “such delegation of legislative power must always\\n\\nprescribe the standards that are to govern the administrative agency in the\\n\\nexercise of the powers thus delegated to it.” State v. Traffic Tel. Workers\\n\\nFed’n of N.J., 2 N.J. 335, 353 (1949).\\n\\n                                         16\\n       The New Jersey Constitution requires that “[a]ll executive and\\n\\nadministrative offices, departments, and instrumentalities of the State\\n\\ngovernment, including the offices of Secretary of State and Attorney General,\\n\\nand their respective functions, powers and duties . . . be allocated by law\\n\\namong and within not more than twenty principal departments.” N.J. Const.\\n\\nart. V, § 4, ¶ 1. As the Court has observed, that constitutional mandate is\\n\\nsatisfied “when the Legislature creates an agency and places it ‘in’ a\\n\\ndepartment of the Executive Branch,” or declares that agency to be “in but not\\n\\nof” such a department. In re Plan for Abolition of Council of Affordable\\n\\nHous., 214 N.J. 444, 462 (2013).\\n\\n      A provision in an enabling statute regarding the allocation of the state\\n\\nentity is therefore directly relevant to the procedure for an appeal. If the\\n\\nLegislature has not allocated a state governmental entity to an executive\\n\\nbranch department, that entity cannot be a “state administrative agency” under\\n\\nRule 2:2-3(a)(2). N.J. Const. art. V, § 4, ¶ 1; see also Vas v. Roberts, 418 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 509, 517 (App. Div. 2011) (rejecting the contention that the Legislature\\n\\nitself constitutes a “state administrative agency,” given that “agencies whose\\n\\nactions have been held to be reviewable in the first instance by the Appellate\\n\\nDivision are those located within the principal departments in the executive\\n\\nbranch of state government”).\\n\\n                                        17\\n       A state entity’s enabling statute provides other guidance for a court\\n\\napplying Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). The Legislature has, in some instances, expressly\\n\\nconfirmed that all or certain actions by a particular agency are reviewable\\n\\nthrough direct appeal to the Appellate Division. See, e.g., N.J.S.A. 10:5-21\\n\\n(final orders of the Director of the Division on Civil Rights); N.J.S.A. 39:10-\\n\\n20 (final determinations by the chief administrator of the Motor Vehicle\\n\\nCommission); N.J.S.A. 24:6I-7(e) (denials of permit applications by the\\n\\nCannabis Regulatory Commission); N.J.S.A. 13:20-26 (decisions or actions of\\n\\nthe Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council); N.J.S.A. 45:4B-5(f)\\n\\n(declaratory rulings of the Joint Committee of Architects and Engineers “shall\\n\\nbe deemed a final decision or action subject to review in the Appellate\\n\\nDivision of the Superior Court”); N.J.S.A. 49:5-17(a) (“Any person aggrieved\\n\\nby any act, determination, rule, regulation, or order or any other action of the\\n\\n[Chief of the Bureau of Securities] pursuant to [the New Jersey Corporation\\n\\nTakeover Bid Disclosure Law] may appeal to the Appellate Division of\\n\\nSuperior Court.”); N.J.S.A. 4:1-34 (persons or entities “aggrieved by any act,\\n\\nproceeding, rule, order, regulation, decision or determination of the director of\\n\\nthe Office of Milk Industry . . . shall be entitled to judicial review . . . in the\\n\\nAppellate Division”).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          18\\n       In addition, an enabling statute may grant a state governmental entity\\n\\nrulemaking authority or the authority to adjudicate contested cases, powers\\n\\ntypically exercised by administrative agencies. See, e.g., N.J.S.A. 5:12-\\n\\n107(a)(1) (providing that the Casino Control Commission “shall promulgate\\n\\nregulations for the conduct of hearings it is authorized to conduct” and shall\\n\\nrefer certain matters to the Office of Administrative Law); N.J.S.A. 11A:2-\\n\\n6(a), (d) (authorizing the Civil Service Commission to “render the final\\n\\nadministrative decision on appeals concerning permanent career service\\n\\nemployees or those in their working test period” and to “[a]dopt and enforce\\n\\nrules . . . to effectively implement a comprehensive personnel management\\n\\nsystem”); N.J.S.A. 18A:4-15 (stating that the State Board of Education “shall\\n\\nmake and enforce, and may alter and repeal, rules for its own government and\\n\\nfor implementing and carrying out the school laws of this state under which it\\n\\nhas jurisdiction”). Indeed, rulemaking authority was granted to UMDNJ itself\\n\\nprior to the Restructuring Act; under N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6(q) (2006), now\\n\\nrepealed, UMDNJ’s board of trustees had “the power and duty” to “[a]dopt\\n\\nbylaws and make and promulgate such rules, regulations and orders, not\\n\\ninconsistent with the provisions of this act as are necessary and proper for the\\n\\nadministration and operation of [UMDNJ] and to implement the provisions of\\n\\nthis act.”\\n\\n                                       19\\n       An enabling statute’s provisions regarding the purpose, structure,\\n\\ngovernance, and authority of a state governmental entity may also provide\\n\\ncompelling evidence of legislative intent. In Infinity Broadcasting, we\\n\\nconsidered the Meadowlands Commission a state administrative agency given\\n\\nthe enabling statute’s declarations that the Commission is “a political\\n\\nsubdivision of the State established as an instrumentality exercising public and\\n\\nessential governmental functions,” and that the exercise of the Commission’s\\n\\npowers “shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of\\n\\nthe State.” 187 N.J. at 222 n.2 (quoting N.J.S.A. 13:17-5). In Hartz Mountain\\n\\nIndustries, Inc. v. New Jersey Sports & Exposition Authority, the Appellate\\n\\nDivision concluded that the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, by\\n\\nvirtue of its enabling statute, had “indicia of a state agency,” including that the\\n\\nAuthority’s “legislative purpose is stated in terms of the development of sports\\n\\nand exposition and ancillary facilities throughout the State”; that it was\\n\\n“constituted as a body corporate and politic within the Department of\\n\\nCommunity Affairs” with a membership that included state officers serving as\\n\\nex officio members and gubernatorial appointees; and that “[i]ts permissible\\n\\nprojects include[d] a wide range of sport, entertainment, exposition,\\n\\neducational and related uses throughout the State.” 369 N.J. Super. 175, 187\\n\\n(App. Div. 2004) (citing N.J.S.A. 5:10-2, -4(a) and (b), -6(a)).\\n\\n                                        20\\n       Accordingly, courts applying Rule 2:2-3(a)(2) to state public entities\\n\\nshould refer to the entity’s enabling statute to determine the Legislature’s\\n\\nintent.\\n\\n                                        3.\\n\\n      Based on the plain language of Rule 2:2-3(a)(2), we adopt the following\\n\\nstandard to guide a court determining whether a given state entity constitutes a\\n\\n“state administrative agency” whose final decisions and actions may be\\n\\ndirectly appealed to the Appellate Division. 2\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  We do not agree with Sumukha’s argument, untethered to the language of\\nRule 2:2-3(a)(2), that any challenge to a state entity’s final decision or action\\nthat would have been asserted by prerogative writ prior to the 1947\\nConstitution may be brought by direct appeal to the Appellate Division under\\nRule 2:2-3(a)(2). Under pre-1947 New Jersey practice, the prerogative writs\\nwere invoked to contest a vast array of official decisions and actions, many of\\nwhich were issued by entities that did not constitute state administrative\\nagencies. See generally 19 N.J. Practice, Skills and Methods §§ 4:2 to 4:6, at\\n848-55 (rev. 3d ed. 2005). Even the traditional writ of certiorari, which\\nSumukha contends would have been the prerogative writ used before 1947 to\\nassert a claim analogous to its procurement challenge, was not confined to\\nsettings involving state administrative agencies. See McKenna v. N.J.\\nHighway Auth., 19 N.J. 270, 274-75 (1955) (noting that the writ of certiorari\\nwas “extensively used to review the validity of ordinances and of by-laws,\\nwhich are clearly merely legislative in character and to review various other\\nacts of officers, boards and tribunals where it is difficult to discover the\\njudicial nature of the proceedings held subject to the review” (internal\\nquotation and alterations omitted)); Application of LiVolsi, 85 N.J. 576, 594\\nn.18 (1981) (stating that the function of the writ of certiorari was to “review\\nthe actions of inferior tribunals such as administrative agencies” (citing\\nMcKenna, 19 N.J. at 274-75)). The historical use of a prerogative writ to\\n\\n                                       21\\n       First, informed by the entity’s enabling statute, the court should consider\\n\\nwhat the Legislature intended the state entity to be. If the entity is not a\\n\\nprincipal department of the Executive Branch or allocated by the Legislature to\\n\\nbe within, or “in but not of,” such a department, then it cannot be a “state\\n\\nadministrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). See N.J. Const. art. V, § 4,\\n\\n¶ 1; In re Plan for Abolition of Council of Affordable Hous., 214 N.J. at 462.\\n\\nIf the entity has been allocated to a principal department of the Executive\\n\\nBranch, then statutory provisions addressing the entity’s composition,\\n\\ngovernance, financing, and degree of independence from that department are\\n\\nrelevant to the inquiry. See Infinity Broad., 187 N.J. at 222-26; Hartz\\n\\nMountain, 369 N.J. Super. at 187; Cohen v. Bd of Trs., UMDNJ, 240 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. 188, 193 (Ch. Div. 1989).\\n\\n      Second, again informed by the enabling statute, the court should\\n\\nconsider what the Legislature intended and empowered the public entity to do.\\n\\n      In order for a court conducting that inquiry to deem a public entity a\\n\\n“state administrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2), it must conclude that the\\n\\nLegislature intended that the entity administer or implement policy in one or\\n\\nmore areas on behalf of state government. See Vas, 418 N.J. Super. at 516-17\\n\\n\\n\\nchallenge a category of governmental decisions does not resolve the issue\\nbefore the Court; instead, the plain language of Rule 2:2-3(a)(2) controls.\\n                                        22\\n (noting the importance of an entity’s authority to implement legislation in\\n\\ndetermining whether it is an administrative agency); Black’s Law Dictionary\\n\\n77-78 (11th ed. 2019) (defining an “agency” in part based on its role in\\n\\nimplementing and administering “particular legislation”). That requirement\\n\\ndistinguishes state administrative agencies from a broad range of entities that\\n\\nare charged to deliver important services to the public in furtherance of\\n\\nlegislative policy, but not to implement or administer such policy. In some\\n\\nsettings, provisions of the enabling statute defining the state governmental\\n\\nentity’s mission and powers reveal the Legislature’s intent to cede to that\\n\\nentity limited authority to implement a particular statute. In other cases, such\\n\\nprovisions signal an intent that the entity serve a purpose that is simply not\\n\\nadministrative.\\n\\n      In addition, if the Legislature has empowered the entity to promulgate\\n\\nrules or adjudicate contested cases -- authority typically exercised by\\n\\nadministrative agencies -- such a provision is a strong indication that the entity\\n\\nshould be considered a “state administrative agency” for purposes of Rule 2:2-\\n\\n3(a)(2).\\n\\n                                        C.\\n\\n      With those principles in mind, we consider the text of the Restructuring\\n\\nAct, University Hospital’s enabling statute.\\n\\n                                        23\\n                                         1.\\n\\n      In the Restructuring Act, the Legislature found “that the present\\n\\norganization of UMDNJ’s substantial assets is not the best structure to\\n\\nmaximize the effectiveness of the State’s investment in medical, dental,\\n\\nnursing and health sciences education, associated research and health care.”\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 18A:64M-2(t). It prescribed the purpose, governance, and funding of\\n\\nUniversity Hospital. N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1a to -6.1i.\\n\\n      The Act provides in part that\\n\\n            University Hospital shall be the principal teaching\\n            hospital of New Jersey Medical School and New Jersey\\n            Dental School, and any other Newark-based medical\\n            education program. University Hospital is hereby\\n            established as a body corporate and politic and shall be\\n            treated and accounted for as a separate non-profit legal\\n            entity from Rutgers, The State University, and its\\n            assets, liabilities, and funds shall not be consolidated or\\n            commingled with those of Rutgers, The State\\n            University. The exercise by University Hospital of the\\n            powers conferred by this act shall be deemed to be\\n            public and essential government functions necessary\\n            for the welfare and health of the State and the people of\\n            New Jersey and University Hospital shall be an\\n            instrumentality of the State.\\n\\n            [N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1a(a).]\\n\\n      The Legislature mandated that State funding of University Hospital “be\\n\\nsufficient to maintain the level of community services provided on the\\n\\neffective date of [the Restructuring Act] and to maintain University Hospital as\\n\\n                                        24\\n an acute care facility and trauma center.” N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1a(d). It\\n\\ncreated a thirteen-member board of directors, which operates the Hospital.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1(a). The Board exercises statutory authority in certain\\n\\npersonnel, contracting, funding, and grant matters, among others. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n18A:64G-6.1(e).\\n\\n      The Legislature granted to University Hospital authority that is\\n\\nextraordinary for a New Jersey public entity: subject to statutory\\n\\nrequirements, the Hospital has the power to offer itself for sale. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n18A:64G-6.1d. University Hospital must obtain approval from the Superior\\n\\nCourt of New Jersey and the Commissioner of Health and Senior Services\\n\\n“prior to entering into a transaction that results in the acquisition of the\\n\\nhospital,” and it must comply with provisions of other laws identified in the\\n\\nstatute. N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1d(a), (d), (e). In the event of a proposed sale of\\n\\nUniversity Hospital, “[t]he Attorney General, in consultation with the\\n\\nCommissioner of Health and Senior Services, shall adopt regulations pursuant\\n\\nto [the APA] to carry out the purposes of” the Restructuring Act’s provision\\n\\nauthorizing the Hospital’s sale. N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1d(b). The statute sets\\n\\nforth criteria to guide the Attorney General’s determination whether “the\\n\\nproposed acquisition is in the public interest, meaning that appropriate steps\\n\\nhave been taken to safeguard the value of the hospital’s public assets and to\\n\\n                                         25\\n ensure that any proceeds from the proposed acquisition are irrevocably\\n\\ndedicated for appropriate charitable health care purposes” as defined by the\\n\\nRestructuring Act. N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1d(c). If the statutory requirements\\n\\nare met, the Hospital may be sold. N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1d.\\n\\n      Even if it does not opt to be sold, University Hospital may enter into a\\n\\ncontract with a third-party nonprofit corporation to operate and manage the\\n\\nHospital, subject to statutory requirements including the Department of Health\\n\\nand Human Services’ approval of the management contract. N.J.S.A.\\n\\n18A:64G-6.1e. Under the Restructuring Act, a proposed management\\n\\nagreement between University Hospital and a nonprofit corporation is\\n\\nevaluated in part based on whether the Hospital, if managed by the nonprofit\\n\\ncorporation, “will continue its public mission and commitment to provide a\\n\\ncomprehensive healthcare program and services to the greater Newark\\n\\ncommunity, including acute care, and emergency and other essential services\\n\\nprovided by the hospital.” N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1e(a)(1). In the event that\\n\\nUniversity Hospital enters into a management contract with a nonprofit\\n\\ncorporation, such a contract “shall be liberally construed” to promote goals\\n\\nidentified by the Legislature. N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1i(a). The contracted\\n\\nmanager is afforded broad statutory authority, subject to the requirement that\\n\\nthe Hospital remain “the principal teaching hospital of the New Jersey Medical\\n\\n                                       26\\n School, the New Jersey Dental School, and any other Newark-based medical\\n\\neducation program,” as well as to mandates addressing faculty appointments\\n\\nand the status of bargaining unit employees. N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1i(b), (c).\\n\\n      Thus, the Legislature envisioned not only that University Hospital may\\n\\narrange to be sold to another entity in certain circumstances, but that it can\\n\\ncontract to be managed by a nonprofit entity subject to statutory constraints.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1d, -6.1e, -6.1i.\\n\\n                                        2.\\n\\n      Informed by those provisions of the Restructuring Act, we apply the\\n\\nstandard adopted in this opinion to determine whether University Hospital is a\\n\\n“state administrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). 3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Sumukha relies on a footnote in the procedural history of Shim v. Rutgers, in\\nwhich this Court commented that “an appeal from a final decision by Rutgers\\nin respect of a student’s domicile must lie in the Appellate Division pursuant\\nto R. 2:2-3(a)(2).” 191 N.J. 374, 383 n.4 (2007). Its reliance is misplaced.\\nThe action in Shim, an appeal of Rutgers’ denial of a student’s application for\\nin-state tuition, was filed in the Law Division. Id. at 383. Neither party\\nargued in any court that Rutgers’ determination should instead have been\\ndirectly appealed to the Appellate Division, and neither the Appellate Division\\nnor this Court vacated the Law Division’s judgment on the ground that it was\\nnot the proper venue for the dispute. See id. at 378-84; Shim v. Rutgers, 385\\nN.J. Super. 200, 205-08 (App. Div. 2007). The comment in the Court’s\\nrecitation of the procedural history was not part of the Court’s analysis and\\nwas not germane to its decision in that case. Accordingly, it constituted\\ndictum, not precedential authority. See State v. Rose, 206 N.J. 141, 183\\n(2011).\\n                                        27\\n       Although University Hospital is designated “a body corporate and\\n\\npolitic” and “an instrumentality of the State,” N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1a(a), the\\n\\nLegislature neither placed the Hospital in an executive department nor\\n\\ndeclared it to be “in but not of” such a department, which itself is sufficient to\\n\\nconclude that the Hospital is not a state administrative agency. See N.J. Const.\\n\\nart. V, § 4, ¶ 1; In re Plan for Abolition of Council of Affordable Hous., 214\\n\\nN.J. at 462. University Hospital, unallocated to a principal department of the\\n\\nExecutive Branch, does not meet the constitutional requirement for a state\\n\\nadministrative agency.\\n\\n      Application of the practical test adopted in this opinion further supports\\n\\nthat conclusion. Considering, first, what the Legislature intended University\\n\\nHospital to be, the Legislature clearly envisioned that University Hospital\\n\\nwould exercise a significant degree of independence in its management and\\n\\noperations. The Hospital’s board of directors exercises governing authority in\\n\\nseveral important respects, including certain personnel matters, contracting\\n\\nauthority, and control over its funds and grants. N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1e. In\\n\\naddition, the structure and governance that the Legislature prescribed for\\n\\nUniversity Hospital bears little resemblance to the structure and governance of\\n\\na state administrative agency. The first factor in the test therefore supports the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        28\\n conclusion that the Hospital does not meet the requirements of Rule 2:2-\\n\\n3(a)(2).\\n\\n      Next, we consider what the Legislature intended and empowered\\n\\nUniversity Hospital to do.\\n\\n      The Hospital’s mission is critical and clear: it exists “to provide a\\n\\ncomprehensive healthcare program and services to the greater Newark\\n\\ncommunity, including acute care, and emergency and other essential services\\n\\nprovided by the hospital,” N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1e(a)(1), and to serve as “the\\n\\nprincipal teaching hospital of New Jersey Medical School and New Jersey\\n\\nDental School, and any other Newark-based medical education program,”\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1a(a).\\n\\n      Notwithstanding the paramount importance of that mission to public\\n\\nhealth, the Legislature did not charge the Hospital to implement or administer\\n\\nthe State’s healthcare policies generally, or any aspect of those policies. See\\n\\ngenerally N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1a to -6.1i. Nor did it give the Hospital\\n\\nauthority typically granted to an administrative agency. Unlike UMDNJ as it\\n\\nwas constituted under prior law, University Hospital was not granted\\n\\nrulemaking authority. See generally N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1a to -6.1i. Nothing\\n\\nin the Restructuring Act gives the Hospital authority to adjudicate contested\\n\\ncases. Ibid. The comprehensive statutory scheme for the operation and\\n\\n                                       29\\n management of University Hospital reflects no legislative intent that the\\n\\nHospital conduct activities typical of an administrative agency. Ibid.\\n\\n       Conversely, the Legislature granted to University Hospital not only\\n\\nsignificant operational independence, but also a unique power that it has not\\n\\ngranted to any state administrative agency -- the power to offer itself for sale.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 18A:64G-6.1d.\\n\\n       In short, the Legislature’s provisions for University Hospital’s authority\\n\\nand mission strongly indicate that the Hospital is not a state administrative\\n\\nagency. The second factor weighs in favor of a conclusion that University\\n\\nHospital does not meet the standard of Rule 2:2-3(a)(2).\\n\\n       Accordingly, we hold that University Hospital is not a “state\\n\\nadministrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2). Under that Rule, Sumukha is\\n\\nnot permitted to appeal the Hospital’s decisions to the Appellate Division in\\n\\nthe first instance. 4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  University Hospital’s statement in its RFP that certain final decisions related\\nto the RFP would be deemed final agency actions reviewable by the Appellate\\nDivision was inaccurate. Clearly, a public entity that does not qualify as a\\n“state administrative agency” under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2) does not have the\\nauthority to declare itself to be such an agency. University Hospital and other\\npublic entities that are not state administrative agencies under Rule 2:2-3(a)(2)\\nshould avoid giving potential bidders in public procurement incorrect advice as\\nto the proper procedure to appeal their decisions.\\n                                         30\\n       We affirm the Appellate Division’s dismissal of the appeals, without\\n\\nprejudice to Sumukha’s right to file actions in the Law Division. We make no\\n\\ndetermination on the question whether University Hospital is subject to state\\n\\nprocurement laws, or on any other issue related to the merits of Sumukha’s\\n\\nchallenges to the Hospital’s decisions.\\n\\n                                      IV.\\n\\n      The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n      CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES SOLOMON, PIERRE-LOUIS,\\nWAINER APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join in JUSTICE PATTERSON’s\\nopinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          31\\n '),\n",

Carol Huff (A-42-22) (087900)\\n\\nArgued November 8, 2023 -- Decided May 30, 2024\\n\\nNORIEGA, J., writing for a unanimous Court.\\n\\n       In this appeal, the Court considers whether an indemnification clause in a\\ncondominium association’s bylaws applies to an indemnitee’s first-party claim for\\nattorneys’ fees and costs against the association.\\n\\n      Plaintiff Patrick Boyle owns one of the approximately 750 units of the Ocean\\nClub Condominium (OC Condominium). As a unit owner, Boyle is afforded\\nmembership in the Ocean Club Condominium Association, which oversees OC\\nCondominium affairs in accordance with the OC Condominium Master Deed and\\nBy-laws (bylaws). The Association is managed by a Board of Trustees (Board),\\ncomprised of seven members, who are all unit owners. Trustees are indemnified by\\nthe Association in accordance with Article VI, Section 1 of the bylaws.\\n\\n      Boyle was appointed to a seat on the Board. Following a bitter dispute\\nbetween Boyle and his fellow trustees over the financial management of the\\nAssociation, the Board adopted a special resolution to expel Boyle as a trustee.\\n\\n        Boyle filed a complaint challenging his removal. The trial court reinstated\\nhim as a trustee, holding that the Board violated the bylaws and relevant regulations\\nby failing to provide adequate notice of the vote to consider Boyle’s expulsion.\\nBoyle filed an amended complaint, adding additional claims including for\\nindemnification. He later filed a third amended complaint, bringing a derivative\\nclaim on behalf of the Association and alleging that the trustee defendants breached\\ntheir fiduciary duties; he sought indemnification for that claim as well.\\n\\n       Boyle was defeated in the next Board election, after which both sides moved\\nfor summary judgment. The trial court held in relevant part that the plain language\\nof the bylaws entitled Boyle to counsel fees and costs. The Appellate Division\\nfound that the indemnification provision covered the fees and costs Boyle incurred\\nin his action to be reinstated as trustee but not in his derivative action claim. The\\nCourt granted certification. 253 N.J. 589 (2023).\\n\\n\\n                                          1\\n HELD: The ambiguous indemnification provision at issue here must be construed\\nagainst the indemnitee, and the Court therefore reverses the Appellate Division’s\\njudgment. Prospectively, parties to a contract intending to extend indemnification to\\nfirst parties should include express language to achieve such an agreement.\\n\\n1. When the meaning of an indemnification clause is ambiguous, the provision is\\nstrictly construed against the indemnitee because (1) a party is ordinarily responsible\\nfor its own negligence, and shifting liability to an indemnitor must be accomplished\\nonly through express and unequivocal language, and (2) under the “American Rule,”\\nabsent statutory or judicial authority or express contractual language to the contrary,\\neach party is responsible for its own attorney’s fees. (p. 12)\\n\\n2. The Court reviews in detail the three-sentence indemnification provision in the\\nAssociation’s bylaws. The second sentence expressly provides that “[t]he\\nAssociation shall indemnify every Trustee . . . against all loss, costs and expenses,\\nincluding counsel fees, reasonably incurred by him in connection with any action,\\nsuit, or proceeding to which he may be a party by reason of his being or having been\\na Trustee,” absent willful misconduct or bad faith. Read in isolation, that sentence\\ncould support indemnification here, as Boyle argues and the Appellate Division\\nfound. But the interplay between the third sentence, in which the Association’s\\ncounsel must judge the indemnitee trustee’s behavior -- an assessment that would be\\nillogical if the second sentence were to extend indemnification to suits in which the\\nAssociation and the trustees were adverse -- and the first sentence, which provides\\nthat trustees “shall not be liable to the Unit Owners,” suggests that the reasonable\\ninterpretation of the second sentence is that the agreement was meant to cover any\\nand all actions by unit owners who bring actions against trustees in their capacity as\\ntrustees. At minimum, the indemnification provision is ambiguous and must\\ntherefore be construed against Boyle as the indemnitee. (pp. 13-17)\\n\\n3. Parties are free to determine whether to extend indemnification provisions to\\nfirst-party actions or limit them solely to third-party actions. Although the Court has\\nnever previously held that a contract should contain express language to permit\\nindemnification of first-party claims, its prior decisions support such a conclusion.\\nThe Court thus encourages parties seeking to permit indemnification of first-party\\nclaims to include express language to do so. Otherwise, any ambiguity will continue\\nto be construed against the indemnitee.

As part of his\\n\\ncomplaint, the trustee sought indemnification from the association for all\\n\\nattorneys’ fees and expenses arising from the litigation, relying on a provision\\n\\nof the bylaws under which trustees were declared not liable to unit owners and\\n\\nthe association was generally bound to indemnify trustees for legal expenses\\n\\nincurred due to their role as trustees. The trial court granted summary\\n\\njudgment and awarded the trustee the fees and expenses sought. The Appellate\\n\\nDivision affirmed the judgment but remanded the matter for reconsideration of\\n\\nthe ultimate amount of attorneys’ fees.\\n\\n      We hold that the ambiguous indemnification provision at issue here must\\n\\nbe construed against the indemnitee, and therefore reverse the Appellate\\n\\n\\n                                          2\\n Division’s judgment. Prospectively, parties to a contract intending to extend\\n\\nindemnification to first parties should include express language to achieve\\n\\nsuch an agreement.\\n\\n                                       I.\\n\\n                                      A.\\n\\n      We rely upon the following facts derived from plaintiff’s third amended\\n\\ncomplaint, filed in 2021.\\n\\n      Plaintiff Patrick Boyle owns one of the approximately 750 units of the\\n\\nOcean Club Condominium (OC Condominium), in Atlantic City, where he\\n\\nresides with his wife. As a unit owner, Boyle is afforded membership in the\\n\\nOcean Club Condominium Association (Association). The Association is a\\n\\nnon-profit corporation that oversees OC Condominium affairs in accordance\\n\\nwith the OC Condominium Master Deed and By-laws (bylaws). The\\n\\nAssociation is managed by a Board of Trustees (Board), comprised of seven\\n\\nmembers, who are all unit owners.\\n\\n      The bylaws provide for the terms of service, election, and removal of\\n\\ntrustees. Board members are elected by the Association members and serve\\n\\nfor two-year terms. They may be removed, with or without cause, by an\\n\\naffirmative vote of two-thirds of the Association members. Relevant here,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       3\\n trustees are indemnified by the Association in accordance with Article VI,\\n\\nSection 1 of the bylaws, which we review in detail below.\\n\\n      Boyle purchased a unit with his wife in 2017. In June 2018, the Board\\n\\ntemporarily appointed Boyle to fill a vacancy and later appointed him to a\\n\\nregular seat in August 2019. Boyle’s background and experience as an\\n\\naccountant led him to raise serious concerns regarding “errors and anomalies”\\n\\nhe discovered in the Association’s finances. A bitter dispute arose between\\n\\nBoyle and his fellow trustees over the financial management of the\\n\\nAssociation.\\n\\n      In response, on August 16, 2020, the Board adopted a special resolution\\n\\nto expel Boyle as a trustee. The Board’s resolution alleged that Boyle had\\n\\nengaged in various acts of misconduct, including “disrupting the 2019 election\\n\\n. . . [and the] assault, harassment, intimidation, and bullying of other board\\n\\nmembers.” After his expulsion, Boyle requested reinstatement, which the\\n\\nBoard refused.\\n\\n                                        B.\\n\\n      In October 2020, Boyle and his wife filed a complaint and order to show\\n\\ncause against the trustees who ousted him. Boyle’s original claim sought a\\n\\ndeclaratory judgment that his removal was improper, requested reinstatement,\\n\\nand alleged a violation of N.J.A.C. 5:26-8.11(b) on the ground that the Board\\n\\n                                        4\\n expelled him without offering Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Boyle\\n\\nalso sought to enjoin the Board from any further attempts to remove him\\n\\nwithout following proper procedures under the Administrative Code or bylaws.\\n\\nBoyle additionally alleged causes of action in tort, including defamation and a\\n\\nseparate claim of breach of fiduciary duty by defendants, brought derivatively\\n\\non behalf of OC Condominium.\\n\\n      The trial court granted Boyle’s preliminary relief and reinstated him as a\\n\\ntrustee on December 11, 2020, holding that the Board violated the bylaws and\\n\\nN.J.A.C. 5:26-8.12(a) and (d) because Boyle and other members were not\\n\\nprovided with adequate notice of the scheduled vote.\\n\\n      The trustees thereafter scheduled a special meeting on December 18,\\n\\n2020, for the sole purpose of voting on Boyle’s removal. Boyle filed an\\n\\namended complaint, adding claims for indemnification and an order to show\\n\\ncause relating to the scheduled meeting. After hearing arguments, the trial\\n\\ncourt entered an order enjoining the Board from holding a member vote to\\n\\nremove Boyle until after the parties submitted to ADR pursuant to N.J.A.C.\\n\\n5:26-8.11(b)(1). The parties agreed to arbitrate the Board’s right to remove\\n\\nBoyle.\\n\\n      In April 2021, Boyle filed a third amended complaint, bringing a\\n\\nderivative claim on behalf of the Association and alleging that the trustee\\n\\n                                       5\\n defendants breached their fiduciary duties. The complaint sought:\\n\\n(1) injunctive relief to reinstate Boyle as a trustee and to enjoin defendants\\n\\nfrom future attempts to remove Boyle from the Board; (2) reimbursement of\\n\\nBoyle’s fees and costs under the indemnification provisions of the bylaws; and\\n\\n(3) a declaration that Boyle’s removal from the Board was wrongful.\\n\\n      Arbitration was scheduled for July 26, 2021. Defendants abandoned\\n\\narbitration, hoping instead that Boyle would not be reelected in the board\\n\\nelection scheduled for August 2021. The parties withdrew the request to\\n\\nparticipate in arbitration and the trial court entered a consent order to that\\n\\neffect, noting that the parties reserved all other rights and defenses.\\n\\n      Boyle was defeated in the August 2021 election. He moved for\\n\\nsummary judgment on the counts for injunctive and declaratory relief and for\\n\\npartial summary judgment on the indemnification provision, claiming he was\\n\\nentitled to fees and costs pursuant to the bylaws. Defendants cross-moved for\\n\\nsummary judgment on all counts.\\n\\n      The trial court issued an order granting Boyle’s motion for summary\\n\\njudgment and denying defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment. As to\\n\\nindemnification, the trial court held that the plain language of the bylaws\\n\\nentitled Boyle to counsel fees and costs. The trial court found that Article VI\\n\\nof the bylaws did not limit indemnification to fees and costs incurred by a\\n\\n                                         6\\n trustee in an action brought by a third-party against the trustee, but also\\n\\nextended to first-party claims where the trustee was the plaintiff. It further\\n\\nheld that when defendants abandoned ADR, they waived their right to argue\\n\\nBoyle’s willful misconduct or bad faith exempted him from indemnification.\\n\\n      The court awarded Boyle legal fees and costs incurred in the amount of\\n\\n$516,811.80, to be paid within thirty days. Boyle moved for reconsideration\\n\\nof that calculation, and defendants simultaneously moved for a stay of the\\n\\npayment. The trial court did not schedule a hearing of the stay request until\\n\\nafter the thirty-day deadline, prompting defendants to move before the\\n\\nAppellate Division for leave to appeal and for a stay of that payment.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division granted defendants’ motion for a stay, and the\\n\\ntrial court granted the motion for reconsideration. The trial court awarded\\n\\nBoyle a final judgment of $563,031.80, based upon a clerical error the court\\n\\ndiscovered during its initial calculation. In its order, the trial court\\n\\nacknowledged the Appellate Division’s order staying the thirty-day payment\\n\\nrequirement. Defendants thereafter filed their notice of appeal from the final\\n\\njudgment and order entering summary judgment.\\n\\n      In an unpublished opinion deciding the consolidated appeals, the\\n\\nAppellate Division rejected defendants’ arguments regarding the interpretation\\n\\nof the indemnification provision. The court found that the indemnification\\n\\n                                          7\\n provision covered the fees and costs Boyle incurred in his action to be\\n\\nreinstated as trustee. The appellate court, however, reversed the actual fee\\n\\naward, finding that Boyle was not entitled to fees incurred in pursuing his\\n\\nderivative action claim.\\n\\n      The Appellate Division rejected defendants’ argument on several\\n\\ngrounds. First, using principles of contract interpretation, the court determined\\n\\nthat there was nothing ambiguous about the indemnification language.\\n\\nSecond, regarding whether indemnification provisions should apply to first-\\n\\nparty claims, the Appellate Division found that the subject provision contained\\n\\nno language precluding a suit involving one trustee against other trustees.\\n\\nThird, the appellate court determined that because defendants abandoned ADR,\\n\\nthey had waived the ability to argue that an exemption to the indemnification\\n\\nprovision resulting from Boyle engaging in misconduct or bad faith should\\n\\napply. Fourth, the court concluded that Boyle was not entitled to any fees\\n\\nincurred in prosecuting the derivative action claim because he was acting in a\\n\\ncapacity other than trustee for the Board for purposes of that claim. The\\n\\nAppellate Division affirmed the entry of summary judgment.\\n\\n      We granted defendants’ petition for certification on all issues. 253 N.J.\\n\\n589 (2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       8\\n                                        II.\\n\\n      Defendants argue that the Appellate Division’s judgment was based\\n\\nupon three fundamental errors. First, the court ignored the word “indemnify”\\n\\nin the opening clause of the indemnification provision and instead focused\\n\\nexclusively on the phrase “any action.” Second, the Appellate Division\\n\\ndisregarded the American Rule for attorneys’ fees by holding that fees\\n\\nincurred in enforcing a contractual indemnification agreement are recoverable,\\n\\neven in the absence of explicit language to that effect. Third, the Appellate\\n\\nDivision improperly found that the Association waived its ability to raise\\n\\ndefenses and exceptions to the indemnification agreement by foregoing ADR.\\n\\n      Boyle urges this Court to affirm the Appellate Division’s decision,\\n\\nwhich he claims rightly found that the indemnification provision covers “all\\n\\nloss, costs and expenses, including counsel fees.” Boyle also contends that no\\n\\nfactual disputes remained once defendants opted to abandon ADR, and that\\n\\ndefendants are therefore barred from raising any claims of willful misconduct\\n\\nor bad faith as exceptions to indemnification.\\n\\n                                      III.\\n\\n                                       A.\\n\\n      We review de novo the trial court’s order granting summary judgment\\n\\nand are guided by the same standards that governed its decision. Samolyk v.\\n\\n                                       9\\n Berthe, 251 N.J. 73, 78 (2022). That standard mandates that summary\\n\\njudgment be granted “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories\\n\\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\\n\\nno genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party\\n\\nis entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.” R. 4:46-2(c). “When no\\n\\nissue of fact exists, and only a question of law remains, this Court affords no\\n\\nspecial deference to the legal determinations of the trial court.” Templo\\n\\nFuente De Vida Corp. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, 224 N.J. 189,\\n\\n199 (2016). This appeal turns on the interpretation of Article VI, Section 1 of\\n\\nthe Association’s bylaws.\\n\\n      We interpret condominium association bylaws using the traditional\\n\\n“canons of contract construction,” Highland Lakes Country Club & Cmty.\\n\\nAss’n v. Franzino, 186 N.J. 99, 116 (2006), and contract interpretation is also\\n\\n“subject to de novo review by an appellate court,” Kieffer v. Best Buy, 205\\n\\nN.J. 213, 222 (2011). Thus, “[w]e accord no special deference to the trial\\n\\ncourt’s or Appellate Division’s interpretative analysis and ‘look at the contract\\n\\nwith fresh eyes.’” GMAC Mortg., LLC v. Willoughby, 230 N.J. 172, 183\\n\\n(2017) (quoting Kieffer, 205 N.J. at 223).\\n\\n      In that process, “[o]ur only charge is to give a faithful and logical\\n\\nreading to the words chosen by the parties to the agreement,” ibid., in order to\\n\\n                                        10\\n “discern and implement the intentions of the parties,” Quinn v. Quinn, 225\\n\\nN.J. 34, 45 (2016). To do that, we “read the document as a whole in a fair and\\n\\ncommon sense manner,” Hardy ex rel. Dowdell v. Abdul-Matin, 198 N.J. 95,\\n\\n103 (2009), mindful that “[d]isproportionate emphasis upon a word or clause\\n\\nor single provision does not serve the purpose of interpretation,” Republic\\n\\nBusiness Credit Corp. v. Camhe-Marcille, 381 N.J. Super. 563, 568-69 (App.\\n\\nDiv. 2005) (alteration in original) (quoting Newark Publishers’ Ass’n v.\\n\\nNewark Typographical Union, 22 N.J. 419, 426 (1956)). Accordingly,\\n\\n“[w]ords and phrases are not to be isolated but related to the context and the\\n\\ncontractual scheme as a whole, and given the meaning that comports with the\\n\\nprobable intent and purpose.” Id. at 569 (alteration in original) (quoting\\n\\nNewark Publishers’ Ass’n, 22 N.J. at 426).\\n\\n      To review an indemnity provision in a contract, we strive for the same\\n\\ngoal as we do in reviewing any contractual provision -- discerning the intent of\\n\\nthe parties. See Kieffer, 205 N.J. at 223. “The judicial task is simply\\n\\ninterpretative; it is not to rewrite a contract for the parties better than or\\n\\ndifferent from the one they wrote for themselves.” Ibid. The terms used in the\\n\\ncontract are given their plain and ordinary meaning, and “[i]f an indemnity\\n\\nprovision is unambiguous, then the words presumably will reflect the parties’\\n\\nexpectations.” Ibid.\\n\\n                                         11\\n       Indemnity provisions, however, differ from other contractual provisions\\n\\nin one important respect: when the meaning of the clause is ambiguous, an\\n\\nindemnification provision will be “strictly construed against the indemnitee.”\\n\\nId. at 223-24 (quoting Mantilla v. NC Mall Assocs., 167 N.J. 262, 272 (2001)).\\n\\nWe have previously acknowledged that this construction has “two apparent\\n\\nreasons.” Id. at 224. “One is that a party is ordinarily responsible for its own\\n\\nnegligence, and shifting liability to an indemnitor must be accomplished only\\n\\nthrough express and unequivocal language.” Ibid. The second is that “under\\n\\nthe American Rule, absent statutory or judicial authority or express contractual\\n\\nlanguage to the contrary, each party is responsible for its own attorney’s\\n\\nfees.” 1 Ibid. (emphasis added). Those two principles will help guide our\\n\\nanalysis below.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  New Jersey courts “have traditionally adhered to the American Rule as the\\nprinciple that governs the allocation of attorneys’ fees.” Occhifinto v. Olivo\\nConst. Co., LLC, 221 N.J. 443, 449 (2015) (quoting Walker v. Giuffre, 209\\nN.J. 124, 127 (2012)). At its essence, the American Rule requires that litigants\\n“bear the cost of their own legal representation” by prohibiting “‘recovery of\\ncounsel fees by the prevailing party against the losing party.’” Ibid. (quoting\\nIn re Est. of Vayda, 184 N.J. 115, 120 (2005)). The rule promotes three goals:\\n“(1) unrestricted access to the courts for all persons; (2) ensuring equity by not\\npenalizing persons for exercising their right to litigate a dispute, even if they\\nshould lose; and (3) administrative convenience.” In re Niles Tr., 176 N.J.\\n282, 294 (2003). Certain statutes and court rules create exceptions to the\\nAmerican Rule, and parties to a contract may provide for an award of\\nattorneys’ fees provided they do so through “express contractual language.”\\nKieffer, 205 N.J. at 224.\\n                                        12\\n                                         B.\\n\\n      This case calls upon the Court to determine whether an indemnification\\n\\nprovision provides for the recovery of attorneys’ fees in a first-party claim,\\n\\nsuch as here, where Boyle, the party to be indemnified, files a claim against\\n\\nthe Association, the party agreeing to indemnify -- as opposed to a claim\\n\\ninvolving a third party, where a unit owner sues Boyle in his role as a trustee\\n\\nfor the Association.\\n\\n      We begin, as we must, with the text we interpret. Article VI, Section 1\\n\\nof the Association’s bylaws provides as follows:\\n\\n            The Trustees and officers shall not be liable to the Unit\\n            Owners for any mistake of judgment, negligence or\\n            otherwise, except for their own individual willful\\n            misconduct or bad faith. The Association shall\\n            indemnify every Trustee and officer . . . against all loss,\\n            costs and expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably\\n            incurred by him in connection with any action, suit, or\\n            proceeding to which he may be a party by reason of his\\n            being or having been a Trustee or officer of the\\n            Association except as to matters as to which he shall be\\n            finally adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding to be\\n            liable for willful misconduct or bad faith. In the event\\n            of a settlement, indemnification shall be provided only\\n            in connection with such matters covered by the\\n            settlement as to which the Association is advised by\\n            counsel that the person to be indemnified had not been\\n            guilty of willful misconduct or bad faith in his\\n            performance of his duty as such Trustee or officer in\\n            relation to the matter involved.\\n\\n            [(emphasis added).]\\n\\n                                        13\\n       Article VI, Section 1 thus consists of three sentences, the second of\\n\\nwhich expressly provides that “[t]he Association shall indemnify every\\n\\nTrustee” for litigation expenses arising out of an individual’s role as trustee\\n\\nabsent willful misconduct or bad faith. To “indemnify” means “(1) [t]o\\n\\nreimburse (another) for a loss suffered because of a third party’s or one’s own\\n\\nact or default; hold harmless; (2) to promise to reimburse (another) for such a\\n\\nloss; and (3) to give (another) security against such loss.” Black’s Law\\n\\nDictionary 918 (11th ed. 2019). The very definition of the term extends\\n\\nindemnification to first or third parties, and the second sentence does not limit\\n\\nits application; indeed, the second sentence provides for indemnification\\n\\n“against all loss . . . in connection with any action.” Ibid. (emphases added).\\n\\n      Read in isolation, it is not difficult to see how that phrase could support\\n\\nindemnification here, as Boyle argues and the Appellate Division found. Were\\n\\nwe to focus solely on that single sentence, an obligation to indemnify a trustee\\n\\ncould be construed to extend to all manner of lawsuits and actions -- including\\n\\nactions by one trustee against another -- any time a trustee is a party to an\\n\\naction that arises from the trustee’s position, absent willful misconduct or bad\\n\\nfaith by the trustee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        14\\n       But that narrow focus excludes all the remaining provisions of the\\n\\nparagraph. Reading Article VI, Section 1 in its entirety sets forth the full\\n\\nscope and limits of the nature of the indemnification intended.\\n\\n      The first sentence identifies the nature of the actions anticipated,\\n\\nnamely, actions taken by the “[u]nit [o]wners” against a trustee. It states that\\n\\n“[t]rustees . . . shall not be liable to the [u]nit [o]wners for any mistake of\\n\\njudgment, negligence or otherwise, except for their own individual willful\\n\\nmisconduct or bad faith.” (emphasis added). Reading the second sentence\\n\\nafter the first offers a different view of the provision’s scope: that it only\\n\\nrelates to claims brought by unit owners against trustees, thus providing\\n\\nindemnification for third-party but not first-party claims.\\n\\n      That more limited view of the second sentence finds support in the third\\n\\nsentence of the paragraph, which grants the Association a basis to withhold\\n\\nindemnification if its counsel advises that any part of the settlement is\\n\\nattributable to a trustee’s willful misconduct or bad faith. In other words, in\\n\\nthe case of a settlement -- i.e., absent a judicial determination regarding\\n\\nmisconduct or bad faith -- the third sentence places counsel for the Association\\n\\nin the position of assessing a trustee’s conduct. This type of assessment would\\n\\nbe illogical if the second sentence were to extend indemnification to suits in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         15\\n which the Association and the trustees were adverse, such as in suits brought\\n\\nby trustees against the Association.\\n\\n      In short, the interplay between the third sentence, in which the\\n\\nAssociation’s own counsel must judge the indemnitee trustee’s behavior, and\\n\\nthe first sentence, which provides that trustees “shall not be liable to the [u]nit\\n\\n[o]wners,” suggests that the more reasonable interpretation of the second\\n\\nsentence is that the agreement was meant to cover any and all actions by unit\\n\\nowners who bring actions against trustees in their capacity as trustees.\\n\\n      Although exclusive focus on the second sentence suggests that\\n\\nindemnification might extend to first-party claims, such focus disregards our\\n\\nrules of construction, which require review of the entirety of a provision to\\n\\nglean the intent of the parties and preclude interpreting words or phrases in\\n\\nisolation. See Hardy, 198 N.J. at 103; Republic Bus. Credit Corp., 381 N.J.\\n\\nSuper. at 569. Reading the second sentence in the context of Article VI,\\n\\nSection 1 as a whole leads to the conclusion that the entire paragraph relates to\\n\\nthird-party claims by unit owners against trustees and those trustees will\\n\\ntherefore be indemnified for all costs reasonably incurred only when unit\\n\\nowners initiate an action against them in their capacity as trustees, and no\\n\\nwillful misconduct or bad faith is found.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        16\\n       At minimum, the indemnification provision is ambiguous and must\\n\\ntherefore be construed against Boyle as the indemnitee. See Kieffer, 205 N.J.\\n\\nat 223-24. Contrary to the conclusion reached by the Appellate Division, we\\n\\ncannot presume first-party coverage in the absence of language precluding it;\\n\\nrather, there must be affirmative indicia of the intent to indemnify to overcome\\n\\nthe presumption that parties will each pay their own way. See id. at 224.\\n\\n                                       C.\\n\\n      In holding that the indemnification provision does not cover Boyle’s\\n\\nclaims, we stress that we do not agree with defendants’ assertion that “it is\\n\\naxiomatic” that indemnification must be based on third-party claims.\\n\\n      For that proposition, defendants rely upon a previous holding of the\\n\\nAppellate Division that a disputed indemnification agreement could not be\\n\\n“presented as a shield against claims asserted against the indemnitee by the\\n\\nindemnitor” because “an indemnification agreement must be based upon ‘the\\n\\nindemnitee’s claim to obtain recovery from the indemnitor for liability\\n\\nincurred to a third party.’” Invs. Sav. Bank v. Waldo Jersey City, LLC, 418\\n\\nN.J. Super 149, 159 (App. Div. 2011) (quoting Travelers Indem. Co. v.\\n\\nDammann & Co., 592 F. Supp. 2d 752, 766-67 (D.N.J. 2008), aff’d, 594 F.3d\\n\\n238 (3d Cir. 2010)). That holding was rooted in the appellate court’s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       17\\n observation that no New Jersey case had found that an indemnity claim could\\n\\nsupport a first-party action. Ibid.\\n\\n      We now find that it is not axiomatic that indemnification is limited only\\n\\nto third-party claims. Rather, indemnification may also apply to first-party\\n\\nclaims if that is the clear intent of the parties as expressed by their deliberate\\n\\nword choices when drafting contracts. Those word choices will govern\\n\\nwhether an indemnification provision supports a first- or third-party claim for\\n\\ndamages.\\n\\n      Although this Court has never previously held that a contract should\\n\\ncontain express language to permit indemnification of first-party claims, our\\n\\nprior decisions support such a conclusion. In Kieffer, this Court held that it\\n\\nwas possible for a party to a contract to draft a provision for indemnification\\n\\neven for an indemnitee’s own negligence, 205 N.J. at 224, but stressed that a\\n\\nprovision shifting liability to an “indemnitor must be accomplished only\\n\\nthrough express and unequivocal language,” id. at 225. In doing so, we\\n\\nacknowledged that the parties were free to contract for indemnification where\\n\\nthe indemnitor was found negligent but added that any ambiguity in the terms\\n\\nwould defeat indemnification. Id. at 225-26. And in exploring whether parties\\n\\ncould contract for indemnification based upon one party’s own fault, this Court\\n\\nhas made clear “that the agreement must specifically reference the negligence\\n\\n                                         18\\n or fault of the indemnitee.” Azurak v. Corp. Prop. Inv’rs, 175 N.J. 110, 112-\\n\\n13 (2003).\\n\\n      Our case law underscores New Jersey’s strong public policy in favor of\\n\\nthe freedom to contract, Rodriguez v. Raymours Furniture Co., Inc., 225 N.J.\\n\\n343, 360-61 (2016), limited in those circumstances where a contract would\\n\\notherwise violate public policy, Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., 100 N.J. 325, 335\\n\\n(1985). We therefore decline to endorse the Association’s bright-line rule that\\n\\nindemnification applies only to third-party claims. Parties are free to\\n\\ndetermine whether to extend indemnification provisions to first-party actions\\n\\nor limit them solely to third-party actions.\\n\\n      Nevertheless, given the caselaw discussed above, we encourage parties\\n\\nseeking to permit indemnification of first-party claims to include express\\n\\nlanguage to do so. Otherwise, any ambiguity will continue to be construed\\n\\nagainst the indemnitee. See Kieffer, 205 N.J. at 223-24.\\n\\n                                       IV.\\n\\n      The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed. Because we hold\\n\\nthat the indemnification provision does not cover Boyle’s claims, we find it\\n\\nunnecessary to address the remaining questions.\\n\\n     CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES PATTERSON, SOLOMON,\\nPIERRE-LOUIS, and WAINER APTER join in JUSTICE NORIEGA’s opinion.\\nJUSTICE FASCIALE did not participate.\\n\\n\\n                                        19\\n '),\n",

The trial court's order includes a finding that husband earned gross monthly income of $5,483.56, approximately 65 percent of the parties' combined income. After determining a basic child support obligation of $1,582 for the parties' two minor children, the court calculated husband's pro rata share of the basic child support obligation to be $986.75. As evidenced in Schedule E attached to the court's order, however, the court applied a parenting time deviation of $434.66, reducing husband's monthly child support obligation to $552.09. See OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(K). Husband does not on appeal challenge the court's decision to deviate from the presumptive child support obligation. Instead, he contends the trial court erred by failing to explain how the court calculated the deviation and failing to include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children and would not seriously impair his ability to provide for the children. We agree.\\nBecause the trial court's order in this case was entered after July 1, 2008, the revised child support guidelines in OCGA § 19-6-15, including the 2008 amendments thereto, are applicable.

Palmer, Katherine E. Fagan, McDonough, for appellant.\\nEdea M. Caldwell, McDonough, for appellee.\\nTHOMPSON, Justice.\\nRaymond and Jessica Turner were married in 1999 and had two children. Raymond filed for divorce in January 2008. The parties reached a partial settlement agreement which provided, inter alia, that husband and wife would share joint legal and physical custody of their two minor children, the custody arrangement being structured so husband is to have physical custody of the children from Friday a.m. until Tuesday a.m., and wife is to have physical custody from Tuesday a.m. through Friday a.m., with exceptions for holidays and other special occasions. Husband also agreed to pay wife $11,000 representing her interest in the marital residence. Left unresolved and submitted to the trial court for determination were issues of child support and the division of extracurricular expenses. The parties waived a hearing, and after an in-chambers conference, the court entered a final judgment and divorce decree which incorporated the partial settlement agreement, ordered husband to pay $552.09 in monthly child support, and apportioned the expenses for the children's extracurricular activities two-thirds to husband and one-third to wife. This Court granted husband's application for discretionary review pursuant to the Family Law Pilot Project.[1]\", metadata={'source': 'opinion_text/1327652_Turner v. Turner.txt'})]}\n"
