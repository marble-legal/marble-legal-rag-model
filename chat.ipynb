FUNVESTMENT GROUP, LLC v. CRITTENDEN.\\n\\n      BARNES, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      This appeal seeks to overturn a superior court’s judgment in favor of Robyn A.\\n\\nCrittenden, in her official capacity as the Commissioner of the Georgia Department\\n\\nof Revenue (the “Department”),1 and against Funvestment Group, LLC (the\\n\\n“Taxpayer”). The contested ruling rejected the Taxpayer’s claim that the amount it\\n\\npaid to lease certain of its business equipment is exempt from sales and use taxation.\\n\\nFor the reasons explained below, the judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part.\\n\\n      These facts are undisputed. The Taxpayer operates a business where children\\n\\ncan drive miniature vehicles along an indoor track and learn about driving safety. At\\n\\n\\n      1\\n     During the course of this litigation, Commissioner Crittenden replaced former\\nCommissioner David M. Curry. See OCGA § 9-11-25 (d) (1).\\n its business, the Taxpayer also offers an arcade room, party rooms for group events,\\n\\na restaurant, and a lab equipped with touchscreen computers and simulators. The\\n\\nTaxpayer leases certain of its business equipment – relevant here, its “coin operated\\n\\namusement machines” a/k/a “COAMs” – from another entity, (non-party) Tiny\\n\\nTowne International, LLC. In leasing its COAMs during the relevant period, the\\n\\nTaxpayer was contractually obligated to pay Tiny Towne “10 percent [ ] of the total\\n\\ngross revenue after deductions for state master license, state sticker fees and refunds[]\\n\\nand 10 [percent] of other gross income generated by [the Taxpayer’s] business.”\\n\\n      The primary question in this appeal is whether the amount paid to lease the\\n\\nCOAMs is exempt from taxation by OCGA § 48-8-3 (43):\\n\\n      The sales and use taxes levied or imposed by this article shall not apply\\n      to: . . . [g]ross revenues generated from all bona fide coin operated\\n      amusement machines which vend or dispense music or are operated for\\n      skill, amusement, entertainment, or pleasure which are in commercial\\n      use and are provided to the public for play which will require a permit\\n      fee under Chapter 27 of title 50.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n       Regarding the procedural background, the Taxpayer filed a petition with the\\n\\nGeorgia Tax Tribunal2 seeking reprieve from the Department’s assessment of sales\\n\\nand use tax on payments made for leasing the COAMS.3 On cross-motions for\\n\\nsummary judgment, each party contended that OCGA § 48-8-3 (43) was plain and\\n\\nunambiguous such that application thereof rendered the result it urged. The Tax\\n\\nTribunal entered a decision in the Taxpayer’s favor, concluding that “OCGA § 48-8-3\\n\\n(43) exempts [the Taxpayer] . . . from paying sales and use tax on its lease payments\\n\\nto Tiny Towne[.]”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2\\n        The Georgia Tax Tribunal is an independent, specialized agency created by\\nthe General Assembly “to resolve disputes between the [D]epartment and taxpayers\\nin an efficient and cost-effective manner.” OCGA § 50-13A-2. See also OCGA §§\\n50-13A-1 (“This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the ‘Georgia Tax\\nTribunal Act of 2012.’”); 50-13A-3 (“As used in this chapter, the term ‘tribunal’\\nmeans the Georgia Tax Tribunal established by Code Section 50-13A-4 which shall\\nbe an independent and autonomous division within the Office of State Administrative\\nHearings operating under the sole direction of the chief tribunal judge.”); 50-13A-4\\n(creating the Georgia Tax Tribunal).\\n      3\\n        The parties agreed that the charges for customer operations of the COAMs\\nwere not subject to sales and use tax, and that the Department did not assess\\nadditional tax on those transactions.\\n\\n                                         3\\n       Pursuant to OCGA § 50-13A-17,4 the Department sought judicial review by the\\n\\nFulton County Superior Court. The court concluded that the Taxpayer could not\\n\\nutilize that statutory exemption, determining that the exemption applies “to revenue\\n\\ngenerated from plays of COAMs, but does not apply to lease transactions of\\n\\nCOAMs.” Among other things, the court reasoned:\\n\\n      [T]he plain language of the exemption means the COAM itself must\\n      “generate” the revenue by “vend[ing] or dispens[ing]” music or public\\n      play by inserting money. Because the leases do not constitute\\n      remuneration for “vend[ing] or dispens[ing]”music or public play, the\\n      exemption clearly applies only to the money inserted into the COAMs\\n      for play, not leases of the COAMs themselves.\\n\\n\\n(Emphasis in original.) The court went on to ascertain that the Taxpayer’s “expansive\\n\\ninterpretation of OCGA § 48-8-3 (43) would lead to absurd results.” As the court saw\\n\\nit, the Taxpayer’s position – which it summarized as “the lease payment it makes on\\n\\nCOAMS[,] where some percentage of the payment includes participation play\\n\\nrevenue[,] should be exempt from taxation simply because such payments are\\n\\npartially made with money generated from participation play” – would lead to the\\n\\n\\n\\n      4\\n       See OCGA § 50-13A-17 (a), (b) (providing that any party may appeal a final\\ndecision of the Tax Tribunal to the Superior Court of Fulton County).\\n\\n                                         4\\n untenable circumstance that any subsequent transaction using revenue from COAM\\n\\nparticipation plays would also be exempt. For example, the court elaborated: “Under\\n\\n[the Taxpayer’s] interpretation, any purchase or lease of building, facilities, utilities,\\n\\nsupplies, fixtures, furniture, etc., would be exempt as long as the purchases or leases\\n\\nwere made with revenues from COAM participation plays.” Additionally, the court\\n\\ncited Ga. Dept. of Revenue v. Owens Corning, \\n283 Ga. 489\\n (660 SE2d 719) (2008),\\n\\nfor the principle that “the interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency\\n\\nwhich has the duty of enforcing or administering it is to be given great weight and\\n\\ndeference.” \\nId. at 490\\n. Moreover, the superior court found that the legislative history\\n\\nsurrounding the taxation of COAMs showed legislative intent to “exempt gross\\n\\nrevenue generated from customers playing the machines, not leases.” Finally, the\\n\\nsuperior court went on to hold that “[w]ithout proper evidence of the lease payments,\\n\\nthe Department may assess sales tax for the leases based on the sales price of the\\n\\nCOAMs.” In light thereof, the superior court reversed the Tax Tribunal’s decision,\\n\\nand remanded the case for judgment to be entered in favor of the Department.\\n\\nDissatisfied with the superior court’s order, the Taxpayer procured this discretionary\\n\\nappeal.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            5\\n       1. The Taxpayer contests the superior court’s determination that OCGA § 48-8-\\n\\n3 (43) does not apply to their lease payments. “The interpretation of a statute is a\\n\\nquestion of law, which is reviewed de novo on appeal.” Junior v. Graham, \\n313 Ga.\\n\\n420\\n, 423 (2) (870 SE2d 378) (2022); see Amazing Amusements Group v. Wilson, \\n353\\n\\nGa. App. 256\\n, 256 (835 SE2d 781) (2019) (applying de novo standard of review,\\n\\nwhere case turned on statutory interpretation and resolution of questions of law).\\n\\n      (a) The Taxpayer contends that the superior court erred “by giving the words\\n\\n‘gross revenue’ an unnatural meaning which limit those words to revenue generated\\n\\nfrom playing COAMs when the General Assembly did not include any words of\\n\\nlimitation.”\\n\\n      In support of this contention, the Taxpayer recites dictionary definitions of\\n\\n“gross revenues”;5 discerns therefrom that the ordinary and everyday meaning of\\n\\n“‘gross revenues’ does not limit [the exemption] to any particular source of revenue”;\\n\\nand asserts that “[n]owhere in the plain language does OCGA § 48-8-3 (43) limit the\\n\\n\\n\\n      5\\n       In particular, the Taxpayer recites that “gross revenues” is defined by Black’s\\nLaw Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) as “Income from any and all sources; gross income\\nor gross receipts”; further, the Taxpayer recites that Merriam Webster Dictionary\\ndefines “gross” as “consisting of an overall total exclusive of deductions” and\\n“revenue” as “the total income produced by a given source.”\\n\\n                                          6\\n . . . exemption to the transaction of playing COAMS.” The Taxpayer thus posits, “The\\n\\nonly natural reading of the exemption includes leased income in the gross revenues.”\\n\\n        Even accepting the Taxpayer’s premise concerning the applicable definition(s)\\n\\nof “gross revenues,”6 we find no merit in the Taxpayer’s ultimate position, because\\n\\nit disregards the express language requiring that the contemplated “gross revenues”\\n\\nwere “generated from all bona fide coin operated amusement machines which vend\\n\\nor dispense music or are operated for skill, amusement, entertainment, or pleasure\\n\\nwhich are in commercial use and are provided to the public for play.” OCGA § 48-8-3\\n\\n(43).\\n\\n        When we consider the meaning of a statute, we must presume that the\\n        General Assembly meant what it said and said what it meant. To that\\n        end, we must afford the statutory text its plain and ordinary meaning, we\\n        must view the statutory text in the context in which it appears, and we\\n        must read the statutory text in its most natural and reasonable way, as an\\n        ordinary speaker of the English language would.\\n\\n\\n\\n        6\\n        See generally Smith v. Northside Hosp., \\n302 Ga. 517\\n, 521 (1) (807 SE2d 909)\\n(2017) (consulting dictionaries as part of statutory interpretation); Abdel-Samed v.\\nDailey, \\n294 Ga. 758\\n, 763 (2) (755 SE2d 805) (2014) (consulting dictionaries as part\\nof statutory interpretation). And see, e. g., United States v.

Continental Cas. Co., \\n277 Ga.\\n\\n189\\n, 191 (587 SE2d 24) (2003).\\n\\n      Hence, we reject the Taxpayer’s argument that:\\n\\n      Nowhere in the plain language does OCGA § 48-8-3 (43) limit the sales\\n      and use tax exemption to the transaction of playing COAMS. . . . [T]he\\n      General Assembly chose not to limit the exemption. As the statute reads,\\n      the exemption applies to all gross revenue including gross revenue from\\n      the COAMS used to make lease payments.7\\n\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) Not only is the Taxpayer’s position contrary to the principles\\n\\nnoted above, the position fails to accord with these well-settled standards for\\n\\nreviewing taxation statutes:\\n\\n      Taxation is the rule, and exemption from taxation is the exception. . . .\\n      Exemption, being the exception to the general rule, is not favored; but\\n      every exemption, to be valid, must be expressed in clear and\\n      unambiguous terms, and, when found to exist, the enactment by which\\n\\n      7\\n         Elsewhere in its brief, the Taxpayer claims that, contrary to the superior\\ncourt’s assertion, “[it] has never argued ‘that the lease payments it makes on COAMs\\nwhere some percentage of the payment includes participation play revenue should be\\nexempt from taxation simply because such payments are partially made with money\\ngenerated from participation plan.’” (Emphasis in brief.)\\n\\n                                         8\\n       it is given will not be enlarged by construction, but, on the contrary, will\\n      be strictly construed.\\n\\n\\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Owens Corning, 283 Ga. at 489 (reciting\\n\\nprinciples for determining applicability of exemption set forth in § 48-8-3). The\\n\\nstatutory provision at issue here, OCGA § 48-8-3 (43), contains no clear and\\n\\nunambiguous expression of an exemption applicable also to the Taxpayer’s lease\\n\\npayments to Tiny Towne.\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, this challenge to the superior court’s judgment lacks\\n\\nmerit. See generally Spectera, Inc. v. Wilson, \\n294 Ga. 23\\n, 26 (1) (a) (749 SE2d 704)\\n\\n(2013) (“Where the language of a statute is plain and susceptible to only one natural\\n\\nand reasonable construction, courts must construe the statute accordingly. In fact,\\n\\nwhere the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, judicial construction is not\\n\\nonly unnecessary but forbidden.”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      (b) Seeking to avoid such interpretation of the plain language of OCGA § 48-8-\\n\\n3 (43), the Taxpayer advances the following arguments.\\n\\n      (i) The Taxpayer contends that the superior court committed reversible error\\n\\n“when it found that the Tax Tribunal’s decision was erroneous as a matter of law\\n\\nbecause it failed to accord deference to the Department in the interpretation of its\\n\\n                                           9\\n statutes.” In an attempt to support this contention, however, the Taxpayer misplaces\\n\\nreliance on language only recently added to OCGA § 50-13A-14 (a).8 And at any rate,\\n\\nbecause the pertinent language in OCGA § 48-8-3 (43) is “not ambiguous, we do not\\n\\nreach the question of whether deference is appropriate[.]” City of Guyton v. Barrow,\\n\\n305 Ga. 799\\n, 804 (2) (828 SE2d 366) (2019) (noting that “[d]eference is not due\\n\\nunless a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, is left with an\\n\\nunresolved ambiguity”; and reiterating that an ambiguity exists only after a court has\\n\\nexhausted all tools of construction) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      (ii) In interrelated claims of error, the Taxpayer contends that the record does\\n\\nnot support the superior court’s finding that “the legislative history surrounding the\\n\\ntaxation of COAMs shows that it was the General Assembly’s intention to exempt\\n\\ngross revenue generated from customers playing machines, not leases.” The Taxpayer\\n\\ngoes on to proffer its own discernment of legislative history to contend that the\\n\\n\\n      8\\n        Specifically, the Taxpayer cites the following language: “All questions of law\\ndecided by the tribunal, including interpretations of constitutional, statutory, and\\nregulatory provisions, shall be made without any deference to any determination or\\ninterpretation, whether written or unwritten, that may have been made on the matter\\nby the Department of Revenue[.]” OCGA § 50-13A-14 (a). Such language, however,\\napplies to “proceedings commenced before the Georgia Tax Tribunal or a superior\\ncourt of this state on or after [April 29, 2021].” Ga. L. 2021, p. 120, §§ 4, 5.\\nProceedings in this case commenced in the superior court prior to that date.\\n\\n                                         10\\n General Assembly instead intended to exempt lease payments when it enacted OCGA\\n\\n§ 48-8-3 (43).\\n\\n      According to the Taxpayer, OCGA § 48-8-3 (43) was enacted as part of\\n\\n“wholesale changes to the way the [S]tate regulates and taxes COAMS.” As the\\n\\nTaxpayer surmises, “[l]ocation licenses purchased by [COAM] lessees took the place\\n\\nof collecting sales tax on revenue generated from playing COAMS and master\\n\\nlicenses took the place of collecting sales tax on revenue generated from leasing\\n\\nCOAMs.”9 The Taxpayer goes on to assert that legislative intent to exempt monies\\n\\npaid to lease COAMS is demonstrated further by “the economic impact upon\\n\\nthousands of small businesses in the COAM industry” that otherwise would be taxed\\n\\non such lease amounts. Morever, as the Taxpayer sees it, allowing the Department to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      9\\n        As the Taxpayer asserts,\\n      The fact [that] the State ties the cost of the master license fee to the\\n      [S]tate sales and use tax rate shows that the legislature intended OCGA\\n      § 48-8-3 (43) to exempt sales and use tax on lease payments because the\\n      master license fee replaced and supplanted sales tax collected on COAM\\n      leases. The legislature enacted OCGA § 48-8-3 (43) with the intention\\n      it would apply to revenue generated from leasing COAMs because it\\n      eliminated the old system of taxing them.\\nThe Taxpayer’s assertions in this regard lack record citation and supporting case\\nauthority.\\n\\n                                        11\\n tax the amount paid to lease COAMs after the COAM-lessee has already paid for a\\n\\nlocation license amounts to “double taxation.”10\\n\\n      “[O]ur well established rules of statutory interpretation require courts to\\n\\nascertain the legislature’s intent in enacting the law in question.” (Citation,\\n\\npunctuation, and emphasis omitted.)

If, on the other hand, the words of the statute are\\n      ambiguous, then [the appellate court] must construe the statute, keeping\\n      in mind the purpose of the statute and the old law, the evil, and the\\n      remedy.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Busch v. State, \\n271 Ga. 591\\n, 592 (523 SE2d 21)\\n\\n(1999). As relevant here, the words of the statutory provision are plain; notably, the\\n\\nTaxpayer makes no assertion otherwise. As explained in Division 1 (a), supra, the\\n\\nplain statutory language does not provide for an exemption additionally for amounts\\n\\npaid to lease COAMs; and “[the Taxpayer] has failed to detail how the plain-language\\n\\n\\n      11\\n          The Taxpayer insists that it has never argued that the lease payments are\\nexempt only because they stem from the COAM participation play. As the Taxpayer\\nclarifies in its brief, it “maintain[s] that OCGA § 48-8-[3 (43)] exempts the lease\\npayments because the lease payments are ‘[g]ross revenues generated from all bona\\nfide coin operated amusement machines which . . . are in commercial use and are\\nprovided to the public for play which will require a permit fee under Chapter 27 or\\ntitle 50.’” Even with this clarification, the Taxpayer’s position fails.

Fulton County, \\n302 Ga. 70\\n, 73 (1) (805 SE2d 56) (2017).\\n\\n      2. The Taxpayer contends that the superior court erred when it reversed the Tax\\n\\nTribunal’s decision without finding, as required by OCGA § 50-13A-17 (g), that\\n\\nsubstantial rights of the Department had been prejudiced by that decision.\\n\\n      Pursuant to OCGA § 50-13A-17, which the superior court expressly cited in\\n\\nits order, any party may appeal a final decision of the Tax Tribunal to the Superior\\n\\nCourt of Fulton County. See OCGA § 50-13A-17 (a), (b). Subsection (g) of that Code\\n\\nsection provides that the superior court defers to the Tax Tribunal’s factual findings;\\n\\nthat the court may affirm the Tax Tribunals’s judgment or remand the case for further\\n\\nproceedings; and that, in addition,\\n\\n      [t]he [superior] court may reverse or modify the judgment if substantial\\n      rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the tribunal\\n      judge’s findings, inferences, conclusions, or judgments are: (1) In\\n      violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) In excess of the\\n      statutory authority of the tribunal; (3) Made upon unlawful procedure;\\n      (4) Affected by other error of law; (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the\\n      reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6)\\n      Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\\n      unwarranted exercise of discretion.\\n\\n                                          16\\n (Emphasis supplied.)

For reasons explained above, the\\n\\nsuperior court correctly concluded that the Tax Tribunal’s decision was violative of\\n\\nOCGA § 48-8-3 (43); hence, reversal of the Tax Tribunal’s decision was authorized\\n\\nby OCGA § 50-13A-17 (g). This contention lacks merit.\\n\\n      3. The Taxpayer challenges the superior court’s determinations that the record\\n\\nlacked proper evidence of the lease payments for the relevant period,12 and that the\\n\\nDepartment could thus assess sales tax for the leases based on the sales price of the\\n\\nCOAMs.\\n\\n      The Tax Tribunal did not reach these issues, however, as it decided that OCGA\\n\\n§ 48-8-3 (43) exempted the Taxpayer from paying tax on its lease payments to Tiny\\n\\nTowne. Therefore, that portion of the contested superior court order is vacated.

KUNKEL et al. v. HILLMAN.\\n\\n      GOBEIL, Judge.\\n\\n      Andrew and Amber Kunkel appeal from the trial court’s grant of summary\\n\\njudgment to defendant James R. Hillman, Jr. in this breach of contract action, arguing\\n\\nthat the trial court erred by (1) denying their motion for leave to add a corporation as\\n\\na party defendant and (2) granting Hillman’s motion for summary judgment. For the\\n\\nreasons that follow, we reverse the trial court’s order denying the motion to add a\\n\\nparty and vacate the grant of summary judgment.\\n\\n      The record shows that in 2017, Amber Kunkel visited the showroom of Hillman\\n\\nFlooring & Design to inquire about replacing water-damaged flooring in the Kunkels’\\n\\nhome. Hillman Flooring & Design is a trade name of Ceramic Surfaces, Inc., a\\n company in which Hillman and his wife each have a 50 percent ownership interest.\\n\\nDuring the construction project, the Kunkels dealt with a number of Hillman Flooring\\n\\n& Design employees, including Hillman, and e-mails and invoices from the business\\n\\ninclude the name “Hillman Flooring & Design.” A check written by the Kunkels\\n\\nshows “Hillman Flooring & Design” as the payee.\\n\\n      In October 2021, the Kunkels filed a breach of contract action against Hillman\\n\\nin his individual capacity, alleging that after completion of the project, numerous\\n\\nproblems arose with the work, including cupping and shrinkage of their hardwood\\n\\nfloors. On December 17, 2021, Hillman answered the complaint. In his answer, he\\n\\nmaintained that the contract at issue was between the Kunkels and “Ceramic\\n\\nSurfaces, Inc. d/b/a Hillman Flooring & Design,” and he therefore argued that the\\n\\ncomplaint should be dismissed because the Kunkels did not have claims against him\\n\\nindividually. He clarified that Hillman Flooring & Design is not a registered\\n\\ncorporation, but is a trade name for Ceramic Surfaces, Inc.1\\n\\n\\n      1\\n        Hillman testified at his deposition that he and his wife mistakenly believed that\\nthey had registered “Hillman Flooring & Design” as a trade name of Ceramic\\nSurfaces, but learned through their bank that they had failed to do so. To rectify the\\nsituation, Hillman filed a trade name registration in Gwinnett County Superior Court\\non December 3, 2021.\\n                                           2\\n       The parties engaged in extensive discovery. Then, on January 27, 2023, the\\n\\nKunkels filed a motion for leave to add Ceramic Surfaces, Inc. as a party defendant.\\n\\nHillman objected, and the trial court held a hearing on the motion. The trial court\\n\\ndenied the motion, reasoning that the Kunkels were aware of the existence of Ceramic\\n\\nSurfaces in December 2021 via Hillman’s answer, and they had failed to show any\\n\\nexcuse or justification for failing to add Ceramic Services “as a party at this late stage\\n\\nof the litigation.”\\n\\n      Hillman then filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that he was not a\\n\\nproper party, and all claims against him should be dismissed. In response, the Kunkels\\n\\nfiled affidavits in which they averred that, throughout all of their dealings with\\n\\nHillman and his associates, the name “Ceramic Surfaces” was never mentioned. After\\n\\na hearing, the trial court granted the motion, and this appeal followed.\\n\\n      1. The Kunkels first argue that the trial court erred by denying their motion to\\n\\nadd Ceramic Surfaces as a party defendant. We agree.\\n\\n      OCGA § 9-11-21 provides that “[p]arties may be dropped or added by order of\\n\\nthe court on motion of any party. . . at any stage of the action and on such terms as are\\n\\njust.” In deciding whether to add a party,\\n\\n\\n                                            3\\n       the trial court must construe OCGA § 9-11-21 in conjunction with\\n      OCGA § 9-11-15 (c), which allows an amendment adding a party to relate\\n      back to the filing of the original complaint “whenever the claim . . .\\n      asserted in the amended pleading arises out of the conduct, transaction,\\n      or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original\\n      pleading.”\\n\\n\\nSeay v. Valdosta Kidney Clinic, LLC, \\n353 Ga. App. 378\\n, 380 (1) (\\n837 SE2d 529\\n) (2020)\\n\\n(punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      “A trial court’s decision as to whether a party should be added to a lawsuit lies\\n\\nin the trial court’s sound discretion and will be overturned on appeal only upon a\\n\\nshowing of abuse of that discretion.” Gonzalez v. Jones, \\n369 Ga. App. 358\\n, 361 (\\n893\\n\\nSE2d 528\\n) (2023) (citations and punctuation omitted). That said, “[w]e have held\\n\\nthat when a plaintiff can satisfy the statutory requirements for relation back of an\\n\\namendment, set out in OCGA § 9-11-15 (c), denying a motion for leave to amend the\\n\\ncomplaint to add a defendant is an abuse of the trial court’s discretion.” Rasheed v.\\n\\nKlopp Enterprises, Inc., \\n276 Ga. App. 91\\n, 92 (1) (\\n622 SE2d 442\\n) (2005) (footnote\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n      OCGA § 9-11-15 (c) provides in relevant part:\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          4\\n       An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted\\n      relates back to the date of the original pleadings if . . . within the period\\n      provided by law for commencing the action against him the party to be\\n      brought in by amendment (1) has received such notice of the institution\\n      of the action that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining his defense on\\n      the merits, and (2) should have known that, but for a mistake concerning\\n      the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought\\n      against him.\\n\\n\\n      Thus, to bring an existing claim against a new defendant where the statute of\\n\\nlimitation has expired,2\\n\\n      the moving party must show that each of the following three conditions\\n      is met: (1) the amendment adding the new defendant arose out of the\\n      same facts as the original complaint; (2) the new defendant had sufficient\\n      notice of the action that [it] will not be prejudiced in maintaining [its]\\n      defense on the merits; and (3) the new defendant knew or should have\\n      known that but for a mistake concerning [its] identity as a proper party,\\n      the action would have been brought against [it].\\n\\n\\nGonzalez, 369 Ga. App. at 362 (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n\\n      2\\n        During the proceedings below, the parties disputed whether this action was\\ngoverned by OCGA § 9-3-25 (four-year limitation period for action on contract\\nconsidered to be in parol) or OCGA § 9-3-24 (six-year statute of limitation for action\\non written contract). We will assume, for purposes of this appeal only, that the four\\nyear statute of limitation applies.\\n                                           5\\n       Here, the trial court denied the motion on the sole ground that the Kunkels had\\n\\n“failed to show justification for their one-year delay in seeking to add ‘Ceramic\\n\\nSurfaces, Inc.’ as [a] party.” However, we have held that “[m]ere delay in filing a\\n\\nmotion to amend is not enough to warrant the denial of such a motion. Thus, while\\n\\nlaches and unexcused delay may bar a proposed amendment, the mere fact that an\\n\\namendment is offered late in the case is not enough to bar it if the other party is not\\n\\nprejudiced.” Seay, 353 Ga. App. at 380 (1) (citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis\\n\\nsupplied).\\n\\n      The Kunkels’ motion to add Ceramic Surfaces as a party defendant met the\\n\\nabove-described relation-back requirements. The proposed amendment would not\\n\\nhave altered the substance of the breach of contract claim and stemmed from the same\\n\\nset of facts alleged in the original complaint. Furthermore, Ceramic Surfaces had\\n\\nnotice of the action via Hillman’s involvement in the litigation, and thus there is no\\n\\nevidence of prejudice or dilatory tactics by the Kunkels. See Oconee County v. Cannon,\\n\\n310 Ga. 728\\n, 735 (2) (\\n854 SE2d 531\\n) (2021) (“the defendant’s knowledge, not the\\n\\nnature of the plaintiff’s mistake, is the key factor in determining whether relation-back\\n\\napplies”); Seay, 353 Ga. App. at 381 (1) (“mere delay in seeking leave to amend was\\n\\n\\n                                           6\\n not a sufficient reason for denying the plaintiffs’ motion[, and] the loss of a statute of\\n\\nlimitation defense is not the type of prejudice necessary to foreclose such\\n\\namendment”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      In sum, because the Kunkels’ proposed amendment adding Ceramic Surfaces\\n\\nto the litigation related back to the timely-filed original complaint, the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion in denying the Kunkels’ motion to add it as a party defendant.\\n\\nOconee County, 310 Ga. at 732 (2); see Rasheed, \\n276 Ga. App. at 92-95\\n (1) (where\\n\\nplaintiffs’ motion to add party defendant satisfied requirements of OCGA § 9-11-15\\n\\n(c) and was not prejudicial, trial court abused its discretion in denying motion to add\\n\\nparty, which was filed 11 months after original complaint). We therefore reverse the\\n\\ntrial court’s order denying this motion.\\n\\n      2. The Kunkels also maintain that the trial court erred by granting summary\\n\\njudgment in favor of Hillman because there remains an issue of fact as to whether\\n\\nHillman was entitled to the shield a corporate entity provides.\\n\\n      Hillman premised his motion for summary judgment on the Kunkels’ failure\\n\\nto add Ceramic Surfaces/Hillman Flooring & Design as a defendant, arguing that\\n\\nHillman was not individually liable to the Kunkels. Given our holding in Division 1,\\n\\n\\n                                            7\\n the trial court’s grant of summary judgment to Hillman (on the basis of Ceramic\\n\\nSurfaces/Hillman Flooring & Design’s absence from the litigation3) was erroneous.\\n\\nWe therefore vacate the trial court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of\\n\\nHillman and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\\n\\nopinion. See Seay, 353 Ga. App. at 382 (2) (vacating trial court’s grant of summary\\n\\njudgment to medical providers in wrongful death action; vacation of order and remand\\n\\nwas necessary because trial court erred by denying plaintiffs’ motion to add\\n\\ndecedent’s widow to litigation).\\n\\n      Judgment reversed in part and vacated in part, and case remanded. Barnes, P. J.,\\n\\nand Pipkin, J., concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3\\n         Although the trial court’s order does not specify its precise reasoning for\\ngranting Hillman’s motion for summary judgment, because the only ground raised in\\nhis motion for summary judgment was the Kunkels’ failure to name Ceramic\\nSurfaces/Hillman Flooring & Design, we presume for purposes of this appeal that the\\ntrial court granted summary judgment for this reason.\\n                                          8\\n '),\n",

HAYES v. KSP SERVICES, LLC et al.; and\\n     vice versa.\\n\\n      MARKLE, Judge.\\n\\n      These related appeals arise from an automobile accident involving William\\n\\nHayes and Brian Gardner. At the time of the accident, Hayes was driving a vehicle\\n\\nowned by his employer, Waldrop’s Lawn Care, and Gardner was driving a vehicle\\n\\nowned by his employer, KSP Services, LLC. The trial court granted Gardner and\\n\\nKSP’s (collectively, “the Defendants”) motion for summary judgment, concluding\\n\\nthat Hayes was judicially estopped from bringing this negligence action due to\\n\\nrepresentations made in the course of settling his workers’ compensation claim against\\n\\nWaldrop. The trial court, however, denied the Defendants’ request for sanctions,\\n\\npursuant to OCGA § 9-11-37 (“Rule 37”), pertaining to their allegation that Hayes\\n intentionally failed to produce documents related to the settlement. In Case No.\\n\\nA24A0361, Hayes appeals from the trial court’s grant of summary judgment,\\n\\ncontending that the trial court misconstrued terms defined under the Workers’\\n\\nCompensation Act, OCGA § 34-9-1 et seq., in analyzing the settlement documents;\\n\\nand misapplied the judicial estoppel doctrine. In Case No. A24A0362, the Defendants\\n\\ncontend the trial court abused its discretion in denying their request for Rule 37\\n\\nsanctions. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the grant of summary judgment in\\n\\nCase No. A24A0361, but affirm the trial court’s judgment in Case No. A24A0362.\\n\\n            Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings and evidence\\n      show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\\n      moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Our review of\\n      a trial court’s grant of summary judgment is de novo, with all reasonable\\n      inferences construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\\n\\n\\n(Citation omitted.) Wakefield v. Kiser, \\n371 Ga. App. 113\\n (\\n899 SE2d 757\\n) (2024).\\n\\n      So viewed, the record shows that, at the time of the accident, Hayes was\\n\\nemployed by Waldrop, and Gardner was employed by KSP. Hayes was stopped in\\n\\ntraffic while driving Waldrop’s vehicle, when Gardner, who was driving KSP’s\\n\\nvehicle, rear-ended him. Hayes filed a workers’ compensation claim against Waldrop,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         2\\n and the parties entered into a “no liability” settlement, pursuant to OCGA § 34-9-15\\n\\n(b).1\\n\\n        The stipulation of settlement memorialized Hayes’s position that he “sustained\\n\\na compensable injury” to his hips, legs, and back due to the accident, which arose out\\n\\nof and within the course of his employment; as well as Waldrop’s rejection of Hayes’s\\n\\nposition. The stipulation further provided: “In order to avoid litigation in\\n\\nthis matter, the parties hereto stipulate and agree that [Hayes] did not sustain an\\n\\naccident and injury while employed with [Waldrop] and that all compensation benefits\\n\\nshould be denied.” The State Board of Workers’ Compensation (“the Board”)\\n\\napproved the stipulation, as required by OCGA § 34-9-15 (b).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        1\\n            OCGA § 34-9-15 (b) provides, in pertinent part:\\n\\n        The board shall be authorized to approve a stipulated settlement between\\n        the parties which concludes that there is no liability under this chapter\\n        and to retain jurisdiction to enforce any agreement which resolves, in\\n        whole or in part, a claim filed with the board. . . . When such settlement\\n        has been agreed upon and approved by the board, it shall constitute a\\n        complete and final disposition of all claims on account of the incident,\\n        injury, or injuries referred to therein[.]\\n                                             3\\n       A separate release provided that Waldrop would pay Hayes $45,000 upon the\\n\\nBoard’s denial of his claim per the stipulation. The release again referenced Hayes’s\\n\\nallegation that he “sustained compensable injuries . . . arising out of and within the\\n\\ncourse of” his employment with Waldrop. And, it declared the parties’ intention to\\n\\nrelease Waldrop “from any and all liability whatsoever arising out of the employment\\n\\nrelationship between [it and Hayes] under the workers’ compensation laws of the\\n\\nState of Georgia, as well as any other claim that might arise out of the alleged\\n\\naccident” in any action or forum. Upon the Board’s approval of the stipulation,\\n\\nWaldrop paid Hayes in accordance with the release.2\\n\\n      Thereafter, Hayes filed the subject negligence action against KSP and Gardner.\\n\\nThe Defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming that Hayes was judicially\\n\\nestopped from bringing the negligence action because, in resolving his prior workers’\\n\\ncompensation claim, he stipulated that he had not been injured. The Defendants also\\n\\nmoved for sanctions under Rule 37 based on Hayes’s alleged attempt to conceal his\\n\\nworkers’ compensation settlement.\\n\\n      2\\n        Hayes’s and Waldrop’s handling of the stipulation and release appears to be\\nstandard practice in the field. See James B. Hiers, Jr., Robert R. Potter and Todd A.\\nBrooks, Ga. Workers’ Compensation Law and Practice, § 30:3 (2023); see also O’Neal\\nv. Cincinnati Ins. Co., \\n169 Ga. App. 483\\n (\\n313 SE2d 501\\n) (1984).\\n                                          4\\n       The trial court granted the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment,\\n\\nconcluding that Hayes was judicially estopped from bringing the present action as a\\n\\nresult of his seemingly contradictory representations in his workers’ compensation\\n\\ncase. The trial court denied the Defendants’ Rule 37 motion, finding that sanctions\\n\\nwere not warranted. These appeals followed.\\n\\n                                Case No. A24A0361\\n\\n      1. Hayes contends that the trial court erred in granting the Defendants’ motion\\n\\nfor summary judgment because it misapplied the judicial estoppel doctrine and\\n\\nmisconstrued statutorily-defined terms in his workers’ compensation settlement\\n\\ndocuments. We agree.\\n\\n      The trial court barred Hayes’s negligence claims under the federal doctrine of\\n\\njudicial estoppel, which “precludes a party from asserting a position in one judicial\\n\\nproceeding after having successfully asserted a contrary position in a prior\\n\\nproceeding.” (Citation omitted.)

Tideback, \\n359\\n\\nGa. App. 295\\n, 296-297 (2) (\\n857 SE2d 276\\n) (2021). We review a trial court’s decision\\n\\nto apply the judicial estoppel doctrine for an abuse of discretion. Greenlee, 359 Ga.\\n\\nApp. at 296 (2).\\n\\n      Broadly viewed, the question raised in this appeal is whether a “no liability”\\n\\nsettlement between an employee and employer under the auspices of the Workers’\\n\\nCompensation Act bars the employee from then bringing tort claims arising out of the\\n\\nsame accident against a third-party tortfeasor.3 It does not.\\n\\n      The Act, itself, contemplates this very scenario, and provides, generally: “No\\n\\nemployee shall be deprived of any right to bring an action against any third-party tort-\\n\\n\\n\\n      3\\n        Our Supreme Court has clarified that a settlement with an employer pursuant\\nto OCGA § 34-9-15 (b) also bars claims against coworkers acting in their employment\\ncapacity. Smith v. Ellis, \\n291 Ga. 566\\n, 573 (2) (e), 578 (3) (e) (\\n731 SE2d 731\\n) (2012); see\\nalso Ridley v. Monroe, \\n256 Ga. App. 686\\n, 688-689 (\\n569 SE2d 561\\n) (2002). Here, there\\nare no allegations that Gardner was Hayes’s coworker or that KSP was affiliated with\\nWaldrop.\\n                                            6\\n feasor[.]”4 OCGA § 34-9-11 (a); see also Smith v.

Similarly, OCGA § 34-9-11.1 provides: “When the injury or death for\\n\\nwhich compensation is payable under this chapter is caused under circumstances\\n\\ncreating a legal liability against some person other than the employer, the injured\\n\\nemployee . . . may pursue the remedy by proper action in a court of competent\\n\\njurisdiction against such other persons[.]” See also Bush v.

As\\n\\nsuch, the applicable statutes expressly permit Hayes’s negligence claims.\\n\\n      Moreover, the underlying purposes of the judicial estoppel doctrine are not met\\n\\nhere. As we have explained,\\n\\n      [t]he essential function and justification of judicial estoppel is to prevent\\n      the use of intentional self-contradiction as a means of obtaining unfair\\n      advantage in a forum provided for suitors seeking justice. The primary\\n      purpose of the doctrine is not to protect the litigants, but to protect the\\n      integrity of the judiciary. The doctrine is directed against those who\\n      would attempt to manipulate the court system through the calculated\\n      assertion of divergent sworn positions in judicial proceedings and is\\n      designed to prevent parties from making a mockery of justice through\\n      inconsistent pleadings.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.)

Because Hayes’s\\n\\nnegligence claims are permitted by law, as explained above, the integrity of the judicial\\n\\nsystem is not compromised. Additionally, the Act grants an employer a subrogation\\n\\nright against a remedy recovered from a third-party tortfeasor under certain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           8\\n circumstances; thus, allaying any concerns regarding unfair advantage or double-\\n\\ndipping. OCGA § 34-9-11.1 (b), (c); see generally Bush, 361 Ga. App. at 476 (A).\\n\\n      Finally, the trial court construed the stipulation and release too broadly.\\n\\nSpecifically, the trial court found: “In settling his workers’ compensation claim,\\n\\nPlaintiff stipulated that he was not injured in the underlying accident and even\\n\\nasserted he was not involved in an accident while in the course and scope of his\\n\\nemployment with Waldrop.” To the contrary, both the stipulation and release\\n\\nexpressly concede that Hayes alleged he sustained a “compensable injury” due to an\\n\\naccident in the course and scope of employment; and both provide that the\\n\\nrelinquishment of his workers’ compensation claims arising from that injury was solely\\n\\nfor the purpose of settlement with Waldrop under the terms of the Act. See CLS\\n\\nEntertainment v. Kenkam, LLC, \\n370 Ga. App. 810\\n, 815 (1) (\\n899 SE2d 343\\n) (2024)\\n\\n(“Where the language of a contract is plain and unambiguous, courts are not at liberty\\n\\nto ignore the specific terms of the parties’ written agreement and rewrite or revise a\\n\\ncontract under the guise of construing it.”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\nMoreover, the term “injury” is narrowly defined by the Act. In the confines of a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          9\\n workers’ compensation claim, it “means only injury by accident arising out of and in\\n\\nthe course of the employment[.]” OCGA § 34-9-1 (4).\\n\\n      Simply put, these documents do not serve as an admission that Hayes suffered\\n\\nno injury, nor can they be construed as a waiver of any claims arising from the accident\\n\\nagainst any party other than his employer. See Smith, \\n291 Ga. at 573\\n (2) (e); Bush, 361\\n\\nGa. App. at 476 (A); OCGA § 34-9-11 (a).\\n\\n      For all these reasons, the trial court erred in concluding the judicial estoppel\\n\\ndoctrine precluded the present action, and we reverse its grant of summary judgment\\n\\nto the Defendants.\\n\\n                           Case No. A24A0362\\n\\n      2. The Defendants argue that the trial court abused its discretion by denying\\n\\ntheir request for sanctions under OCGA § 9-11-37 because Hayes intentionally\\n\\nconcealed the settlement documents addressed above. We disagree.\\n\\n      As we have explained,\\n\\n\\n       [p]rovided proper discovery procedures are followed, when a party . . .\\n      after appropriate service fails to respond to document requests, a trial\\n      court may take any action delineated under OCGA § 9-11-37 (b) (2) (A)-\\n      (C). Among several other options, subsection (b) (2) (C) authorizes a\\n\\n\\n                                          10\\n       court to enter an order “dismissing the action or proceeding or any part\\n      thereof.” OCGA § 9-11-37 (b) (2) (C). Moreover, an order compelling\\n      discovery is not a condition precedent for the imposition of sanctions\\n      under subsection (d). All that is required is a motion, notice, and a\\n      hearing.5\\n\\n\\n(Citations omitted.) Taylor v. Marshall, \\n321 Ga. App. 752\\n, 753-754 (\\n743 SE2d 444\\n)\\n\\n(2013).

IN RE: ESTATE OF MABLE JOHNSON REESE, DECEASED.\\n\\n      In this probate matter, Donald E. Reese, Sr., filed a petition for review in\\nsuperior court, seeking review of a probate court order removing him as the executor\\nof an estate. The superior court dismissed Reese’s petition for review as untimely on\\nApril 4, 2024. Reese filed a motion for reconsideration on April 16, 2024, which the\\ntrial court denied on May 8, 2024. On June 8, 2024, Reese filed an application with\\nthis Court for discretionary review. We, however, lack jurisdiction because the\\napplication is untimely\\n      To be timely, a discretionary application must be filed within 30 days of entry\\nof the order sought to be appealed. OCGA § 5-6-35 (d). The requirements of OCGA\\n§ 5-6-35 are jurisdictional, and this Court cannot accept an application for appeal not\\nmade in compliance therewith. Boyle v. State, \\n190 Ga.

Reese’s application was filed 65 days after the entry of the April 4, 2024 order\\ndismissing his petition for review, and is therefore untimely.\\n      Although Reese filed a motion for reconsideration within 30 days of the entry\\nof the April 4, 2024 order, the filing of a motion for reconsideration does not extend\\nthe time for filing a discretionary application for appeal, and the denial of a motion for\\nreconsideration of an appealable order or judgment is not itself appealable.

HEAD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        BOGGS, Chief Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Nicholas Bernard Head challenges his convictions\\n\\nfor malice murder and other crimes in connection with the shooting\\n\\ndeath of Quintavia Wade. Appellant contends that his rights under\\n\\nthe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United\\n\\nStates Constitution were violated when the State read into evidence\\n\\nprior testimony given about the murder weapon by Emily Bagwell,\\n\\nthe State’s firearms expert, and that the trial court committed plain\\n\\nerror in allowing another firearms examiner, Kyle Wheelus, to\\n\\ntestify as a “verifier” of Bagwell’s analysis about the bullet recovered\\n\\nin Wade’s autopsy. We conclude that, even assuming that there was\\n\\nerror with regard to the admission of Bagwell’s prior testimony\\n\\nabout the murder weapon, any error was harmless beyond a\\n reasonable doubt given the overwhelming evidence against\\n\\nAppellant, including the testimony of two police officers who\\n\\nwitnessed the shooting. Additionally, because Wheelus’s testimony\\n\\nwas based on his own ballistics analysis, there was no plain error in\\n\\nallowing his testimony. Accordingly, we affirm. 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 Wade was killed on October 16, 2017. On June 26, 2018, a Clarke\\nCounty grand jury indicted Appellant for malice murder and other crimes in\\nconnection with Wade’s death. That indictment was nolle prossed. On April 13,\\n2021, a Clarke County grand jury indicted Appellant for the following crimes\\nrelated to the death of Wade: malice murder, three counts of felony murder,\\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon, false imprisonment, possession of a\\nfirearm during the commission of a felony, and two counts of possession of a\\nfirearm by a first offender probationer. It also indicted Appellant for an earlier\\naggravated assault and simple battery against Courtney Williams. One felony\\nmurder count was quashed, and at a trial from August 9-12, 2021, the jury\\nacquitted Appellant of the counts involving Williams and found him guilty on\\nall remaining counts. The trial court sentenced Appellant to serve life in prison\\nwith the possibility of parole for malice murder and consecutive terms of\\nimprisonment totaling fifteen years for two of the weapons charges. The felony\\nmurder verdicts were vacated by operation of law, and the trial court merged\\nthe other counts for sentencing. See Dixon v. State, 302 Ga. 691, 696-698 (808\\nSE2d 696) (2017). On August 16, 2021, Appellant filed a motion for new trial,\\nwhich he amended with new counsel on October 4, 2022. After an evidentiary\\nhearing on November 2, 2022, the trial court entered an order denying the\\nmotion on May 5, 2023. The trial court twice vacated and reentered the order\\ndenying the motion for new trial (once because the order was not served on\\nAppellant’s counsel and once for a technical glitch with an e-filing system), and\\nAppellant filed a timely notice of appeal. The case was docketed in this Court\\nto the term beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the\\nbriefs.\\n                                        2\\n      1.     The evidence presented at trial showed the following. 2 On\\n\\nOctober 16, 2017, Appellant’s former girlfriend, Courtney Williams,\\n\\nwent to retrieve some of her clothes from the home that she and\\n\\nAppellant formerly shared. Her friend Wade was with her, though\\n\\nWilliams and Wade drove separately. Williams was scared to be\\n\\naround Appellant, and when she arrived at the home, she thought\\n\\nshe saw someone inside the house by the window. Believing\\n\\nAppellant to be there, she drove away and called 911. Officers\\n\\nresponded and while an officer was standing next to Williams,\\n\\nWilliams answered a call from Appellant. The officer spoke loudly\\n\\nand said that if Appellant was in the house, he needed to come out\\n\\nand talk to the officers. Appellant told Williams he was not in the\\n\\nhouse, and officers later confirmed that fact. After receiving\\n\\ninformation from the officer about how to obtain a temporary\\n\\nprotective order, Williams and Wade went to the courthouse in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     2 Because of the harmless error analysis undertaken in Division 2, we\\n\\nset out the evidence in detail rather than recounting it in the light most\\nfavorable to the jury’s verdict. See Moore v. State, 315 Ga. 263, 264 n.2 (882\\nSE2d 227) (2022).\\n                                      3\\n Wade’s car, but Williams did not have her ID and could not apply for\\n\\nthe TPO. Wade then drove Williams back to Williams’s home, and\\n\\nwhile en route, Wade received a call from someone named Jeff who\\n\\nasked for a ride. After picking up Jeff, Wade dropped Williams back\\n\\noff at Williams’s home.\\n\\n     Later that afternoon, after Wade had returned to her own\\n\\napartment, Appellant arrived at Wade’s apartment. Yasmeen\\n\\nWhite, Wade’s friend and co-worker, arrived at Wade’s apartment\\n\\nsometime after Appellant arrived. White parked her car on the\\n\\nstreet, and when she exited her car, she saw Appellant and Wade\\n\\noutside the apartment on the back patio, which faced the street.\\n\\nAppellant was pushing Wade against the apartment wall, and as\\n\\nWhite walked toward the back patio, Appellant said “what’s up,\\n\\nYas?” White entered the apartment through the back patio door and\\n\\nsaw that Appellant had a pistol in his back pocket. White heard\\n\\nAppellant tell Wade that he wanted Wade to call Williams and tell\\n\\nWilliams to come to the apartment. Wade said that she could not\\n\\ncall Williams because Appellant had her phone, and Appellant told\\n\\n                                 4\\n Wade to use White’s phone. White gave her phone to Wade. Wade\\n\\ncalled Williams and told her that Appellant had “ripped her bra, and\\n\\nput a gun to her head”; that Appellant “was going to kill her” if\\n\\nWilliams did not come to Wade’s apartment; and that if the police\\n\\ncame, Appellant was going to shoot Wade. Wade gave the phone\\n\\nback to White, and White saw that Wade had typed “911” on the\\n\\nkeypad and understood from Wade’s nod of her head that Wade\\n\\nwanted White to call 911 without alerting Appellant. White went\\n\\ninside a closet, called 911, and told the operator that a man had a\\n\\ngun and was threatening to kill Wade. After the phone call between\\n\\nWilliams and Wade ended, Williams also called 911 and reported\\n\\nthat Appellant was at Wade’s apartment and was threatening to kill\\n\\nher. The jury heard both 911 calls.\\n\\n     Officers Shawn Denmark and Edward Herron, both of the\\n\\nAthens-Clarke County Police Department, responded to the 911\\n\\ncalls. As they arrived, they saw Appellant and Wade on the back\\n\\npatio. Officer Herron testified that his initial thought was that\\n\\nAppellant and Wade “were playing.” However, he then saw Wade\\n\\n                                 5\\n walking backward while Appellant had “something like a gun in his\\n\\nhand,” and he observed Wade “swatting at” Appellant to “redirect . .\\n\\n. or swing at his arms.” Wade’s hands were open, and she did not hit\\n\\nthe gun or ever gain control of the gun. He saw Appellant shoot\\n\\nWade, and in response, Officer Herron fired his service weapon, a\\n\\nnine-millimeter Glock, in the direction of the back patio. Appellant\\n\\nwas not hit and retreated into the apartment. Appellant then\\n\\nstepped back onto the patio with one foot but remained partially out\\n\\nof view. Officer Herron repeatedly told Appellant to drop the gun\\n\\nand put his hands up. Appellant did not comply. Instead, he yelled\\n\\nsomething indistinguishable at the officers, and then shot himself in\\n\\nthe face. After Appellant shot himself, the gun he was holding\\n\\ndischarged again. As Appellant fell to the ground, he appeared to\\n\\nfall on top of the gun. 3\\n\\n     The State played body camera footage from Officer Herron,\\n\\nalthough the recording does not show what happened on the back\\n\\n\\n     3 The trial testimony does not make clear whether Appellant fired the\\n\\ngun again after shooting himself and then dropped it or whether he dropped\\nthe gun after shooting himself and the gun discharged accidentally.\\n                                    6\\n patio. However, the recording included Officer Herron’s statements\\n\\nover his radio and to other officers describing the shooting moments\\n\\nafter it occurred. Officer Herron first said, “I shot off three rounds\\n\\nafter he shot her.” Shortly thereafter, Officer Herron said that “the\\n\\nmale shot the female” as Officer Herron was getting out of the car\\n\\nand that they were “tussling over the gun; he shot himself when I\\n\\ntold him to get on the ground.” Officer Herron acknowledged during\\n\\nhis testimony that in a use-of-force investigation with GBI agents\\n\\nthat occurred the same day as the shooting, he said that he never\\n\\nactually saw a gun and that he was not able to see Wade’s head\\n\\nclearly for part of the time. 4\\n\\n      Officer Denmark testified that he saw Appellant shoot Wade in\\n\\nthe head. He described Appellant and Wade as being in a “physical\\n\\naltercation,” with Appellant walking backward, with his left hand\\n\\non Wade’s right shoulder, dragging Wade onto the patio and holding\\n\\nher in a “bent over” position. Officer Denmark acknowledged that in\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 A portion of Officer Herron’s interview with GBI agents was played for\\n\\nthe jury, but the record does not indicate precisely which portion was played.\\n                                      7\\n prior testimony, he said that he was not looking directly at\\n\\nAppellant and Wade. Officer Wang of the Athens-Clarke County\\n\\nPolice Department was the first officer to approach the patio after\\n\\nAppellant shot himself; Appellant and Wade were both lying on the\\n\\nground. The gun was not visible at first, but when Officer Wang\\n\\nstepped close to Appellant’s shoulder, Officer Wang saw the gun\\n\\n“right beside [Appellant] on the other side of his body.” Officer Wang\\n\\npicked up the gun, which was a Taurus nine-millimeter handgun.\\n\\nAppellant was arrested and taken to a hospital, where he recovered\\n\\nfrom the self-inflicted gunshot wound.\\n\\n     The medical examiner who conducted Wade’s autopsy\\n\\nrecovered several parts of a bullet from Wade’s head and concluded\\n\\nthat the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the top of\\n\\nWade’s head. The medical examiner also examined Wade’s hands\\n\\nand found no evidence of defensive wounds or bruises or scrapes on\\n\\nher hands.\\n\\n     GBI firearms examiner Emily Bagwell, whose testimony from\\n\\na prior probation revocation hearing was read into evidence at trial\\n\\n                                  8\\n by the State, served as the primary firearms examiner in this case.\\n\\nIn that capacity, she examined the bullet that the medical examiner\\n\\nextracted from Wade’s head. She also examined and test-fired the\\n\\nTaurus nine-millimeter handgun that Officer Wang found next to\\n\\nAppellant. Bagwell concluded that the bullet recovered during\\n\\nWade’s autopsy was shot from the Taurus handgun and that the\\n\\nbullet could not have been fired from a Glock handgun. She also\\n\\nconducted a trigger pull test and concluded that the Taurus did not\\n\\nhave a “hair trigger,” which she described as a “very light trigger” or\\n\\none that will fire with around one pound of pressure or less. She\\n\\nconcluded that the Taurus would need a pull force of at least four\\n\\nand one-half pounds to fire; she did not conduct a test to see if the\\n\\ngun would fire if dropped. She explained that to fire the gun, a\\n\\nperson would have to pull backward on the slide to load a cartridge\\n\\ninto the chamber and then pull the trigger.\\n\\n     After Bagwell completed her examination of the bullet and the\\n\\nTaurus, GBI firearms examiner Kyle Wheelus performed the next\\n\\nstage of the GBI’s standard examination, which involved serving as\\n\\n                                  9\\n a “verifier” of some of Bagwell’s findings. Wheelus testified at trial\\n\\nthat he used a microscope to examine the bullet received from the\\n\\nmedical examiner and concluded that the bullet could not have been\\n\\nfired from a Glock and could have been fired from a nine-millimeter\\n\\ngun made by one of seven manufacturers, including Taurus.\\n\\nWheelus did not determine whether the bullet was fired from the\\n\\nTaurus recovered at the scene and did not test or fire the Taurus.\\n\\nMark Tanner, a firearms examiner with the GBI, also served as a\\n\\n“verifier” and testified at trial. He compared the bullet from the\\n\\nautopsy and a bullet that was test-fired from the Taurus and\\n\\nconcluded that the bullet recovered in the autopsy was fired from\\n\\nthe Taurus. Tanner did not examine the Taurus.\\n\\n     Appellant did not testify at trial, and his counsel argued for an\\n\\nacquittal based on accident. In opening arguments, Appellant’s\\n\\ncounsel told the jury that Appellant did not bring a gun to the\\n\\napartment; that the gun was already at the apartment and was\\n\\nlikely left there by “Jeff,” the man to whom Wade had given a ride;\\n\\nand that Wade picked up the gun, Appellant “grabbed for” the gun\\n\\n                                 10\\n because he wanted her to put it away, they wrestled over it, and the\\n\\ngun went off. In closing arguments, Appellant’s counsel again\\n\\nargued that Appellant did not bring a gun to the apartment; that\\n\\nAppellant “was one of two people tussling over the gun”; that the\\n\\ngun went off when Wade had her hands on it; and that Appellant\\n\\nwas “grabbing at [Wade] trying to push the gun away.” The jury was\\n\\ncharged that if it found “that the incident . . . occurred as a result of\\n\\nmisfortune or accident and not as a result of a criminal undertaking\\n\\nor criminal negligence, then it would be your duty to acquit the\\n\\nDefendant.”\\n\\n     2.    Appellant contends that the admission of Bagwell’s prior\\n\\ntestimony about the Taurus handgun — that it did not have a “hair\\n\\ntrigger” and that it required at least four and a half pounds of\\n\\npressure to fire — violated his rights under the Confrontation\\n\\nClause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\n\\nSee Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 54 (124 SCt 1354, 158\\n\\nLE2d 177) (2004) (Confrontation Clause prohibits the introduction\\n\\nof testimonial statements by a nontestifying witness, unless the\\n\\n                                   11\\n witness is “unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior\\n\\nopportunity for cross-examination.”). As noted above, Appellant\\n\\nasserted a defense of accident, relying on Officer Herron’s\\n\\nstatements that he initially believed Appellant and Wade were\\n\\nplaying and that he saw them “tussling” over the gun. Appellant\\n\\ncontends that the error in admitting Bagwell’s testimony was\\n\\nharmful because the “trigger pull” testimony allowed the jury to\\n\\nreject his accident theory. The State argues that Appellant failed to\\n\\npreserve this claim for ordinary appellate review because he did not\\n\\nspecifically rely on the Confrontation Clause in any of his objections\\n\\nat the pretrial hearing or at trial and that regardless, any error was\\n\\nharmless. As explained below, we assume, without deciding, that\\n\\nthe claim was preserved and that there was error, but we conclude\\n\\nthat any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n     At a pretrial hearing on August 3, 2021, approximately one\\n\\nweek before trial, the State indicated for the first time that it\\n\\nintended to read into evidence at trial Bagwell’s testimony from\\n\\nAppellant’s probation revocation hearing, which took place\\n\\n                                 12\\n approximately three years earlier.5 The prosecutor informed the\\n\\ntrial court that on July 22, 2021, his office tried to subpoena Bagwell\\n\\nby email and received an automated response stating that Bagwell\\n\\nwas “not available.” After contacting a GBI manager, the prosecutor\\n\\nlearned that Bagwell began maternity leave in early July and would\\n\\nnot return until October 1, 2021. Appellant objected, arguing, in\\n\\npart, that the State had not served Bagwell with a subpoena; that\\n\\nBagwell had not traveled out of the country; that maternity leave,\\n\\nby itself, did not constitute unavailability or inability to testify; and\\n\\nthat while Bagwell was subject to cross-examination at the prior\\n\\nhearing, counsel would have a different approach and strategy at\\n\\ntrial and that “the availability for cross-examination is not\\n\\nequivalent.” The trial court ruled that Bagwell was “unavailable”\\n\\nand that her prior testimony could be read into evidence at trial.\\n\\nPrior to Bagwell’s testimony being read at trial by an employee of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     5  At the time of the offenses against Wade, Appellant was serving a\\nsentence of probation under a first-offender plea. The probation revocation\\npetition sought to revoke Appellant’s first-offender status based on his\\ncommission of the offenses against Wade.\\n                                    13\\n the District Attorney’s office, Appellant renewed his prior objection.\\n\\n     We assume, without deciding, that Appellant sufficiently\\n\\npreserved his Confrontation Clause objection for ordinary appellate\\n\\nreview. Compare OCGA § 24-1-103 (a) (1) (Party challenging\\n\\nadmission of evidence must state “specific ground of objection, if the\\n\\nspecific ground was not apparent from the context[.]”); Durham v.\\n\\nState, 296 Ga. 376, 379 (768 SE2d 512) (2015) (noting “distinct\\n\\ndifference” between hearsay and Confrontation Clause objections to\\n\\nadmission of evidence), disapproved of on other grounds, Leonard v.\\n\\nState, 316 Ga. 827, 835 n.6 (889 SE2d 837) (2023). Nevertheless, we\\n\\nneed not resolve whether the State met its burden to show that\\n\\nBagwell was unavailable and whether the admission of Bagwell’s\\n\\nprior testimony violated Appellant’s right of confrontation. See Ohio\\n\\nv. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 74-75 (100 SCt 2531, 65 LE2d 597) (1980)\\n\\n(prosecution bears burden of establishing whether witness is\\n\\nunavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes), overruled on other\\n\\ngrounds, Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60-69. See also State v. Hamilton,\\n\\n308 Ga. 116, 121-122 (839 SE2d 560) (2020) (proponent of hearsay\\n\\n                                 14\\n evidence of “unavailable” witness under OCGA § 24-8-804 bears the\\n\\nburden of proving unavailability). Even an error of constitutional\\n\\ndimension, such as the denial of the right of confrontation, may be\\n\\nharmless if “the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the\\n\\nerror did not contribute to the verdict, such as . . . when the evidence\\n\\nagainst the defendant is overwhelming.” Jones v. State, 314 Ga. 605,\\n\\n616 (878 SE2d 505) (2022) (cleaned up).\\n\\n     Here, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\\n\\nbecause the evidence was overwhelming. As noted above, the jury\\n\\nwas charged on Appellant’s theory that the shooting was an\\n\\naccident. See OCGA § 16-2-2 (“A person shall not be found guilty of\\n\\nany crime committed by misfortune or accident where it\\n\\nsatisfactorily appears there was no criminal scheme or undertaking,\\n\\nintention, or criminal negligence.”). The jury also heard Appellant’s\\n\\ntheory of accident in opening and closing arguments. However, the\\n\\nevidence that Appellant intentionally shot Wade was overwhelming.\\n\\nWhite testified that when she first saw Appellant and Wade,\\n\\nAppellant was pushing Wade against the apartment wall, and White\\n\\n                                  15\\n saw a gun in Appellant’s back pocket. White and Williams both\\n\\ntestified about Appellant’s threats to shoot Wade, and the jury heard\\n\\n911 calls detailing those threats. Minutes after the 911 calls,\\n\\nAppellant pulled or pushed Wade on to the patio, forcing her to bend\\n\\nover. Officers Herron and Denmark both testified that they saw\\n\\nAppellant shoot Wade. The jury also heard Officer Herron’s\\n\\nstatements moments after the fatal shooting in which he said that\\n\\nAppellant shot Wade. Officer Herron further testified that he could\\n\\nsee Wade’s hands, which were open and were not on the gun. This\\n\\ntestimony contradicted Appellant’s theory that the shooting was an\\n\\naccident that occurred during the struggle over the gun. Moreover,\\n\\nthe jury heard the medical examiner’s testimony that the bullet\\n\\nentered the top of Wade’s head and that Wade had no defensive\\n\\nwounds on her hands. Finally, the State did not reference Bagwell’s\\n\\n“trigger pull” testing on the Taurus in opening or closing arguments.\\n\\nReviewing this record de novo and weighing the evidence as a\\n\\nreasonable juror would, see Moore v. State, 315 Ga. 263, 271 (882\\n\\nSE2d 227) (2022), we conclude that the State has carried its burden\\n\\n                                 16\\n of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of\\n\\nBagwell’s prior testimony about the “trigger pull” of the murder\\n\\nweapon did not contribute to the verdict and thus that any error was\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Jones, 314 Ga. at 615-\\n\\n616 (pretermitting whether trial court erred in limiting cross-\\n\\nexamination of witness in violation of defendant’s right of\\n\\nconfrontation and concluding any error was harmless beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt in light of substantial evidence against the\\n\\ndefendant); Soto v. State, 285 Ga. 367, 370-372 (677 SE2d 95) (2009)\\n\\n(error in admitting out-of-court statement to police in violation of\\n\\nthe defendant’s right of confrontation was harmless beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt in light of overwhelming evidence against the\\n\\ndefendant).\\n\\n     3. Appellant contends that the trial court committed plain\\n\\nerror in allowing Wheelus to testify as a “verifier” of Bagwell’s\\n\\nballistics analysis. To show plain error, Appellant must identify an\\n\\nerror that was not affirmatively waived; that was clear and obvious\\n\\nbeyond reasonable dispute; that affected his substantial rights,\\n\\n                                 17\\n which generally requires an “affirmative showing” that the error\\n\\nprobably did affect the outcome below; and that the error seriously\\n\\naffected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\\n\\nproceedings. Ruthenberg v. State, 317 Ga. 227, 230-231 (892 SE2d\\n\\n728) (2023). We need not analyze all prongs of plain error review\\n\\nwhere appellant fails to establish one of them. See Williams v. State,\\n\\n315 Ga. 490, 496 (883 SE2d 733) (2023).\\n\\n     Here, Appellant’s argument appears to be that Wheelus was\\n\\nmerely a “surrogate” for Bagwell and that his testimony was\\n\\ninadmissible because he did not examine the Taurus. See generally\\n\\nDisharoon v. State, 291 Ga. 45, 47-48 (727 SE2d 465) (2012)\\n\\n(discussing Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S. 647, 652 (131 SCt\\n\\n2705, 180 LE2d 610) (2011), and holding that expert with significant\\n\\npersonal connection to forensic test could testify in lieu of scientist\\n\\nwho actually conducted it). However, Appellant fails to recognize\\n\\nthat Wheelus performed his own analysis and testified about his\\n\\nown examination of the bullet received from the autopsy. Wheelus\\n\\ndid not testify, for example, about Bagwell’s “trigger pull” test.\\n\\n                                  18\\n Rather, based on his independent analysis, he concluded that the\\n\\nbullet could not have been fired from a Glock but could have been\\n\\nfired from a gun made by one of seven manufacturers, including\\n\\nTaurus. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Appellant has\\n\\nfailed to show trial court error, much less plain error, in permitting\\n\\nWheelus to testify about his own examination of the bullet recovered\\n\\nfrom the autopsy.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 19\\n '),\n",

IN THE MATTER OF DIANA Y. MCDONALD.\\n\\n        PER CURIAM.\\n\\n         This disciplinary matter is before the Court on the Report and\\n\\nRecommendation of the State Disciplinary Review Board, which\\n\\nrecommends that we adopt the Report and Recommendation of\\n\\nSpecial Master Delia T. Crouch. The Special Master recommended\\n\\ndisbarring Respondent Diana Y. McDonald for violations of Rules\\n\\n1.5 (a); 1.8 (e); 1.15 (I) (a), (c), and (d); 1.15 (II) (a) and (b); 4.1 (a);\\n\\n7.1 (a); 7.5 (a) and (d); and 8.4 (a) (4) of the Georgia Rules of\\n\\nProfessional Conduct (“GRPC”), see Bar Rule 4-102 (d).1 McDonald\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 The maximum penalty for a single violation of Rules 1.5 (a); 1.8 (e); and\\n\\n7.5 (a) and (d) is a public reprimand, while the maximum penalty for a single\\nviolation of Rules 1.15 (I) (a), (c), and (d); 1.15 (II) (a) and (b); 4.1 (a); and 7.1\\n(a) and 8.4 (a) (4) is disbarment.\\n filed general exceptions to the Review Board’s Report and\\n\\nRecommendation, arguing that disbarment is not the appropriate\\n\\ndiscipline. She also filed a document styled as a “Petition for\\n\\nVoluntary Retirement,” in which she requests that she be\\n\\n“transferred to retired status” in lieu of being disbarred. The Bar\\n\\nresponded to both filings. After consideration of the entire record in\\n\\nthis matter, we dismiss McDonald’s petition for voluntary discipline\\n\\nand order that she be disbarred for her violations of the Georgia\\n\\nRules of Professional Conduct.\\n\\n     Factual Summary\\n\\n     Although the record in this case is large and comprehensive,\\n\\nthe general facts are that McDonald, a solo practitioner who joined\\n\\nthe State Bar of Georgia in 1985, did business both as the McDonald\\n\\nLaw Group, LLC and Law Offices of Diana McDonald, LLC.2 She\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     2 McDonald admitted that she identified her firm as a “law group,” even\\n\\nthough she was a solo practitioner. She testified that, at one point, another\\nattorney had practiced with her, but that attorney left the firm in 2018. She\\ncontinued practicing as a “law group” through the events leading to this\\ndisciplinary matter, which occurred in 2019.\\n\\n                                     2\\n maintained IOLTA accounts at Wells Fargo Bank in the name of\\n\\nboth businesses.\\n\\n     In the course of her practice, McDonald provided legal advice\\n\\nto a client who purported to conduct deals wherein the client was to\\n\\nprovide goods or services to third parties in exchange for payment.\\n\\nAs early as 2017, McDonald agreed to act and did act as an escrow\\n\\nagent for several of those deals. Despite the facts that none of the\\n\\nclient’s deals seemed to close smoothly and that the third parties in\\n\\nmost, if not all, of those deals complained to McDonald about not\\n\\nreceiving the promised goods or services, McDonald again agreed in\\n\\nearly 2019 to act as the escrow agent in a deal wherein her client\\n\\nand his associate promised to sell 1,000 Bitcoin to a third party\\n\\nthrough intermediary companies.3\\n\\n     On January 3, 2019, the third party in this deal transferred\\n\\n$4,000,000 into one of McDonald’s IOLTA accounts with the\\n\\nunderstanding that it would be held in escrow and not released until\\n\\n\\n     3 The agreement appeared to contemplate the exchange of up to 1,500\\n\\nBitcoin in several tranches, with the first tranche of 1,000 Bitcoin to be\\ndelivered on January 4, 2019.\\n\\n                                    3\\n the promised Bitcoin was confirmed to be in the third party’s “digital\\n\\nwallet”—an event which all parties expected to occur quickly, but\\n\\nwhich all parties now agree never happened. Several days later,\\n\\nafter no Bitcoin was delivered, the third party, through its attorney,\\n\\nreached out via email to McDonald, demanding return of its funds.\\n\\nIn responding to the third party over the next several days,\\n\\nMcDonald first encouraged it to provide her client with additional\\n\\ntime to deliver the Bitcoin, assuring the third party that her past\\n\\nexperiences with her client gave her faith that her client would\\n\\ndeliver, but that, if he did not do so, she would commence the process\\n\\nof transferring the third party’s escrowed funds back to it on\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2019.\\n\\n     Then, on January 9, 2019, after the third party again\\n\\ndemanded return of its $4,000,000, McDonald informed the third\\n\\nparty that she had received confirmation from her client that the\\n\\nBitcoin would be delivered “before the end of business today”;\\n\\nrepresented that, “[a]s a gesture of good faith and recognition for the\\n\\ndelay,” she had negotiated with her client to deliver 2,000 Bitcoin,\\n\\n                                  4\\n instead of the 1,000 for which the third party had paid; and assured\\n\\nthe third party that its funds were “safe and protected.” In mid-\\n\\nJanuary, the State Bar became involved at the third party’s request\\n\\nin trying to obtain assurances from McDonald that she still had the\\n\\n$4,000,000 in her IOLTA account. McDonald advised the Bar that\\n\\nher client represented to her that he had sent the Bitcoin, and that\\n\\nhe needed time to investigate why the Bitcoin had not shown up in\\n\\nthe third party’s digital wallet. She assured the Bar that the matter\\n\\nwould be resolved by the end of the business day on January 15 and\\n\\nthat “the funds [we]re safe.” The Bar responded to McDonald\\n\\ninforming her that it was relieved to hear that “the money was still\\n\\nsafely in [her] trust account,” and reminding her of her fiduciary\\n\\nduties under Rule 1.15 (I).4\\n\\n      On January 18, 2019, the third party filed a formal grievance\\n\\nagainst McDonald with the Bar, and the Bar forwarded it to her by\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 McDonald took no steps to correct the Bar’s mistaken belief that the\\n\\nfunds were still in her trust account. She later admitted that she did not do so\\nbecause she did not want to lie to the Bar and knew that if she told the truth,\\nthings would “kind of blow up.”\\n\\n                                       5\\n email, asking directly whether the $4,000,000 was still in her IOLTA\\n\\naccount.5 McDonald did not respond to the Bar’s email, but, on\\n\\nJanuary 18, she wired $2,000,000 to the third party. The rest of the\\n\\nmoney, however, would not be transferred because, as it turns out,\\n\\nMcDonald had begun transferring the third party’s money out of her\\n\\nIOLTA account to different recipients on the same day she received\\n\\nit. By January 7, when she assured the third party that its funds\\n\\nwere “safe and protected,” she had already disbursed approximately\\n\\n$2,000,000 of the third party’s funds out of her IOLTA account to\\n\\nherself and others unaffiliated with this transaction. In fact,\\n\\nalthough the third party never authorized the transfer or\\n\\ndisbursement of any of its funds except upon conclusion of the deal,\\n\\nand although McDonald never notified the third party of her\\n\\nintention to transfer any of its money out of her account, on January\\n\\n\\n\\n     5 That grievance led to the issuance of a Formal Complaint, see Bar Rule\\n\\n4-211, which was properly served on McDonald and timely answered by her.\\nAfter a lengthy discovery period, the Bar moved for summary judgment, which\\nwas granted as to the violations still at issue in this matter. A hearing on\\naggravating and mitigating factors was held, after which the Special Master\\nentered the Report and Recommendation addressed herein.\\n\\n                                     6\\n 3 and 4, McDonald transferred $415,000 to other accounts controlled\\n\\nby her; $25,000 to her sister; and $450,000 to parties involved in her\\n\\nclient’s earlier deals. In addition, she attempted to wire $1,200,000\\n\\nto a Chinese bank, but those wires were not accepted. On January\\n\\n7, the same day she assured the third party’s attorney that the\\n\\nmoney was “safe and protected,” she wired $800,000 to a corporation\\n\\nher client allegedly told her was its U.S. Bitcoin trader. McDonald\\n\\nasserted, during the underlying Bar proceedings, that each of these\\n\\ndisbursements of the third party’s money to herself and other\\n\\nindividuals and companies was authorized by her client. On\\n\\nFebruary 1, 2019, less than a month after it received the $2,000,000\\n\\nback from McDonald, the third party demanded an accounting of its\\n\\nremaining funds being held in escrow, but she never provided that\\n\\naccounting.\\n\\n     Unsatisfied with the return of only half of its money, the third\\n\\nparty filed a federal lawsuit against McDonald, her business\\n\\nentities, and various other parties on March 1, 2019, seeking an\\n\\nimmediate temporary restraining order, injunctive and equitable\\n\\n                                  7\\n relief, and compensatory and punitive damages. In connection with\\n\\nthis lawsuit, McDonald provided sworn testimony in which she\\n\\nadmitted that $440,000 of the third party’s money had already been\\n\\ntransferred to her operating accounts and to her personal accounts\\n\\n(and that of her sister), and explained her position that, even though\\n\\nher client never provided, and the third party never received, any\\n\\nBitcoin, she was entitled to those funds and more, as fees for her\\n\\nservices to her client. She also took the position that she did not need\\n\\nthe third party’s permission to distribute its funds to herself or any\\n\\nother entity, because she was doing so at her client’s direction and\\n\\nfor his benefit. Further, McDonald told the federal court that she\\n\\nintended to keep the fees if the court allowed her to do so.\\n\\n     But when the federal court determined that McDonald still had\\n\\n$310,000 left in two of her Wells Fargo IOLTA accounts, the court\\n\\ndirected her to transfer that amount back to the third party (which\\n\\nshe did), and the court issued an order restraining any future\\n\\ntransfer or spending of any money that was part of the third party’s\\n\\n$4,000,000. Later, it became clear that McDonald was continuing to\\n\\n                                   8\\n use the third party’s money to operate her business, so the federal\\n\\ncourt ordered McDonald to deposit all monies in any of her accounts\\n\\nthat could be traced back to the third party’s $4,000,000 into the\\n\\nregistry of the court. As a result, $104,200 was put into the court’s\\n\\nregistry and eventually returned to the third party. So, in the end,\\n\\nthe third party only recovered $2,414,200 of its $4,000,000 from\\n\\nMcDonald, with the remaining $1,585,800 having been retained by\\n\\nMcDonald and her family ($335,800) or paid out to various third\\n\\nparties seemingly unrelated to this Bitcoin transaction ($1,250,000).\\n\\nIt appears that more than $400,000 of the third party’s money was\\n\\nused to repay amounts McDonald owed to individuals or entities\\n\\nwho had previously deposited money into her IOLTA account to be\\n\\nheld in escrow in connection with her client’s earlier “deals,” but\\n\\nwhose funds had been distributed from her escrow account (in\\n\\nviolation of escrow agreements) despite the fact that the earlier\\n\\n“deals” had never closed.\\n\\n     From the third party’s funds that she retained, McDonald\\n\\nadmitted that she repaid money owed to friends and family, made\\n\\n                                  9\\n loans to other friends, contributed to charity, paid bills, and\\n\\npurchased goods and services for herself and her businesses. Some\\n\\nof these payments were made after the third party demanded return\\n\\nof its money. In one notable instance, on January 7, 2019, McDonald\\n\\npaid $5,644 to a bankruptcy trustee on behalf of an individual who\\n\\nwas McDonald’s client in a bankruptcy matter. McDonald explained\\n\\nthat she did so because that bankruptcy client did not have the\\n\\nmoney needed to make her Chapter 13 bankruptcy payment; that\\n\\nshe considered the payment a loan to a friend; and that she made an\\n\\nadditional $3,000 loan to that client on January 16, 2019, because\\n\\n“she [was] a personal friend . . . and a client.”\\n\\n      In addition, McDonald admitted that she paid approximately\\n\\n$11,650 to the trustee of the Chapter 13 proceeding of her husband.\\n\\nAnd, on March 6, 2019, McDonald used $90,000 of the third party’s\\n\\nmoney to pay a retainer to an attorney, who initially represented her\\n\\nin the third party’s federal lawsuit against her.6 McDonald admitted\\n\\n\\n      6 After it became clear that the third party’s money was the source of\\n\\nthat attorney’s retainer, the attorney alerted the parties to the federal suit and\\n\\n                                       10\\n that virtually all of the money she transferred to herself, her family\\n\\nmembers, and her friends during January and February of 2019\\n\\ncould be traced back to the third party’s $4,000,000, but she asserted\\n\\nthat she was entitled to use that money because she was owed fees\\n\\nfrom her client.7\\n\\n      During the disciplinary matter, McDonald finally admitted\\n\\nthat, in hindsight, the third party was the owner of the $4,000,000;\\n\\nthat she had received the money into her escrow account in a\\n\\n“fiduciary capacity”; that the third party’s money was in her\\n\\n“protective care”; that she owed a fiduciary duty to the third party\\n\\nwith regard to the funds on deposit with her; and that she “probably”\\n\\nknew as early as January 5, 2019 that the third party expected or\\n\\nunderstood that she was supposed to hold the money until the\\n\\nBitcoin had been delivered. She further agreed that the third party’s\\n\\n\\n\\nthose parties reached an agreement on March 25, 2019, pursuant to which the\\nattorney would return $60,000 of the retainer to the third party and keep the\\nremaining $30,000 to cover his defense of McDonald in the federal case to that\\npoint. The attorney withdrew as McDonald’s attorney in April 2019.\\n      7 Even in 2020, McDonald was still claiming that she was entitled to\\n\\nretain more than $200,000 of the third party’s money as fees for her services.\\n\\n                                      11\\n control of the money never terminated because performance of the\\n\\nagreed-upon conditions never happened; that all of the money\\n\\nshould have gone back to the third party as the deal never closed;\\n\\nthat she performed essentially no legal services beyond holding the\\n\\nfunds in her IOLTA account; that she was not authorized by the\\n\\nthird party to collect any fees or make any disbursements from its\\n\\nfunds, at least until the deal was consummated; and that she did not\\n\\nadvise anyone affiliated with the third party entity (or ask anyone\\n\\nthere for permission) before she distributed its money.\\n\\n     McDonald further admitted that she did not keep or maintain\\n\\na ledger or record of her IOLTA accounts, and that, unbeknownst to\\n\\nher at the time, her role with regard to her client had been to loan\\n\\nout her trust account to the perpetrators of what she now\\n\\nacknowledges to have been a scam. When asked to explain her\\n\\nassertions (made to the third party and to the Bar) that the third\\n\\nparty’s funds were “safe and protected” when much of the money had\\n\\nalready been spent, McDonald said that she saw no issue with\\n\\nmaking those statements because she “didn’t have any reason to\\n\\n                                 12\\n believe that [the funds] weren’t going to be returned if there was a\\n\\nproblem,” and that she honestly believed that her client would\\n\\ndeliver the Bitcoin to the third party’s digital wallet. She now admits\\n\\nthat, in hindsight, her assurance to the third party that the third\\n\\nparty’s funds were “safe and protected” was a false statement of\\n\\nmaterial fact.\\n\\n     The Special Master found as fact that, at the time the third\\n\\nparty wired the $4,000,000 into McDonald’s IOLTA account,\\n\\nMcDonald (1) “at minimum had reason to suspect that the deal\\n\\nwould fail to close merely based on its association with [her client],\\n\\nwhose numerous prior deals had failed to close”; (2) was trying to\\n\\ncollect enough money to pay back other parties “from whom she\\n\\nha[d] already received money into her trust account and disbursed”\\n\\ninappropriately at her client’s direction; and (3) was trying to protect\\n\\nherself insofar as she had already told her client that an individual\\n\\nwhose corporation was involved in one of the client’s earlier deals\\n\\nhad threatened to report her to the Bar if she failed to return his\\n\\ncorporation’s money. The Special Master further found that, prior to\\n\\n                                  13\\n the federal lawsuit, McDonald took no steps to pay any of the money\\n\\nshe appropriated back to the third party; that the third party settled\\n\\nits suit against McDonald on terms that provide only modest\\n\\nrecompense to it; and that it is uncertain if the third party has been\\n\\nmade whole by other defendants in the federal lawsuit.\\n\\n     Rule Violations\\n\\n          Rule 8.4 (a) (4) – False Statements\\n\\n     Based on the foregoing facts, the Special Master found that\\n\\nMcDonald violated Rule 8.4 (a) (4), which prohibits a lawyer from\\n\\nengaging “in professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit\\n\\nor misrepresentation,” when she misled the third party and its\\n\\nattorneys regarding the status of the $4,000,000 that it deposited in\\n\\nher IOLTA account. The Special Master concluded that McDonald’s\\n\\nassertions—to the effect that she did not perceive herself to be an\\n\\n“independent escrow agent”; that she did not understand her\\n\\nobligation to provide the third party with complete and truthful\\n\\ninformation about the delivery of the Bitcoin and the status of its\\n\\nfunds; and that she did not participate in any conduct “with the\\n\\n                                 14\\n intent” to mislead the third party—not only strained credulity, but\\n\\nwere irrelevant to the question because she intentionally made\\n\\nmultiple statements and promises to the third party and its agents\\n\\nabout the status of the transaction and their funds; those statements\\n\\nwere, at best, a deceitful artifice meant to string the third party\\n\\nalong or, at worst, demonstrably and objectively false when she\\n\\nmade them; and her statements were likely to, and did, mislead the\\n\\nthird party and its agents. See In the Matter of Woodham, 296 Ga.\\n\\n618, 625 (769 SE2d 353) (2015) (Rule 8.4 (a) (4) is meant to reach\\n\\n“conduct that is intended or likely to mislead another”); see also In\\n\\nthe Matter of Tuggle, 317 Ga. 255, 272 (892 SE2d 761) (2023).\\n\\n     Noting that facts can be established through circumstantial\\n\\nevidence, the Special Master pointed to McDonald’s “absurd [and]\\n\\nultimately false” promise on January 9, 2019—that she would send\\n\\nthe third party 2,000 Bitcoin (i.e., $8 million worth) instead of 1,000\\n\\nfor the same $4,000,000 the third party had already paid—as\\n\\nevidence of her intent to mislead the third party into backing off its\\n\\ndemand that she return the $4,000,000, much of which she no longer\\n\\n                                  15\\n had in her possession. The Special Master also highlighted\\n\\nMcDonald’s interaction with the Bar and specifically her failure to\\n\\ncorrect the Bar’s misunderstanding that “the funds were safely in\\n\\nher trust account” as additional circumstantial evidence of her\\n\\nduplicity. The Special Master concluded that the most telling\\n\\nevidence on the issue of McDonald’s duplicity and intent, however,\\n\\nwas found in her admission, during a deposition, that she had sent\\n\\nan email to her client on January 27, 2019 in which she pleaded with\\n\\nthem to make things right and stated, “I have lied to these people\\n\\n[i.e., the third party and the intermediary] so much in an effort to\\n\\nbuy myself some time. I do not like to lie and at some point it will\\n\\ncatch up with me.”\\n\\n     The Special Master found that this admission showed that\\n\\nMcDonald’s statements to the third party were not an error in\\n\\njudgment based on a misunderstanding of what it meant to be an\\n\\nindependent escrow agent, but were part of a series of deliberate\\n\\nmisrepresentations and deceits about the status of the third party’s\\n\\nfunds, intended by her to “buy herself some time” within which\\n\\n                                16\\n maybe her client would save her, perhaps with another “deal.” Thus,\\n\\nthe Special Master concluded that McDonald knowingly and\\n\\ndeliberately sought to delude and delay the third party for as long\\n\\nas she could; that she was not innocent or confused; and that she\\n\\nunderstood what she was doing.\\n\\n          Rule 8.4 (a) (4) – Conversion of Third Party’s Funds\\n\\n     The Special Master additionally concluded that McDonald\\n\\nviolated Rule 8.4 (a) (4) by stealing or converting the third party’s\\n\\nfunds to her own use. McDonald asserted that her use of the third\\n\\nparty’s funds was reasonable because her client authorized it, and\\n\\nbecause she was entitled to claim a portion of the funds as her fees.\\n\\nBut the Special Master rejected that assertion, pointing out that\\n\\nMcDonald had admitted to knowing that the $4,000,000 still\\n\\nbelonged to the third party because the promised Bitcoin had not\\n\\nbeen delivered, and knowing that the third party had not authorized\\n\\nthe disbursement of any of its funds.\\n\\n     The Special Master also discounted McDonald’s belief that her\\n\\nclient had authorized her to disburse the third party’s money, noting\\n\\n                                 17\\n that the record was devoid of evidence that anyone other than the\\n\\nthird party had the right of ownership over any of the money it\\n\\nentrusted to her. In rejecting McDonald’s argument that she did not\\n\\nact with the requisite mental culpability since she claimed to have\\n\\nno intent to deceive or defraud, the Special Master noted that the\\n\\ntransfers in this case did not happen as the result of negligence or\\n\\naccident; instead, McDonald intentionally caused the third party’s\\n\\nmoney to be transferred to the various recipients she intended to\\n\\nreceive it, and she did so without the third party’s permission and\\n\\nin hostility to its rights to the money.\\n\\n     Further, the Special Master found absurd McDonald’s claim\\n\\nthat her intent should be judged according to her allegedly “honest\\n\\nbelief” that she was entitled to take the third party’s money for\\n\\nherself without the third party’s permission or authority. The\\n\\nSpecial Master noted that, whatever McDonald said that she hoped\\n\\nwould ultimately happen with the Bitcoin transaction, she actually\\n\\nintended to, and did, convert $1,585,800 of the third party’s funds to\\n\\nher own purposes. Of the $1,585,800 that was never returned,\\n\\n                                   18\\n McDonald claimed $440,000 as a “fee” and the remaining sum was\\n\\ndisposed of for various other reasons. The Special Master also found\\n\\nthat McDonald’s belief that her client would make good on the\\n\\ntransaction did not deprive her of the capacity to intend the\\n\\nconsequences of her conversion of the third party’s funds.\\n\\n     For these reasons, the Special Master concluded that\\n\\nMcDonald violated Rule 8.4 (a) (4) and engaged in “professional\\n\\nconduct involving dishonesty” when she knowingly, intentionally,\\n\\nand wrongfully converted the third party’s funds. See In the Matter\\n\\nof West, 301 Ga. 901, 904 (804 SE2d 340) (2017) (noting that “[t]he\\n\\nBar concurs with the lawyer-defendant’s assertion that the\\n\\n‘dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation’ standard from Rule\\n\\n8.4 (a) (4) contains an implicit intent element”); but see In the Matter\\n\\nof Roberts, 284 Ga. 445, 446 (668 SE2d 256) (2008) (“[A] negligent\\n\\nmisrepresentation is sufficient for the imposition of discipline under\\n\\nRule 8.4 (a) (4).”).\\n\\n           Rule 4.1 (a) – False or Misleading Statements to a\\n           Third Party\\n\\n\\n                                  19\\n      Rule 4.1 (a) provides that a lawyer shall not, “[i]n the course of\\n\\nrepresenting a client . . . knowingly [] make false statements of\\n\\nmaterial fact or law to a third person.” The Special Master relied on\\n\\nthe same evidence she recited as to McDonald’s Rule 8.4 (a) (4)\\n\\nviolations to support her conclusion that McDonald knew her\\n\\nstatement related to the third party’s funds, specifically that those\\n\\nfunds were “safe and protected,” was objectively false at the time she\\n\\nmade it, notwithstanding her hope that her client might fulfill his\\n\\npromise to the third party or give her enough money to pay the third\\n\\nparty back its entire $4,000,000. Thus, the Special Master found\\n\\nthat McDonald knowingly violated Rule 4.1 (a) by misleading the\\n\\nthird party regarding the status of its $4,000,000.\\n\\n          Rule 1.5 (a) – Unreasonable Fee\\n\\n     With regard to the alleged violation of Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall\\n\\nnot make an agreement for or collect an unreasonable fee), the\\n\\nSpecial Master first noted that an excessively large fee can be per se\\n\\n“unreasonable” where little or no work was performed in exchange\\n\\nfor the fee. See In the Matter of Hardy, 316 Ga. 845, 850 (890 SE2d\\n\\n                                  20\\n 770) (2023) (Rule 1.5 (a) violation when attorney “collected and\\n\\nretained $1,500 from the client without performing any services at\\n\\nall”); In the Matter of Lain, 311 Ga. 427, 437 (857 SE2d 668) (2021);\\n\\nIn the Matter of Majette, 295 Ga. 4, 8 (757 SE2d 114) (2014). The\\n\\nSpecial Master concluded that the approximately $440,000 fee\\n\\nMcDonald claimed in this case was unreasonable because it was\\n\\nexcessively large; not based on any work performed for the third\\n\\nparty, the payor of the fee; and was not immediately returned as\\n\\nunearned after the deal was revealed as fraudulent.\\n\\n     The Special Master rejected McDonald’s defenses—which were\\n\\nthat her retention of the money was reasonable because it was\\n\\nexpressly agreed to by her client, and that the fee she retained was\\n\\nreasonable because it was collected as compensation for services she\\n\\nprovided to her client both in the transaction with the third party\\n\\nand in the months leading up to that transaction—noting again that\\n\\nMcDonald had admitted to knowing that the $4,000,000 still\\n\\nbelonged to the third party, and that the third party had not\\n\\nauthorized disbursement of any of the funds. Further, McDonald did\\n\\n                                 21\\n not specify how the services she actually rendered reasonably\\n\\nequated to the $440,000 of value that she claimed to have provided.\\n\\nThe Special Master concluded that, under those circumstances, it\\n\\nwas not reasonable for McDonald to use the third party’s money,\\n\\nwithout its agreement and while the funds were being held in trust,\\n\\nto pay fees owed by her client before the funds actually belonged to\\n\\nMcDonald or her client. The Special Master also found telling the\\n\\nfact that, although McDonald now admits “in hindsight” that she\\n\\nwas involved in her client’s illegal “scam,” she had taken no steps to\\n\\nfully return the unearned fee to the third party, which would be her\\n\\nresponsibility. Thus, the Special Master determined that McDonald\\n\\nknowingly violated Rule 1.5 (a) by charging, collecting, and\\n\\nretaining the third party’s funds as a fee without its authorization.8\\n\\n            Rule 1.8 (e) – Advancing Money to a Client\\n\\n      In considering the alleged violation of Rule 1.8 (e) (lawyer shall\\n\\nnot provide financial assistance to a client in connection with\\n\\n\\n\\n      8 For reasons noted in our conclusion, we do not rely on this violation for\\n\\npurposes of the discipline imposed.\\n\\n                                       22\\n pending or contemplated litigation with certain exceptions for costs\\n\\nand expenses), the Special Master noted that McDonald admitted\\n\\nshe provided financial assistance to a bankruptcy client when she\\n\\npaid $5,644 to that client’s bankruptcy trustee, and when she lent\\n\\nthat client an additional $3,000. Pointing out that these advances\\n\\ndid not fall within the exceptions set out in Rule 1.8 (e) for advancing\\n\\nor paying court costs and expenses of litigation for certain clients\\n\\nunable to afford those costs, the Special Master concluded that the\\n\\npayments provided financial assistance to her client in connection\\n\\nwith pending litigation, and held that McDonald thus violated Rule\\n\\n1.8 (e) “no matter how benevolent [her] motives” may have been.\\n\\n           Rule 1.15 (I) (a), (c), and (d) - Safekeeping Property\\n           – General\\n\\n     Turning her focus to McDonald’s trust account, the Special\\n\\nMaster first recited that Rule 1.15 (I) (a) requires a lawyer to hold\\n\\nfunds of clients or third persons that are in her possession in\\n\\nconnection with a representation separate from her own funds or\\n\\nother property; appropriately safeguard those funds; and keep\\n\\n\\n                                  23\\n complete records of them. Rule 1.15 (I) (d) provides that, when a\\n\\ndispute arises over various parties’ interests in money or property\\n\\nbeing held by the lawyer, the lawyer shall promptly distribute all\\n\\nundisputed portions of the funds or property and keep separate the\\n\\nportion in dispute until the dispute is resolved, or, if a resolution\\n\\ncannot be reached, to interplead such disputed funds or property.\\n\\n     The Special Master noted that, here, McDonald knew that\\n\\nentitlement to the entire $4,000,000 was being claimed by the third\\n\\nparty, but she did not voluntarily return any of the money until after\\n\\nthe third party filed its grievance and federal lawsuit (and the\\n\\nfederal court ordered her to pay the money into the court’s registry).\\n\\nAnd even then, she only paid into the court a small fraction of the\\n\\namount she had received. The Special Master also noted her\\n\\nadmissions that she was the escrow agent for the deal; that the\\n\\nfunds belonged to the third party, as no Bitcoin was ever transferred\\n\\nto its digital wallet; that the third party had not given her any\\n\\nauthority to disburse any of its money; that she nevertheless\\n\\ndisbursed more than $440,000 of the third party’s money to herself,\\n\\n                                 24\\n her family, and her friends; and that more than a year after the third\\n\\nparty filed its grievance against her she was still claiming more than\\n\\n$200,000 of the third party’s money as lawful fees from her clients.\\n\\n     Given those admissions, the Special Master concluded that,\\n\\nregardless of McDonald’s position that she was acting on behalf of\\n\\nher “clients” with regard to the third party’s money rather than as\\n\\nan “independent escrow agent,” McDonald violated the duties Rule\\n\\n1.15 (I) (a) and (d) impose upon her as a lawyer, because she never\\n\\nheld the third party’s money apart from her own and instead\\n\\ncommingled its money with her own funds when she disbursed it to\\n\\nvarious parties rather than returning it to its rightful owner when\\n\\nthe transaction failed to close. See In the Matter of Doeve, 303 Ga.\\n\\n672 (814 SE2d 330) (2018); In the Matter of Axam, 297 Ga. 786, 786-\\n\\n787 (778 SE2d 222) (2015); In the Matter of Anderson, 286 Ga. 137,\\n\\n140 (685 SE2d 711) (2009) (lawyer who received funds in escrow\\n\\nfrom a depositor for a real estate transaction involving lawyer’s\\n\\nclient and who “paid himself $30,000 from the escrowed funds\\n\\nwithout [depositor’s] knowledge or consent . . . [when he] was not\\n\\n                                 25\\n entitled to any of the escrowed funds as fees and it was his duty to\\n\\nsafeguard those funds for [depositor],” violated Rules 1.15 (I) and\\n\\n1.15 (II)).\\n\\n      In addressing Rule 1.15 (I) (c), the Special Master recited that\\n\\nthe Rule commands that “[u]pon receiving funds or other property\\n\\nin which a . . . third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly\\n\\nnotify the . . . third person” and “shall promptly deliver to the . . .\\n\\nthird person any funds or other property that the . . . third person is\\n\\nentitled to receive and, upon request by the . . . third person, shall\\n\\npromptly render a full accounting regarding such property.” Noting\\n\\nMcDonald’s admissions that she received the third party’s money in\\n\\na fiduciary capacity; that she owed a fiduciary duty to the third party\\n\\nat least with regard to funds on deposit with her; that she knew she\\n\\nreceived the funds to facilitate the Bitcoin transaction, which never\\n\\nclosed; that she knew her client would not be entitled to the money\\n\\nunless it delivered the Bitcoin; that she nevertheless disbursed a\\n\\nlarge portion of the third party’s funds to entities other than the\\n\\nthird party before the deal closed without notifying the third party\\n\\n                                  26\\n or obtaining its consent or authorization; and that she failed to\\n\\naccount for the funds despite the third party’s repeated requests\\n\\nthat she do so (forcing it to file a lawsuit and engage in discovery to\\n\\ndetermine what happened to its money), the Special Master\\n\\nconcluded that McDonald violated Rule 1.15 (I) (c).\\n\\n           Rule 1.15 (II) (a) and (b) – Safekeeping Property -\\n           Trust Accounts\\n\\n     The Special Master first recited that Rule 1.15 (II) (a) requires\\n\\nthat “all funds held by a lawyer in any [] fiduciary capacity shall be\\n\\ndeposited in and administered from a trust account.” Rule 1.15 (II)\\n\\n(b) requires both that records of such accounts be maintained so as\\n\\nto “reflect at all times the exact balance held for each client or third\\n\\nperson” and that “[n]o funds shall be withdrawn from such trust\\n\\naccounts for the personal use of the lawyer maintaining the account\\n\\nexcept earned lawyer’s fees debited against the account of a specific\\n\\nclient and recorded as such.” The Special Master noted that, here,\\n\\nMcDonald was acting in her capacity as a lawyer in connection with\\n\\nthe Bitcoin transaction; that, as a result, the third party deposited\\n\\n\\n                                  27\\n funds into her IOLTA account to be held in escrow; that she received\\n\\nthose funds in a fiduciary capacity; that she improperly disbursed\\n\\nthose funds; and that she did not keep and maintain records of her\\n\\ntrust account. Thus, the Special Master concluded that McDonald\\n\\nviolated Rule 1.15 (II) (a) and (b).\\n\\n           Rule 7.1 and 7.5 (a) and (d)\\n\\n     Pointing to McDonald’s admission that she identified her firm\\n\\nas “McDonald Law Group, LLC” while she was in fact a solo\\n\\npractitioner, see n.2, supra, the Special Master determined that\\n\\nMcDonald had violated Rules 7.1 (lawyer shall not, in relevant part,\\n\\nmake a false or misleading communication about herself or her\\n\\nservices) and 7.5 (a) and (d) (lawyer may not falsely state or imply\\n\\nthrough letterhead, firm or trade name, or other professional\\n\\ndesignation that she practices in a partnership or other\\n\\norganization). The Special Master rejected McDonald’s assertion\\n\\nthat this violation was not “materially misleading,” citing State Bar\\n\\nof Georgia, Formal Advisory Opinion 16-3 (June 14, 2016), which\\n\\nestablished “the principle that any name implying that a firm is\\n\\n                                   28\\n larger than it truly is [including use of the word “Group” in the firm\\n\\nname of a solo practitioner] will be considered false, fraudulent,\\n\\ndeceptive, or misleading and, therefore, a violation of Rules 7.1 and\\n\\n7.5.”\\n\\n        Application of ABA’s Theoretical Framework\\n\\n        The Special Master then recognized that this Court relies on\\n\\nthe ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1992) (“ABA\\n\\nStandards”)     for   guidance   in    determining   punishments     in\\n\\ndisciplinary cases, and that those Standards require consideration\\n\\nof: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer’s mental state; (c) the\\n\\npotential or actual injury caused by the misconduct; and (d) the\\n\\nexistence of aggravating or mitigating factors. See ABA Standards\\n\\n3.0; In the Matter of Morse, 266 Ga. 652, 653 (470 SE2d 232) (1996).\\n\\n             Duties Violated; Mental State; and Injury/Potential\\n             Injury\\n\\n        The Special Master determined, in relevant part, that\\n\\nMcDonald’s Rules violations implicated the duties identified in ABA\\n\\nStandards 4.1 (failure to preserve property of a client or third party),\\n\\n\\n                                  29\\n 4.3 (failure to avoid conflicts of interest), 5.1 (failure to maintain\\n\\npersonal integrity), and 7.0 (violations of other duties as a\\n\\nprofessional). The Special Master found that McDonald did not\\n\\nclaim to suffer from any impairment that would have impacted her\\n\\nability to understand her duties in this matter and concluded that\\n\\nMcDonald’s belief that her client would do the right thing in the end\\n\\ndid not alter the conclusion that her violations, for the most part,\\n\\nwere intentional and knowing.9 Finally, the Special Master noted\\n\\nthe fact that McDonald’s actions resulted in actual and significant\\n\\nfinancial injury to the third party. Thus, the Special Master\\n\\nconcluded that disbarment was the presumptive discipline based on\\n\\nMcDonald’s violations, taken together.\\n\\n           Aggravating and Mitigating Factors\\n\\n     The Special Master found that several factors worked to\\n\\naggravate the degree of discipline that should be imposed on\\n\\n\\n\\n     9  The only exception to that determination was the Special Master’s\\nconclusion that McDonald’s violations of Rules 7.1 and 7.5 (a) and (d) likely\\narose out of her negligent failure to change her firm’s name after the other\\nattorney left the firm. See n.2, supra.\\n\\n                                     30\\n McDonald. As an initial matter, she has a prior disciplinary history,.\\n\\n10   Moreover, she acted with a dishonest and selfish motive, see ABA\\n\\nStandard 9.22 (b); her actions represented the continuation of a\\n\\npattern of misconduct going back to her client’s earlier deals, which\\n\\nwere also never consummated, see ABA Standard 9.22 (c); she was\\n\\nguilty of multiple violations of the Rules, see ABA Standard 9.22 (d);\\n\\nshe was deceptive during the initial phases of the disciplinary\\n\\nprocess when she made materially misleading statements to the\\n\\nBar, see ABA Standard 9.22 (f); although now remorseful, she\\n\\nrepeatedly blamed others for the third party’s injury, refusing to\\n\\nacknowledge that but for her failure to abide by the Bar Rules, no\\n\\ninjury would have come to the third party, see ABA Standard 9.22\\n\\n(g); and she had substantial experience in the practice of law, having\\n\\nbeen admitted in 1985, see ABA Standard 9.22 (i).\\n\\n\\n\\n        10 Specifically, McDonald received an Investigative Panel reprimand on\\n\\nMarch 30, 2012, in a case involving violations of Rules 1.4 (failure to\\ncommunicate), 1.16 (d) (failure to return unearned fee at conclusion of\\nrepresentation), and 8.4 (deception and conversion), which was not dissimilar\\nto the instant case given that, here, she disbursed to herself a fee that she\\neventually admitted she had not earned. See ABA Standard 9.22 (a)\\n\\n                                      31\\n      In addition, the Special Master noted that, although McDonald\\n\\neventually returned half of the funds the third party entrusted to\\n\\nher, she has shown an indifference to making restitution for the\\n\\nremaining damages it suffered, forcing it to sue her to obtain relief,\\n\\nand using the third party’s money to hire counsel to defend herself\\n\\nin that suit, see ABA Standard 9.22 (j). Finally, the Special Master\\n\\nnoted that, even though McDonald has, to date, avoided criminal\\n\\nsanctions, she seems to have participated in an illegal scheme,\\n\\nwhich involved enticing others to wire money into her trust account\\n\\nunder the guise of being a fiduciary, see ABA Standard 9.22 (k).\\n\\n     The Special Master did not cite to any of the mitigating factors\\n\\nspecifically identified in ABA Standard 9.32, but acknowledged that\\n\\nMcDonald had been a longstanding member of the Bar, representing\\n\\nclients in a wide variety of matters with only one prior complaint,\\n\\nwhich did not include a trust account violation.11 The Special Master\\n\\nrejected McDonald’s claim that her discipline should be mitigated by\\n\\n\\n     11 This discussion could arguably implicate the mitigating factor of\\nremoteness of prior offenses, see ABA Standard 9.32 (m), although the Special\\nMaster did not categorize it as such.\\n\\n                                     32\\n evidence of her general character and reputation,12 noting that,\\n\\nalthough she had provided credible and sincere character testimony\\n\\nestablishing that she contributed to her church and her community\\n\\nin meaningful ways to the benefit of society, that testimony provided\\n\\nno mitigating evidence of significant weight as none of those\\n\\nwitnesses had any understanding of the significance of McDonald’s\\n\\nmisconduct and the injury to the public. See In the Matter of\\n\\nNicholson, 299 Ga. 737, 740-741 (791 SE2d 776) (2016) (finding “no\\n\\nmitigating circumstance[s] of significant weight” where character\\n\\nwitnesses only testified to attorney’s reputation as an effective\\n\\nadvocate).\\n\\n     Similarly, the Special Master seemingly rejected McDonald’s\\n\\neffort to rely on remorse13 as a mitigating factor, noting that while\\n\\nshe now appears to be remorseful and able to articulate the\\n\\nsignificance of her misconduct, she was not persuasive in her effort\\n\\nto demonstrate that she understood either her role in this scam or\\n\\n\\n     12 See ABA Standard 9.32 (g).\\n\\n     13 See ABA Standard 9.32 (l).\\n\\n\\n                                     33\\n the fact that she benefitted significantly from it. Finally, the Special\\n\\nMaster rejected McDonald’s effort to establish that she took steps to\\n\\nrectify the consequences of her misconduct,14 noting that, although\\n\\nshe entered into a settlement agreement in the federal lawsuit with\\n\\nthe third party, her capitulation came only after she forced the third\\n\\nparty to sue her to extricate its remaining money from her trust and\\n\\noperating accounts; that she did not voluntarily return the funds\\n\\nremaining in her accounts until forced to do so by the federal court;\\n\\nand that, even after the third party served her with its lawsuit, she\\n\\nused its funds to pay an attorney to represent her in that suit (even\\n\\nthough the attorney later disgorged some of those funds).\\n\\nUltimately, the Special Master determined that McDonald’s conduct\\n\\nin this incident militates against mitigation.\\n\\n      Recommendation for Discipline\\n\\n      The Special Master concluded that McDonald violated Rules\\n\\n1.5 (a); 1.8 (e); 1.15 (I) (a), (c) and (d); 1.15 (II) (a) and (b); 4.1 (a); 7.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      14 See ABA Standard 9.32 (d).\\n\\n\\n                                      34\\n (a); 7.5 (a) and (d); and 8.4 (a) (4) and that the severity of the\\n\\ninfractions and the significance of the injury justified imposition of\\n\\nthe highest level of discipline. Therefore, the Special Master\\n\\nrecommended that McDonald be disbarred.\\n\\n     McDonald’s Exceptions\\n\\n     McDonald sought review from the Review Board, taking\\n\\nexception to the following points: (1) the Special Master’s\\n\\nconclusions that McDonald was knowingly involved in her client’s\\n\\nscam, that she pocketed exorbitant sums from her involvement, and\\n\\nthat she used the third party’s money to pay her defense counsel in\\n\\nthe federal suit; (2) the Special Master’s refusal to give more weight\\n\\nto the testimony of McDonald’s character witnesses and to\\n\\nMcDonald’s own explanation that she acted in good faith based on\\n\\nthe limited knowledge she had of the Bitcoin industry, which was\\n\\nthen a relatively new enterprise; (3) the Special Master’s conclusions\\n\\nas to the applicability of the various factors in aggravation of\\n\\ndiscipline; (4) the Special Master’s decision to use McDonald’s prior\\n\\ndiscipline as an aggravating factor, when it was more than ten years\\n\\n                                 35\\n old and involved dissimilar facts; and (5) the Special Master’s refusal\\n\\nto find that any of the factors in mitigation applied in this case.\\n\\nMcDonald asserted that disbarment was not warranted because the\\n\\nproceedings painted a picture of unconscious bias, and the grievance\\n\\ninvolved a nefarious client under a very specific set of circumstances.\\n\\nShe contended that she should be given some lesser discipline or be\\n\\nallowed to retire from the practice of law.\\n\\n     The Bar’s Response to McDonald’s Exceptions\\n\\n     The Bar responded to each of McDonald’s exceptions, asserting\\n\\ngenerally that the Special Master was in the best position to\\n\\ndetermine the witnesses’ credibility, that the Special Master’s\\n\\nfactual findings were amply supported by the record, and that her\\n\\nconclusions of law were appropriate. The Bar further responded that\\n\\nMcDonald had provided no evidence to support her assertions of\\n\\nunconscious bias and that none existed. The Bar argued that the\\n\\nGRPC exist to protect the public from unethical lawyers, regardless\\n\\nof whether their clients are engaged in shadowy conduct of their\\n\\nown. Finally, the Bar concluded that, because McDonald could have\\n\\n                                  36\\n (and likely would have) gone on to defraud another member of the\\n\\npublic, hoping to get back the funds she needed to re-pay the third\\n\\nparty in this deal, McDonald is exactly the kind of lawyer from\\n\\nwhom the GRPC exist to protect the public.\\n\\n     The Review Board’s Report and Recommendation\\n\\n     The Review Board issued a fairly brief Report and\\n\\nRecommendation, reciting that it had engaged in a “careful review\\n\\nof the record and evidence,” and concluding that the Special Master’s\\n\\nfactual findings were supported by the record and that McDonald\\n\\nhad not shown that those findings were clearly erroneous or\\n\\nmanifestly in error. Similarly, the Review Board considered the\\n\\nSpecial Master’s analysis of the issues presented and concluded that\\n\\nher conclusions of law were correct. Therefore, the Review Board\\n\\nadopted and incorporated the Special Master’s findings of fact and\\n\\nconclusions of law in full.\\n\\n     Further, the Review Board agreed with the Special Master’s\\n\\nanalysis of the duties violated, McDonald’s mental state, the\\n\\npotential or actual injuries caused by McDonald’s misconduct, and\\n\\n                                 37\\n the aggravating and mitigating factors to be applied to this matter.\\n\\nThe Review Board thus recommended that this Court adopt the\\n\\nSpecial Master’s findings related to the appropriate level of\\n\\ndiscipline and disbar McDonald.\\n\\n      McDonald’s Exceptions to the Review Board’s Report15\\n\\n      In her exceptions to the Review Board’s Report and\\n\\nRecommendation, McDonald complains that the Board has not fully\\n\\nindicated the scope of its review, and contends that it should have\\n\\ndone its own analysis to support the Special Master’s conclusion that\\n\\nthe Bar had met its burden of proving by clear and convincing\\n\\nevidence each element of the alleged violations at the time they\\n\\n\\n\\n      15 In addition to filing exceptions to the Review Board’s Report and\\nRecommendation, McDonald also filed directly in this Court a petition—\\nallegedly pursuant to Bar Rule 1-202 (f) (1) and (3)—asking to be transferred\\nto retirement status rather than face disbarment. It is unclear whether\\nMcDonald is seeking review of the Office of the General Counsel’s (“OGC”)\\ndenial of the request that she made there, or whether she intends to petition\\nthis Court for such relief in the first instance, but Bar Rule 1-202 does not\\ncontemplate making a request directly to this Court, and instead clearly directs\\nthat any request to be transferred to retirement status be made to the Bar, and\\nthat a member “with a pending disciplinary matter” may only transfer to\\nretired status if she obtains the consent of the OGC. See Bar Rule 1-202 (f) (1)\\nand (3). In addition, Bar Rule 1-202 includes no provision for appealing the\\nOGC’s denial of such a ruling. Accordingly, her “petition” is dismissed.\\n\\n                                      38\\n purportedly occurred. She contends that a thorough and fair\\n\\nexamination of the record in this case will support her position that\\n\\ndisbarment is not the appropriate discipline.\\n\\n     The Bar’s Response to McDonald’s Exceptions\\n\\n     In response, the Bar notes that the Bar Rules give the Review\\n\\nBoard the power and duty “to review reports of the Special Master”\\n\\nand to recommend discipline to this Court, see Bar Rule 4-215 (a);\\n\\nthe power to “reverse” the Special Master’s findings of fact if the\\n\\nReview Board finds them to be “clearly erroneous or manifestly in\\n\\nerror,” see Bar Rule 4-216 (a); and the power to review de novo the\\n\\nSpecial Master’s “conclusions of law” and “determinations of\\n\\nappropriate sanctions.” Id. The Bar argues that the Review Board’s\\n\\nReport and Recommendation shows that it undertook such a review\\n\\nand concluded that the discipline recommended by the Special\\n\\nMaster was appropriate. The Bar states that the burden is on\\n\\nMcDonald to show specifically where and how the Review Board\\n\\nand/or the Special Master were biased during the proceedings and\\n\\nthat she has not even tried to meet that burden, instead simply\\n\\n                                 39\\n asserting that a new examination of the record by this Court would\\n\\nnot support disbarment. The Bar states that it welcomes such a\\n\\nfresh review, confident that a new examination would support the\\n\\nsame discipline recommended by the Special Master and Review\\n\\nBoard.\\n\\n      Conclusions\\n\\n      Although McDonald filed exceptions to the Report of the\\n\\nReview Board, she does not challenge the Special Master’s\\n\\nconclusions that she violated Rules 1.5 (a);16 1.8 (e); 1.15 (I) (a), (c),\\n\\nand (d); 1.15 (II) (a) and (b); 4.1 (a); 7.1 (a); 7.5 (a) and (d); and 8.4\\n\\n(a) (4) of the GRPC, and, after considering the entire record\\n\\npresented to this Court, we agree with the Special Master’s\\n\\nconclusions     in   that    regard.     Further,     although     McDonald’s\\n\\n\\n\\n      16 As noted above in our discussion of the Special Master’s findings, we\\n\\ndo not rely on the Special Master’s finding that McDonald committed a Rule\\n1.5 (a) violation in determining the discipline in this case. Indeed, we pretermit\\nwhether McDonald committed a Rule 1.5 (a) violation, because determining\\nwhether she did violate Rule 1.5 (a) would require an analysis of whether the\\nfunds that McDonald was found to have converted (i.e., taken without\\nauthorization) could be claimed as a legal fee. Because answering that question\\nis not necessary to the disposition of this case, we do not address the alleged\\nRule 1.5 (a) violation further.\\n\\n                                       40\\n exceptions essentially ask this Court to reconsider the discipline\\n\\nrecommended by the Review Board and the Special Master, she fails\\n\\nto show how the recommended discipline is inappropriate, and our\\n\\nown review indicates that it is not. Indeed, McDonald’s admitted lies\\n\\n(or misrepresentations) to the Bar and to the third party about the\\n\\nstatus of the third party’s funds in her trust account together with\\n\\nher conversion of a large portion of those funds (i.e., the violations of\\n\\nRules 8.4 and 4.1) alone support disbarment. Moreover, when those\\n\\nactions are combined with McDonald’s continuing refusal to see or\\n\\nacknowledge the pivotal role she played in the misdeeds apparently\\n\\nbeing perpetrated by her client and the fact that she has not made\\n\\nthe third party whole, we cannot fathom a punishment less than\\n\\ndisbarment. On top of those violations, McDonald also blatantly\\n\\nviolated Rules 1.15 (I) and (II) in her handling of the money that was\\n\\nentrusted to her and deposited into her IOLTA account. McDonald’s\\n\\ncomplete disregard for her role as a fiduciary in this transaction (and\\n\\napparently other transactions) is staggering and would support\\n\\ndisbarment on its own as well.\\n\\n                                   41\\n      We also agree that the other factors cited by the Special Master\\n\\nin aggravation of punishment apply to this case and that, on the\\n\\nrecord now before us, no factors in mitigation apply. Therefore, we\\n\\nagree that disbarment is the appropriate sanction in this case, and\\n\\nit is hereby ordered that the name of Diana Y. McDonald be removed\\n\\nfrom the rolls of persons authorized to practice law in the State of\\n\\nGeorgia. McDonald is reminded of her duties pursuant to Bar Rule\\n\\n4-219 (b).\\n\\n     Disbarred. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 42\\n '),\n",

TAVAREZ v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n        Edward Tavarez appeals his convictions for malice murder and\\n\\nother offenses arising from the shooting of Travis Ridley during a\\n\\nputative drug deal. 1 Tavarez argues that his trial counsel rendered\\n\\n\\n        1 Ridley was shot on June 1, 2017. On November 27, 2018, a DeKalb\\n\\nCounty grand jury returned an indictment against Tavarez, Abel Asmelash,\\nand Jeanmarie Gonzalez. The indictment charged Tavarez with malice\\nmurder, three counts of felony murder, criminal solicitation, two counts of\\narmed robbery (naming Ridley as the victim in one count and Erica Shavers as\\nthe victim in the other), aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm during\\nthe commission of a felony. It charged Asmelash with those crimes and others,\\nand it charged Gonzalez with making a false statement. Gonzalez’s case was\\nsevered prior to a trial of Asmelash and Tavarez that took place in January\\n2019. Asmelash’s case was severed from Tavarez’s during the January 2019\\ntrial; according to a brief to this Court filed by the State, Asmelash was later\\nconvicted of malice murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of\\nparole. Tavarez was found guilty of all charges against him. On March 5, 2019,\\nthe trial court sentenced Tavarez to life without the possibility of parole for\\nmalice murder, a consecutive three-year sentence for solicitation, two\\nconsecutive life sentences for armed robbery, and a consecutive five-year\\nsentence for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony; the\\naggravated assault count merged with the malice murder count, and the felony\\n ineffective assistance by failing to object to hearsay testimony by a\\n\\ndetective that “bolster[ed]” the account of a key witness. He also\\n\\nargues that the trial court erred by conducting the trial while\\n\\nTavarez’s legs were shackled, forcing him to choose between not\\n\\nparticipating in bench conferences or the jury seeing him in these\\n\\nrestraints. We conclude that Tavarez has not shown that any\\n\\ndeficient performance of counsel in failing to object to the detective’s\\n\\ntestimony prejudiced Tavarez’s defense. Tavarez failed to preserve\\n\\nhis claim about the shackling itself, and he has not shown that he\\n\\nwas excluded from any particular bench conference at which he had\\n\\na right to be present. We therefore affirm.\\n\\n      The evidence admitted at trial showed the following. 2 On June\\n\\n\\nmurder counts were vacated by operation of law. Prior to his sentencing,\\nTavarez filed a premature motion for new trial, which ripened upon entry of\\nthe final disposition order. See Johnson v. State, 316 Ga. 672, 672 n.1 (889\\nSE2d 914) (2023). The motion was amended by appellate counsel on March 15,\\n2023. In an order entered on July 20, 2023, following a hearing, the trial court\\ndenied the motion for new trial. A notice of appeal was filed on August 15,\\n2023. The case was docketed to this Court’s April 2024 term and submitted for\\na decision on the briefs.\\n      2 Because this case involves a question of prejudice under Strickland v.\\n\\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984), we recount the\\ntrial evidence in some detail, weighing the evidence as we would expect\\n\\n                                       2\\n 1, 2017, Ridley was fatally shot in the breezeway of an apartment\\n\\ncomplex. Ridley’s on-and-off-again girlfriend, Erica Shavers, gave\\n\\nthe following account at trial. On the day of the shooting, Ridley\\n\\npicked up Shavers at her home, carrying a bag of $26,000 in cash.\\n\\nBased on what she overheard, Shavers understood that Ridley\\n\\nplanned to purchase some marijuana. Ridley and Shavers drove in\\n\\nhis purple Dodge Challenger to a building in which Ridley was\\n\\nattempting to open some sort of store. Ridley’s friend, known as “Q,”\\n\\nappeared at the store, with a money-counting device. A little later,\\n\\nAbel Asmelash and Rafael Nin-Polanco appeared in a silver\\n\\nMercedes.3 Ridley and Shavers followed the silver Mercedes to a gas\\n\\nstation. While Ridley and Shavers were at the gas station, Q brought\\n\\nRidley a gun at Ridley’s request. Ridley and Shavers then followed\\n\\n\\nreasonable jurors to have done, rather than in the light most favorable to the\\nverdicts. See Harmon v. State, __ Ga. __, __ (1) n.2 (__ SE2d __) (Case No.\\nS24A0158, decided June 11, 2024).\\n       3 Shavers identified Asmelash in court but never identified Nin-Polanco\\n\\nby name, instead referring to him by the hat that he wore. During Shavers’\\ntestimony, the prosecutor began referring to the man who was driving with\\nAsmelash as Nin-Polanco, and Shavers did not correct him. Shavers did make\\nclear in her testimony that Tavarez was not one of the men she saw at the\\nstore. Shavers initially said that the Mercedes looked white to her, but then\\nwent along with the prosecutor’s description of it and referred to it as silver.\\n                                       3\\n the silver Mercedes to the parking deck of a DeKalb County\\n\\napartment complex. While Ridley and Shavers waited in the car,\\n\\nAsmelash left the parking deck via an apartment-complex\\n\\nbreezeway, and Nin-Polanco drove away to let another individual\\n\\ninto the parking deck. After a few minutes, a different Mercedes (a\\n\\nwhite one) driven by Tavarez entered the deck and parked.\\n\\nAsmelash returned from the breezeway, entered the parked, white\\n\\nMercedes, and sat with Tavarez for a moment. Ridley, Shavers,\\n\\nAsmelash, and Tavarez then got out of their cars and all walked into\\n\\nthe breezeway, with Tavarez walking ahead and Shavers carrying\\n\\nthe bag of money. Once in front of a particular apartment that\\n\\nTavarez claimed was his, Tavarez pulled out a gun, stated, “you\\n\\nthink it’s a game,” and demanded that Ridley turn over his phone,\\n\\nwatch, and everything in his pocket. Asmelash took the bag of money\\n\\nout of Shavers’s hand and “vanished.” Ridley threw his watch,\\n\\nphone, and the cigarette pack that had been in his pocket on the\\n\\nground. Tavarez then shot Ridley multiple times, with Ridley\\n\\nreturning fire as he fell to the ground.\\n\\n                                   4\\n      Aspects of Shavers’s testimony were corroborated by video\\n\\nsurveillance recordings from a parking lot outside the store, two gas\\n\\nstations, and the apartment complex, which were played for the\\n\\njury, although none of these recordings showed Ridley’s encounter\\n\\nwith Tavarez. The surveillance video captured Ridley arriving at the\\n\\nstore on the day of the shooting and showed him carrying a small,\\n\\nwhite, drawstring bag and cell phone and wearing a watch, and the\\n\\nvideo showed him still carrying the bag and cell phone and wearing\\n\\na watch after he reemerged from the store.\\n\\n     A tag for the white Mercedes showed that the car was\\n\\nregistered to Jeanmarie Gonzalez, but Tavarez recently had been\\n\\nstopped by police driving that car, and his connection to Gonzalez\\n\\nwas evidenced by social media. According to a detective, Shavers\\n\\nidentified Tavarez in a photo lineup.\\n\\n     A Taurus handgun found underneath Ridley’s body contained\\n\\n14 rounds, out of a maximum capacity of 15. One shell casing and\\n\\none bullet fragment collected at the scene of the shooting were fired\\n\\nfrom that gun. A pack of cigarettes was found at the scene, but\\n\\n                                 5\\n Ridley’s cell phone, watch, and bag of money never were recovered\\n\\nby police.\\n\\n      The medical examiner identified the cause of death as gunshot\\n\\nwounds to the torso and extremities. The evidence showed that one\\n\\nof Ridley’s wounds, a gunshot wound to the foot, was self-inflicted.\\n\\n      Text messages between Tavarez and Gonzalez showed that\\n\\nGonzales texted Tavarez the day before the shooting saying she was\\n\\nconcerned about paying rent, and he texted her hours after the\\n\\nshooting, telling her not to “worry about rent.”\\n\\n      Tavarez did not testify, although he gave a pre-trial statement\\n\\nthat was played for the jury, telling officers that he was supposed to\\n\\nsell marijuana to Ridley on behalf of “Rafael,” so he could make his\\n\\nrent, and that he was not trying to rob Ridley. Tavarez stated that\\n\\nRidley pulled his gun and shot at Tavarez first, and that Tavarez\\n\\nshot Ridley in self-defense.4 His lawyer maintained a justification\\n\\n\\n      4 It is not entirely clear which portions of the statement contained in the\\n\\nappellate record were played for the jury; the trial court had ordered the\\nstatement to be redacted pursuant to Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (88\\nSCt 1620, 20 LE2d 476) (1968), but redaction problems led to Asmelash’s case\\n\\n                                       6\\n defense at trial.\\n\\n      1.    Tavarez argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to\\n\\nobject to testimony by a detective repeating statements by Shavers,\\n\\nthereby “bolstering” her testimony. We disagree.\\n\\n      Detective Corey Van Alen testified at trial about various\\n\\nmatters. Although by that point Shavers already had testified at\\n\\nlength, a significant portion of Detective Van Alen’s testimony\\n\\ninvolved relaying what Shavers told him about events leading up\\n\\nthe shooting, including that when Tavarez stopped in front of a\\n\\nparticular apartment door, he turned around with a gun. Trial\\n\\ncounsel did not object until the detective was asked what Shavers\\n\\nsaid was in the bag that she was carrying as she walked down the\\n\\napartment complex breezeway, and the detective answered that\\n\\nShavers said it contained $26,000 in cash. Tavarez’s counsel\\n\\n\\n\\nbeing severed from Tavarez’s case midtrial. To the extent there is any\\nambiguity in the record about what parts of Tavarez’s statement were played\\nfor the jury, that does not help Tavarez, who bears the burden of establishing\\nthat counsel was constitutionally ineffective. See Payne, 314 Ga. at 328-329\\n(3); see also Rodriguez v. State, 295 Ga. 362, 368 (2) (b) n.11 (761 SE2d 19)\\n(2014) (any ambiguity in the record does not help the appellant, who bears the\\nburden of showing error in the record on appeal).\\n                                      7\\n objected on hearsay grounds, and Asmelash’s counsel interjected\\n\\nthat the testimony amounted to bolstering, an objection with which\\n\\nTavarez’s counsel agreed. The State responded that this was “all\\n\\npart of the course of the investigation which is necessary to complete\\n\\nthe story for the jury.” The trial court stated that it would overrule\\n\\nthe objection “at this time” but instructed the prosecutor to\\n\\n“narrowly focus on what you want him to testify to.” As the\\n\\nprosecutor continued to have the detective narrate what happened\\n\\njust prior to the shooting (albeit without saying explicitly that\\n\\nShavers was the source of his knowledge), Asmelash’s counsel stated\\n\\nthat she had the “same objection,” an unrecorded bench conference\\n\\nwas conducted, and the trial court sustained the objection.\\n\\nAsmelash’s counsel raised a similar objection a few questions later,\\n\\nand the objection again was sustained after an off-the-record bench\\n\\nconference, with Tavarez’s counsel noting on the record that he had\\n\\njoined in the objection. The trial court sustained an objection to\\n\\nsimilar testimony soon after without Asmelash’s counsel even\\n\\nstating the basis for her objection.\\n\\n                                   8\\n        To prove his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Tavarez\\n\\nmust show that counsel’s performance was deficient and that\\n\\ncounsel’s deficient performance prejudiced Tavarez’s defense. See\\n\\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d\\n\\n674) (1984). “If [a defendant] fails to establish one of these two\\n\\nprongs, we need not examine the other.” Payne v. State, 314 Ga. 322,\\n\\n328 (3) (877 SE2d 202) (2022) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n“To show deficient performance, the defendant must demonstrate\\n\\nthat    counsel    performed   counsel’s     duties   in    an     objectively\\n\\nunreasonable way, considering all of the circumstances and in the\\n\\nlight of prevailing professional norms.” Id. at 328-329 (3) (citation\\n\\nomitted). “To establish prejudice, [a defendant] must show that\\n\\nthere    is   a   reasonable   probability    that,   but    for    counsel’s\\n\\nunprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been\\n\\ndifferent.” Id. at 329 (3) (citation and punctuation omitted). “When\\n\\nevaluating whether an appellant has established prejudice under\\n\\nStrickland, we review the record de novo and weigh the evidence as\\n\\nwe would expect reasonable jurors to have done rather than in the\\n\\n                                    9\\n light most favorable to the verdict.” Harmon v. State, __ Ga. __, __\\n\\n(3) (__ SE2d __) (Case No. S24A0158, decided June 11, 2024)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Tavarez argues on appeal that the failure to object sooner to\\n\\nthe detective’s testimony relaying what Shavers told him\\n\\nconstituted ineffective assistance of counsel because the testimony\\n\\nwas hearsay and constituted “improper bolstering” of Shavers’s\\n\\ntestimony. But even assuming that counsel performed deficiently in\\n\\nfailing to object to the detective’s testimony about what Shavers told\\n\\nhim, Tavarez has not shown that he was prejudiced by this failure.\\n\\nEven without the detective’s testimony about what Shavers told\\n\\nhim, the evidence against Tavarez still was very strong. Shavers\\n\\ntestified that Tavarez pulled out a gun once they reached a\\n\\nparticular apartment and demanded Ridley turn over his valuables,\\n\\nwhile an accomplice grabbed the bag of money that Shavers had\\n\\nbeen holding. Shavers testified that Ridley did not shoot at Tavarez\\n\\nfirst, as Tavarez claimed, but rather returned fire after he had fallen\\n\\nto the ground. Shavers’s story was consistent with surveillance video\\n\\n                                  10\\n recordings showing Ridley with a small drawstring bag, cell phone,\\n\\nand watch earlier in the day. Moreover, Tavarez admitted in his\\n\\nstatement played for the jury that he shot Ridley. 5 The evidence that\\n\\nRidley had a cell phone, watch, and bag prior to the shooting that\\n\\ndisappeared before police responded, as well as the evidence of\\n\\nTavarez’s communication to Gonzalez shortly after the shooting\\n\\n(from which the jury could infer that Tavarez had found a solution\\n\\nto her financial concerns), supported Shavers’s story that Tavarez\\n\\nattempted to rob Ridley and undermined Tavarez’s story that he was\\n\\nmerely trying to sell Ridley some marijuana.6\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 Even under Tavarez’s version of events, he could not justify his shooting\\n\\nof Ridley by claiming self-defense, given that the shooting happened while he\\nwas admittedly attempting to sell Ridley marijuana, which is a felony. See\\nOCGA § 16-3-21 (b) (2) (a person is not justified in using force against another\\nin self-defense if the person using force is committing, attempting to commit,\\nor fleeing after the commission of a felony); OCGA § 16-13-30 (j) (selling\\nmarijuana is a felony). But putting aside whether the jury charge on criminal\\nsolicitation alerted the jury that Tavarez’s putative attempt to sell drugs to\\nRidley would amount to a felony, it does not appear that the jury was\\ninstructed that deadly force is not justified when used by someone committing\\nor attempting to commit a felony. Therefore, we do not rely on this rule in\\nconcluding that counsel’s failure to object to the testimony at issue did not\\nprejudice Tavarez’s defense.\\n       6 Indeed, Tavarez acknowledged in his statement to police that Ridley’s\\n\\nbag was taken during the shooting, although he disclaimed responsibility for\\nthe theft.\\n                                       11\\n      Tavarez argues that in evaluating the harmful effect of a trial\\n\\ncourt error in admitting hearsay that is consistent with the\\n\\nspeaker’s trial testimony, but not properly admitted as prior\\n\\nconsistent statements within the meaning of the Evidence Code, we\\n\\n“cannot look to [the witness’s] improperly bolstered testimony to\\n\\nshow that the bolstering error was harmless.” Cowart v. State, 294\\n\\nGa. 333, 341-342 (4) (b) (751 SE2d 399) (2013) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). But as we recently explained, that rule does\\n\\nnot apply where, as here, the claim at issue is one of ineffective\\n\\nassistance of counsel and the applicable standard is whether “the\\n\\ndefendant has established a reasonable probability that the result\\n\\nof the trial would have been different absent counsel’s deficient\\n\\nperformance.” Harmon v. State, __ Ga. at __ (3) n.7 (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). Although the testimony in question by\\n\\nDetective Van Alen may have added some weight to Shavers’s\\n\\ntestimony in suggesting to the jury that Shavers’s testimony was\\n\\nconsistent with her prior statements, he did not bolster her\\n\\ntestimony in the sense that he directly addressed her credibility in\\n\\n                                12\\n violation of OCGA § 24-6-620. See Richardson v. State, __ Ga. __, __\\n\\n(2) (a) (899 SE2d 685) (2024) (“When a witness’s statement does not\\n\\ndirectly address the credibility of another witness . . . , there is no\\n\\nimproper bolstering.” (citation and punctuation omitted)). And even\\n\\nif Tavarez’s counsel had successfully objected to the detective’s\\n\\ntestimony recounting what Shavers had told him, the jury still\\n\\nwould have heard Shavers’s live testimony, as well as Tavarez’s own\\n\\nstatement admitting to the shooting, and the other evidence of\\n\\nTavarez’s guilt. See Harmon, __ Ga. at __ (3) n.7. Given this\\n\\nevidence, Tavarez has not established a reasonable probability of a\\n\\ndifferent   result   absent    trial    counsel’s   assumed   deficient\\n\\nperformance in not objecting to the detective’s testimony about what\\n\\nShavers told police. See id. at __ (3); Henderson v. State, 304 Ga. 733,\\n\\n738 (3) (d) (822 SE2d 228) (2018) (concluding that defendant failed\\n\\nto establish Strickland prejudice from counsel’s failure to object to\\n\\nhearsay based on both strength of evidence of guilt and because\\n\\nhearsay was merely cumulative of trial testimony of declarant).\\n\\n     2.     Tavarez’s only other enumeration of error is that the trial\\n\\n                                   13\\n court erred by conducting the trial while Tavarez’s legs were\\n\\nshackled. We conclude that Tavarez has not shown reversible error\\n\\non this point.\\n\\n     The record shows that Tavarez’s trial was conducted with both\\n\\nTavarez and his co-defendant, Asmelash, in leg restraints. The only\\n\\ndiscussion of this in the trial transcript occurred in the middle of the\\n\\ntrial, with no obvious prompting, when the trial court stated to the\\n\\ntwo defendants outside of the presence of the jury: “[T]he deputy has\\n\\nput leg restraints on you. This is just for safety measures because\\n\\nyou’re going to remain seated the whole time, so you may want to\\n\\nslide closer to the table so that those cannot be seen. This is just for\\n\\n— to accommodate the Court.” At the motion for new trial hearing,\\n\\nTavarez’s appellate counsel raised this issue, and the trial court\\n\\nresponded that the use of leg shackles during the trial of criminal\\n\\ncases was a standard safety protocol in his particular courtroom,\\n\\nnoting the use of table skirts to keep the restraints hidden from\\n\\njurors’ view.\\n\\n     Although his briefing on this enumeration of error is limited,\\n\\n                                  14\\n Tavarez essentially argues that the trial court erred in restraining\\n\\nTavarez’s legs because, although the shackles may have been hidden\\n\\nwhen Tavarez was seated at counsel table, he had to choose between\\n\\nforgoing participation in bench conferences or being seen by the jury\\n\\nin restraints. There is no record of Tavarez having objected to the\\n\\nshackling at trial, which leaves nothing for this Court to review as\\n\\nfar as the shackling itself. See Munn v. State, 313 Ga. 716, 723-724\\n\\n(4) (873 SE2d 166) (2022) (holding that because counsel did not\\n\\nmake a specific objection to shackling of the defendant at trial, “this\\n\\nissue is not preserved for review, and this enumeration of error\\n\\nfails”).7 Tavarez’s argument that the trial court erred by conducting\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 Tavarez’s failure to object means that we do not consider whether the\\n\\nshackling of his legs without any individualized determination as to its\\nnecessity violated any of Tavarez’s constitutional rights. That said, we remind\\ntrial courts that a defendant’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process\\nrights prohibit the use of physical restraints, particularly those visible to the\\njury, absent a trial court determination that they are justified by a state\\ninterest specific to a particular trial. See Deck v. Missouri, 544 U.S. 622, 626-\\n629 (125 SCt 2007, 161 LE2d 953) (2005); see also Hill v. State, 308 Ga. 638,\\n644-648 (2) (842 SE2d 853) (2020) (reversing conviction on ground that trial\\ncourt required defendant to be visibly shackled for the duration of his trial\\nwithout making a record that it considered the impact of visible restraints\\nupon the constitutional rights of criminal defendant, whether those security\\nmeasures were appropriate when that defendant elected to represent himself\\n\\n                                       15\\n bench conferences outside of his presence cannot be disposed of so\\n\\nsimply, however.\\n\\n      Although Tavarez is not clear whether he brings his right-to-\\n\\nbe-present claim under the federal or state constitution, both\\n\\nguarantee criminal defendants the right to be present at certain\\n\\nproceedings against them. See United States v. Gagnon, 470 U.S.\\n\\n522, 526 (105 SCt 1482, 84 LE2d 486) (1985) (“The constitutional\\n\\nright to presence is rooted to a large extent in the Confrontation\\n\\nClause of the Sixth Amendment, but we have recognized that this\\n\\nright is protected by the Due Process Clause in some situations\\n\\nwhere the defendant is not actually confronting witnesses or\\n\\nevidence against him.” (citation omitted)); Pennie v. State, 271 Ga.\\n\\n419, 421 (2) (520 SE2d 448) (1999) (citing Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. I,\\n\\nSec. I, Para. XII for right to be present claim). But this right does\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nat trial, and whether less visible alternatives could achieve the required level\\nof security); compare Potts v. State, 259 Ga. 96, 100 (3) (376 SE2d 851) (1989)\\n(no error in shackling defendant’s legs where considerable record evidence\\nsupported the trial court’s finding that extra security measures with particular\\ndefendant were justified, and steps were taken to shield shackles from view of\\njury).\\n                                      16\\n not encompass all aspects of a criminal trial. The United States\\n\\nSupreme Court has said the federal due process right of presence “is\\n\\nnot guaranteed when presence would be useless, or the benefit but\\n\\na shadow[.]” Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 730, 745 (107 SCt 2658,\\n\\n96 LE2d 631) (1987) (citation and punctuation omitted). Rather,\\n\\nfederal due process “requires that a defendant be allowed to be\\n\\npresent to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted\\n\\nby his absence,” such that “a defendant is guaranteed the right to be\\n\\npresent at any stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its\\n\\noutcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the\\n\\nprocedure.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted). Similarly, the\\n\\nGeorgia constitutional right to be present attaches where “the\\n\\ndefendant’s presence would contribute to the fairness of the\\n\\nprocedure.” Nesby, 310 Ga. at 758 (2) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). In particular, we have said that a defendant’s absence from\\n\\nbench conferences ordinarily does not violate his right to be present\\n\\nunder the Georgia Constitution; “[b]ench conferences pertaining to\\n\\npurely legal issues, such as the admissibility of evidence, ordinarily\\n\\n                                  17\\n do not implicate the right to be present.” Id. at 759 (2) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted); see also United States v. Vasquez, 732 F2d\\n\\n846, 848 (11th Cir. 1984) (“The [federal] right to be present at every\\n\\nstage of trial does not confer upon the defendant the right to be\\n\\npresent at every conference at which a matter pertinent to the case\\n\\nis discussed, or even at every conference with the trial judge at\\n\\nwhich a matter relative to the case is discussed.”); but see Heywood\\n\\nv. State, 292 Ga. 771, 774-775 (3) (743 SE2d 12) (2013) (concluding\\n\\nthat, although defendant was entitled to be present at particular\\n\\nbench conference about whether to replace prospective jurors, he\\n\\nacquiesced in his counsel’s waiver of his right).8\\n\\n\\n\\n      8 In support of his right-to-be-present claim, Tavarez cites only Georgia\\n\\nstate appellate decisions, although at least one of those cases references both\\nfederal and state case law in its analysis of a right-to-be-present claim. We\\nhave said that this Court’s interpretation of the Georgia right to be present\\n“has always been in accord” with the United States Supreme Court’s\\nrecognition of the federal right. Smith v. State, 298 Ga. 406, 409 (2) (782 SE2d\\n269) (2016) (citation and punctuation omitted). “Of course, the United States\\nSupreme Court’s construction of a federal constitutional provision does not\\nbind our construction of a similar Georgia constitutional provision, which must\\nbe construed independently in the light of the Georgia provision’s text, context,\\nand history.” Rockdale County v. U.S. Enterprises, Inc., 312 Ga. 752, 761 (3)\\nn.10 (865 SE2d 135) (2021). Here, the federal and state rights to be present are\\nrooted in wholly different provisions. But Tavarez makes no argument that the\\n\\n                                       18\\n      Here, Tavarez has pointed to no particular bench conference\\n\\nthat he contends he was excluded from in violation of his right to be\\n\\npresent, let alone made a record as to what was discussed at any\\n\\nbench conference conducted in his absence to show that the\\n\\ndiscussion was of the sort that implicated his right to be present.\\n\\nMere speculation about what happened at a bench conference\\n\\ncannot serve as the basis for the grant of a new trial on the ground\\n\\nthat the defendant’s right to be present was violated. See Nesby, 310\\n\\nGa. at 759 (2). And Tavarez does not even attempt to speculate as to\\n\\nwhat occurred at the bench conferences that he now contends he had\\n\\nthe right to attend. Even assuming that shackling amounted to a\\n\\nconstructive exclusion of Tavarez from bench conferences, Tavarez’s\\n\\nfailure to make a showing that any bench conference from which he\\n\\nwas excluded implicated his right to be present precludes success on\\n\\na right-to-be-present claim. See Reed v. State, 314 Ga. 534, 544 (3)\\n\\n(a) (ii), 545 (3) (b) (878 SE2d 217) (2022) (no reversible error based\\n\\n\\nFourteenth Amendment affords him a right to be present that is materially\\nbroader than that afforded him by Article I, Section I, Paragraph XII of the\\nGeorgia Constitution.\\n                                    19\\n on right-to-be-present claim as to certain bench conferences where\\n\\ndefendant made no effort on appeal to address conferences\\n\\nindividually to contest the trial court’s finding that the conferences\\n\\ninvolved legal, procedural, or logistical matters such that they did\\n\\nnot implicate his right to be present); Prickett v. State, 314 Ga. 435,\\n\\n442-443 (2) (877 SE2d 573) (2022) (defendant failed to show his\\n\\nconstitutional right to be present was violated where he made no\\n\\nattempt on appeal to address any particular bench conference at\\n\\nissue or to contest as to any individual conference the trial court’s\\n\\nfindings that that the bench conferences involved legal, procedural,\\n\\nor logistical matters).9\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      9 Because Tavarez has not shown that his right to be present was even\\n\\nimplicated, we need not consider the trial court’s basis for rejecting his claim,\\nthat Tavarez acquiesced in any inability to participate in bench conferences.\\nWe also need not reach Tavarez’s argument on appeal that conducting bench\\nconferences outside his presence is a “structural error” such that he need not\\nshow prejudice in order to obtain reversal of his conviction, an argument that\\npresumes that a violation of the right to be present occurred.\\n                                       20\\n      LAGRUA, Justice, concurring.\\n\\n     I join in full the Majority Opinion but write to caution trial\\n\\ncourts. “It is well established that no person should be tried while\\n\\nshackled except as a last resort[,]” and, should a trial court utilize\\n\\nshackles, the trial court must make “case-specific and individualized\\n\\nfindings to support its initial decision. . . .” Hill v. State, 308 Ga. 638,\\n\\n644-645 (2) (a) (842 SE2d 853) (2020) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). However, if the trial court made such findings here, they\\n\\nare not in the record. And, at the motion for new trial hearing, the\\n\\ntrial court’s explanation for the use of shackles made no reference to\\n\\nthe specific circumstances of Tavarez and Asmelashs’ trial:\\n\\n     And it was the policy of this Court, once the jury has been\\n     selected, to have the individuals have those leg shackles.\\n     And it’s primarily so the Court of Appeals [and] Supreme\\n     Court will know, will make everyone safe. And we’ve had\\n     minimal incidents, at least in my courtroom, whereas\\n     other courtrooms do have other problems, I haven’t had\\n     it. . . . And so it’s for safety, just to make everybody safe. .\\n     . . But I’ll just let the Court of Appeals know it’s really\\n     about safety of the people in the courtroom at that point\\n     in time. And I’m just expressing my opinion. I think it’s\\n     important for me to have people safe when they are doing\\n     their jobs. But everybody[’s] rights will be protected.\\n\\n\\n                                    21\\n Case law makes clear that shackling should not be a general “policy”\\n\\nas described by the trial court here. See Hill, 308 Ga. at 644 (2) (a);\\n\\nsee also Deck v. Missouri, 544 U.S. 622, 626 (II) (125 SCt 2007, 161\\n\\nLE2d 953) (2005) (“The law has long forbidden routine use of visible\\n\\nshackles during the guilt phase; it permits a State to shackle a\\n\\ncriminal defendant only in the presence of a special need.”). The fact\\n\\nthat a defendant, presumed to be innocent, is charged with a violent\\n\\noffense is — in and of itself — insufficient to justify such restraint.\\n\\nAnd if a trial court nonetheless decides to shackle a defendant, “the\\n\\nrecord must provide a basis for [its security] determinations.” Hill,\\n\\n308 Ga. at 644 (2) (a).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  22\\n '),\n",

If, within the\\n      framework of the complaint, evidence may be introduced which will\\n      sustain a grant of the relief sought by the claimant, the complaint is\\n      sufficient and a motion to dismiss should be denied. In deciding a motion\\n      to dismiss, all pleadings are to be construed most favorably to the party\\n      who filed them, and all doubts regarding such pleadings must be resolved\\n      in the filing party’s favor.

Lowe, \\n318 Ga. App. 222\\n, 223 (\\n741 SE2d 155\\n) (2012).\\n\\n      Here, the complaint and the documents attached thereto show that Lexington\\n\\nPark is a residential subdivision in Fulton County. The Lexington Park of Fulton\\n\\nCounty Community Association, Inc. (“the Lexington Park Association” or “the\\n\\nAssociation”), is the incorporated non-profit organization that manages and controls\\n\\nthe subdivision. The subdivision is subject to a declaration of protective covenants,\\n\\nconditions, restrictions, and easements (“the Declaration”), which establishes a\\n                                           2\\n mandatory membership homeowners association, and the affairs of the Association are\\n\\nsubject to a set of bylaws (“the Bylaws”).\\n\\n      In October 2021, five homeowners and members of the Lexington Park\\n\\nAssociation filed the instant lawsuit against the Association.1 The members alleged in\\n\\ntheir complaint that the Association had violated the Declaration and the Bylaws by:\\n\\nimproperly suspending the voting rights of the members; failing to follow proper\\n\\nvoting, election, and meeting procedures; misappropriating funds; failing to follow the\\n\\nproper budgeting process; and improperly amending the Declaration. The members\\n\\nrequested a declaratory judgment that the Association had violated the Declaration\\n\\nand the Bylaws, as well as an order requiring it to comply with the Declaration and the\\n\\nBylaws.\\n\\n      The Lexington Park Association filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for\\n\\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under OCGA § 9-11-12 (b)\\n\\n(6), arguing that because the plaintiffs’ claims involved alleged conduct that did not\\n\\nimpact them uniquely but impacted other members of the Association and the\\n\\n      1\\n        The homeowners and members were Morcia Lewis, Casey Murray, Sherry\\nMoreland, Earl Sullivan, and Yevette Sullivan. Murray and Moreland subsequently\\nfiled an amended complaint alleging additional violations of the Declaration and the\\nBylaws by the Association.\\n                                           3\\n Association as a whole, the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a direct action on their\\n\\nown behalf and were limited to bringing a derivative action on behalf of the\\n\\nAssociation.\\n\\n      Following a hearing,2 the trial court issued an order granting the motion to\\n\\ndismiss. The court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a direct action\\n\\nagainst the Lexington Park Association and were required to bring their claims in a\\n\\nderivative action. The court explained that the injuries set forth in the plaintiffs’\\n\\ncomplaint were not separate and distinct from those suffered by other members of the\\n\\nAssociation, and the plaintiffs did not have a contractual right that existed\\n\\nindependently of any right of members of the Association. Plaintiffs Casey Murray and\\n\\nSherry Moreland then filed the instant appeal.3\\n\\n      1. Murray and Moreland appear to argue that the trial court erred by failing to\\n\\nconsider their response to the motion to dismiss on the basis that it was untimely.4 But\\n\\n\\n\\n      2\\n          There is no transcript of this hearing in the record on appeal.\\n      3\\n         Plaintiffs Morcia Lewis, Earl Sullivan, and Yevette Sullivan have not\\nparticipated in this appeal.\\n      4\\n        We have addressed Murray and Moreland’s arguments in a different order\\nthan they have presented them on appeal.\\n                                            4\\n Murray and Moreland’s argument about the timeliness of their response presents\\n\\nnothing for us to review because it is clear from the court’s order that the court\\n\\nconsidered the response. See Blair v. Bishop, \\n290 Ga. App. 721\\n n.1 (\\n660 SE2d 35\\n)\\n\\n(2008) (“It is well-settled that a person may only challenge a ruling which has\\n\\nadversely affected his or her own rights.”) (citation omitted).\\n\\n      2. Murray and Moreland argue that they have standing to bring a direct action\\n\\nbecause (a) they have separate and distinct injuries from other members of the\\n\\nLexington Park Association and (b) the Declaration gives them the contractual right\\n\\nto sue for violations of the Declaration and the Bylaws. We disagree, but we conclude\\n\\nthat the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ complaint should have been without prejudice.\\n\\n      Claims by members of a corporation against the corporation can be brought in\\n\\neither direct actions or derivative actions.

To have standing to sue\\n      individually, rather than derivatively on behalf of the corporation, the\\n      plaintiff must allege more than an injury resulting from a wrong to the\\n      corporation. To sustain a direct action, the plaintiff must allege an injury\\n      which is separate and distinct from that suffered by other shareholders,\\n      or a wrong involving a contractual right of a shareholder which exists\\n      independently of any right of the corporation. In other words, for a\\n      plaintiff to have standing to bring an individual action, she must be\\n      injured directly or independently of the corporation.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.)

Instead, the plaintiffs have complained about alleged actions\\n\\ntaken by the Association — violations of voting, budgeting, and meeting procedures,\\n\\nmisappropriation of funds, and improper amendment of the Declaration — that affect\\n\\nother members of the Association and the Association as a whole.

The Declaration provides:\\n\\n      Each Owner and occupant shall comply strictly with the Bylaws, rules\\n      and regulations and use restrictions, as amended or modified from time\\n      to time, and with the covenants, conditions, easements and restrictions\\n      set forth in this Declaration. . . . Failure to comply with this Declaration,\\n      the Bylaws or the rules and regulations shall be grounds for an action to\\n      recover sums due for damages or injunctive relief or both, maintainable\\n      by the Association, the Declarant or an aggrieved Owner. . . .\\n\\n\\n      The covenants, conditions, restrictions and easements contained in this\\n      Declaration shall run with and bind the subdivision, and shall inure to the\\n      benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Association, the Declarant and\\n      any Owner, their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors, and\\n      assigns, perpetually to the extent provided by law[.]\\n\\n\\n      Although this enforcement provision appears to create a right for individual\\n\\nmembers of the Association to enforce the Declaration and the Bylaws, the provision\\n\\ndoes not specifically create a right to bring such an enforcement action as a direct\\n\\n\\n                                           9\\n action. Indeed, a derivative action against the Association would constitute a\\n\\nsatisfactory method for the members to enforce the Declaration and the Bylaws.\\n\\n      Murray and Moreland appear to assert that McGee v. Patterson, \\n323 Ga. App.\\n\\n103\\n (\\n746 SE2d 719\\n) (2013), a case which involved a similar enforcement provision in\\n\\nthe covenants of a homeowners association, establishes that the enforcement provision\\n\\nhere allows them to bring a direct action. McGee, however, did not address or discuss\\n\\nthe issue of whether the plaintiffs could bring a direct action. Instead, this Court held\\n\\nthat given the language of the enforcement provision at issue, the trial court erred in\\n\\nruling that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a lawsuit challenging an increased\\n\\nassessment on the basis that they had yet to pay the assessment. \\nId. at 107-108\\n (1). The\\n\\nquestion of standing can arise in multiple contexts, including the issue of whether\\n\\nthere is an actual controversy or whether a plaintiff has suffered a cognizable injury.\\n\\nSee Sons of Confederate Veterans v. Henry County Bd. of Comm., \\n315 Ga. 39\\n, 43-63 (2)\\n\\n(\\n880 SE2d 168\\n) (2022). McGee simply did not address the issue of standing to bring\\n\\na direct or a derivative action and thus does not control the outcome in this case. See\\n\\nCook v. State, \\n313 Ga. 471\\n, 478 (2) (a) (\\n870 SE2d 758\\n) (2022) (“Decisions of . . . the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals do not stand for points that were neither raised by the parties nor\\n\\n\\n                                           10\\n actually decided in the resulting opinion, and questions which merely lurk in the\\n\\nrecord, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be\\n\\nconsidered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.”) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n      (c) Lastly, although the trial court correctly determined that Murray and\\n\\nMoreland could not bring their claims in a direct action, we conclude that the court\\n\\nshould have dismissed the suit without prejudice.\\n\\n      “[A] plaintiff with standing is a prerequisite for the existence of subject matter\\n\\njurisdiction.” (Citation omitted.) Sherman v. Dev. Auth. of Fulton County, \\n324 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 23\\n (\\n749 SE2d 29\\n) (2013). And “the involuntary dismissal of a\\n\\ndeclaratory-judgment action for want of justiciability does not operate as an\\n\\nadjudication on the merits and is instead an issue of subject-matter jurisdiction.\\n\\nAccordingly, dismissal must be without prejudice.” (Citation omitted.)

However, the trial court’s order here does not specify whether the\\n\\ncomplaint was dismissed with or without prejudice, and we presume that actions have\\n\\nbeen dismissed with prejudice when a motion is granted under OCGA § 9-11-12 (b)\\n\\n\\n                                          11\\n (6).

To fall within this general rule, however, the\\napplication must be filed within 30 days of entry of the order or judgment to be\\nappealed. See OCGA § 5-6-35 (d), (j).

SCHMITT v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n        Bryan Keith Schmitt challenges his malice murder conviction\\n\\nfor the death of Hamid Jahangard, who died after being hit by\\n\\nSchmitt’s car. 1 On appeal, Schmitt argues that the trial court\\n\\ncommitted reversible error by denying his request to instruct the\\n\\njury on the defense of accident as to all counts. We conclude that the\\n\\ntrial court erred because at least slight evidence supported that\\n\\n\\n        1 The collision in question occurred on July 30, 2019. A Fulton County\\n\\ngrand jury indicted Schmitt on August 23, 2019, and reindicted him on October\\n8, 2021, charging him with malice murder (Count 1), two counts of felony\\nmurder (Counts 2-3), and two counts of aggravated assault (Counts 4-5). At\\ntrial in September 2022, the jury found Schmitt guilty of all five counts. The\\ntrial court sentenced Schmitt to serve life in prison with the possibility of\\nparole for malice murder and merged the aggravated assault counts with the\\nmalice murder count, and the felony murder counts were vacated by operation\\nof law. Schmitt timely moved for a new trial. On May 16, 2023, the trial court\\nentered an order denying that motion. Schmitt filed a timely notice of appeal,\\nand the case was docketed to the December 2023 term of this Court and orally\\nargued on January 9, 2024.\\n charge. Because the State has not carried its burden to show that it\\n\\nis highly probable that this error did not contribute to the verdict,\\n\\nwe reverse Schmitt’s conviction. And because the trial court also\\n\\nerred in declining the accident instruction as to the related counts\\n\\nof felony murder and aggravated assault, the verdicts on those\\n\\ncounts cannot stand. But the evidence was legally sufficient to\\n\\nsustain Schmitt’s conviction, and so the State may retry him.2\\n\\n      The evidence at trial, including video recordings played for the\\n\\njury, showed the following. 3 On July 30, 2019, Schmitt was driving\\n\\nhis regular commute home from work through a residential area\\n\\nwhen he saw Jahangard standing by the road. Jahangard made a\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Schmitt also asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by\\ndenying his motion to exclude State expert testimony that the evidence was\\ninconsistent with an accidental motor vehicle collision, erred by denying his\\nrequest to charge either of the lesser offenses of “unlawful act” and “unlawful\\nmanner” involuntary manslaughter, and erred by overruling his motion under\\nNapue v. Illinois, \\n360 U.S. 264\\n (79 SCt 1173) (1959). Because we reverse and\\nthese alleged errors are unlikely to occur again if the State retries him, we do\\nnot address them. See Heard v. State, \\n309 Ga. 76\\n, 83 (2) n.10 (\\n884 SE2d 791\\n)\\n(2020).\\n      3 Because this case calls us to consider whether the trial court’s error was\\n\\nharmless, we recount the evidence reasonably and in detail and weigh the\\nevidence as we would expect reasonable jurors to have done, as opposed to\\nviewing it solely in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdicts. See Moore v.\\nState, \\n315 Ga. 263\\n, 264 n.2 (1) (\\n882 SE2d 227\\n) (2022).\\n                                        2\\n bouncing or throwing motion with his arm. Schmitt heard a “very\\n\\nloud noise” and felt something slam into the front of his car, “hit [his]\\n\\nbrakes,” continued driving, turned around, and returned to where\\n\\nhe saw Jahangard standing near trashcans in a driveway. Schmitt\\n\\nstopped his car in the right lane, with a lane separating him from\\n\\nJahangard on the left, and rolled his window down. They argued\\n\\nacross traffic as cars passed Schmitt’s stopped car.\\n\\n      The nature of the argument is unclear. At trial, Schmitt\\n\\ntestified that he was leery about pulling into the driveway\\n\\nimmediately, as he “didn’t know who this was or what the situation\\n\\nmight have been.” He testified that he asked whether Jahangard\\n\\n“thr[e]w a golf ball or what happened[,]” and Jahangard yelled in\\n\\nresponse — in a dismissive and loud voice — for him to “get the f**k\\n\\nout of here.” In contrast, Jahangard’s brother, Manoucher\\n\\nJahangard, testified that he and Jahangard were talking on the\\n\\nphone 4 when someone talking in a “very loud and fast and angry”\\n\\n\\n      4  Manoucher testified that his phone showed that he or Jahangard\\ninitiated the call at 5:37 p.m. The State played for the jury a time-stamped\\nvideo of the collision that appears to show Jahangard on the phone at this time.\\n                                       3\\n manner 5    interrupted      their   conversation.      Manoucher       heard\\n\\nJahangard sound “very surprised” and repeat three times, “I didn’t\\n\\nthrow anything to you, sir[,]” but the yelling continued. After\\n\\nJahangard repeated for the third time, “I didn’t throw anything to\\n\\nyou, sir[,]” Manoucher heard “a bunch of noise” and Jahangard say\\n\\n“[g]et away from my face,” but then the phone disconnected. 6\\n\\n      During this argument, Schmitt decided to turn left into the\\n\\ndriveway and accelerated his car to between fifteen and sixteen\\n\\nmiles per hour. During that turn, Schmitt’s brake light came on at\\n\\nleast once, 7 and he began to veer his car away from Jahangard to the\\n\\nright. Schmitt’s car struck Jahangard.8\\n\\n\\n\\n      5   On cross-examination, Schmitt’s counsel attempted to elicit\\nManoucher’s agreement that the words “angry” and “aggressive” did not\\nappear in the transcript of his initial interview, and he ultimately responded,\\n“[m]aybe not.”\\n       6 Manoucher testified that, at the time, Jahangard was waiting in the\\n\\ndriveway to direct painters to his rental property. Manoucher was “very\\nworried because of the conversation,” so he left immediately to check on\\nJahangard.\\n       7 Despite using the same video surveillance footage, the State’s expert\\n\\nand Schmitt’s expert disputed the exact moment that Schmitt hit his brakes.\\nThis video surveillance footage was played several times for the jury. Schmitt\\nalso testified that he hit the brakes before colliding with Jahangard.\\n       8 Hours later, after Jahangard’s family realized that Jahangard’s cell\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      4\\n      Jahangard immediately fell to the driveway, hit his head, and\\n\\nbegan bleeding. Schmitt put his car in park and, without turning it\\n\\noff, exited to render aid. Schmitt kneeled next to Jahangard and\\n\\nstabilized his head while awaiting paramedics. Jahangard died days\\n\\nlater, and the autopsy revealed the cause of death as “blunt force\\n\\ninjuries of the head due to a motor vehicle collision, car versus\\n\\npedestrian.”\\n\\n     At trial, Schmitt testified in his own defense, denied using the\\n\\ncar as a weapon, and denied intentionally striking Jahangard.\\n\\nSchmitt testified that he turned into the driveway “to try to sort out\\n\\nwhat happened and to see if there was any damage to [his] car.” He\\n\\nknew that he was too far up the road to turn left, and he thought he\\n\\ncould make a U-turn to turn right into the driveway without\\n\\nimpacting Jahangard, but he misjudged the turning radius of his\\n\\ncar.9 As he turned, Schmitt checked oncoming traffic, his rearview\\n\\n\\n\\nphone was missing, Jahangard’s phone was tracked to Schmitt’s home address.\\nAn officer found the phone, after having someone call it, stuck under the\\nwindshield wiper of Schmitt’s car with a “completely shattered” front screen.\\n     9 During cross-examination, the State elicited that at the time of the\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     5\\n mirror, and his side mirror, losing his focus on Jahangard. When he\\n\\nrealized the trashcans were directly in front of him, he instinctively\\n\\ncut his wheel to the right and hit the brakes to miss them. Schmitt\\n\\ntestified that, upon hitting Jahangard, his military medical training\\n\\ntook over and he immediately began to render aid.10 Throughout his\\n\\ntestimony, he referred to the collision as an accident, and he insisted\\n\\nthat he did not intend to harm, hurt, scare, intimidate, or kill\\n\\nJahangard. He testified that he “was trying to avoid an accident”\\n\\nand “was trying to de-escalate the situation.”\\n\\n      Both parties’ experts acknowledged that the steering wheel\\n\\nwas turned to the right before the collision, which kept the center of\\n\\nthe car from striking Jahangard, 11 Schmitt’s expert specifically\\n\\ntestified that the front left corner of Schmitt’s car struck Jahangard,\\n\\nand the State’s expert conceded that only a few inches — “the very\\n\\n\\n\\ncollision Schmitt had been driving for about thirty years and had driven the\\ncar that hit Jahangard for six years.\\n       10 Schmitt testified that medical training was a “critical part of military\\n\\ntraining” and was included as “part of the regular training” that he received\\nduring his years serving in the military.\\n       11 The State’s expert also testified that if the wheel had been turned more\\n\\nto the right, Schmitt may have altogether avoided contact with Jahangard.\\n                                        6\\n left edge” — of the car struck Jahangard. The experts also opined\\n\\nthat once Schmitt began his turn, a collision was inevitable. The\\n\\nState’s expert opined that a black stain on Jahangard’s pants, which\\n\\nwere in evidence, was caused by a tire transfer, meaning that the\\n\\ncar’s front tire rolled over Jahangard’s left foot and ankle, and that\\n\\nthe car’s rear tire rolled over his knee. Schmitt’s expert opined that\\n\\nthe car did not run over Jahangard’s leg, as the GBI investigative\\n\\nreport did not reveal automotive paint, plastic, or grease on\\n\\nJahangard’s clothes and based on the expert’s review of a video of\\n\\nthe collision.\\n\\n     Several witnesses also testified at trial. Donald Utroska, Jr.,\\n\\ntestified that he was driving when “all of a sudden” he saw “garbage\\n\\ncans and a car” move “swiftly” into the driveway. The car moved into\\n\\nthe driveway “awfully fast” and sent “very tall garbage cans in the\\n\\nair a good three to four feet.” Utroska pulled over when he saw\\n\\nJahangard on the driveway with pooling blood, and Schmitt asked\\n\\nhim to call 911. He also testified that Schmitt explained that\\n\\nJahangard threw a golf ball at his car, Schmitt and Jahangard\\n\\n                                  7\\n argued, and when Schmitt pulled over to discuss it, Jahangard\\n\\njumped in front of his car. After paramedics arrived, Utroska offered\\n\\nhis contact information to Schmitt and found it “a little strange” that\\n\\nSchmitt declined. Utroska described Schmitt’s demeanor as “very\\n\\nemotionless, very plain[,]” and “nonchalant.”\\n\\n     Jessica Woodsen testified that she lived across the street from\\n\\nwhere the collision occurred and her security camera recorded the\\n\\ncollision. Though she did not see the collision, she saw out of her\\n\\nwindow two men standing and one man lying on the driveway across\\n\\nthe street. She described the man in the driveway as “laid out,”\\n\\nunmoving, with his eyes open, with blood coming from his head, and\\n\\nwith his left leg hyperextended at the knee. When she arrived, the\\n\\ncar was still running and Schmitt was attempting to render aid to\\n\\nJahangard. She reprimanded Schmitt for attempting to move\\n\\nJahangard’s leg, which was under the back bumper and behind the\\n\\ndriver’s side back wheel. Woodsen testified that, when asked what\\n\\nhappened, Schmitt told her that Jahangard was walking, yelled\\n\\nsomething, and threw something at his car. When Schmitt turned in\\n\\n                                  8\\n the driveway to see what happened, Jahangard pushed a trashcan\\n\\nonto his car, and the trashcan bounced off of Schmitt’s car and\\n\\nknocked Jahangard over. Woodsen described Schmitt’s demeanor as\\n\\n“a little defensive” and as not giving the impression that he was\\n\\nconcerned about Jahangard.\\n\\n     Mokraine Lhocine testified that he was driving a company van\\n\\nthat contained a dashcam that recorded the collision. Lhocine saw a\\n\\nstopped car in the middle of the road with cars passing it, then the\\n\\ncar made a “quick” turn and hit trashcans. As Lhocine continued\\n\\ndown the road, he saw that the door of the car was open, the driver\\n\\nwas holding somebody on the ground, and “there was a lot of blood\\n\\naround him.”\\n\\n     Captain   Jeremiah    Green     of   the   Sandy   Springs   Fire\\n\\nDepartment testified that, when he arrived, Schmitt was kneeling\\n\\nbeside Jahangard and focused on holding Jahangard’s neck in a way\\n\\nthat protected the spine from further injury. Schmitt told Captain\\n\\nGreen that he did not know what happened or remember if\\n\\nJahangard was hit. Schmitt “mentioned something about a golf ball,\\n\\n                                 9\\n and he mentioned that the patient was yelling at him.”\\n\\n      James Durden, a paramedic, testified that when he arrived\\n\\nJahangard was unconscious but breathing spontaneously, lying on\\n\\nhis back with a significant amount of blood coming from the back of\\n\\nhis head and ears, with possible hyperextension to his left leg.\\n\\nSchmitt did not remember whether Jahangard “went up and over or\\n\\nunderneath” the car, and Durden was “a little struck that there\\n\\nwasn’t more emotion or concern[.]”\\n\\n      Police arrived around 40 minutes after the collision, and it had\\n\\nstarted raining. 12 By that point, firefighters had moved the trash\\n\\ncans, Schmitt had been permitted to move his vehicle, the rain\\n\\nwashed “[n]inety-nine percent of the blood away[,]” and a moving\\n\\nvan had driven through the driveway. Police officers nevertheless\\n\\nphotographed the scene, a golf ball found in a neighbor’s yard, and\\n\\nSchmitt’s car. Police permitted Schmitt to drive the car home. The\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      12 Schmitt’s counsel elicited law enforcement testimony that, despite this\\n\\ndelay, Schmitt remained voluntarily on the scene for an additional 30 to 40\\nminutes after police arrived while he was interviewed by police twice and wrote\\na statement, before being dismissed by police.\\n                                      10\\n lead detective testified that when police ultimately seized Schmitt’s\\n\\nvehicle pursuant to a warrant several days later, there was no fiber,\\n\\nhair, clothes, or anything of evidentiary value found.\\n\\n     Two video recordings of the collision were played for the jury:\\n\\nWoodsen’s security video and the company van’s dashcam video.\\n\\nThe State also played body camera footage from the police officer\\n\\nwho responded to the scene. As captured in that recording, Schmitt\\n\\ndescribed that Jahangard pushed a trash can in front of his car as\\n\\nhe began to make a U-turn, Schmitt swerved to miss it, and the\\n\\ntrash can hit the corner of his car and bumped Jahangard, who lost\\n\\nhis footing and fell. The State also presented Schmitt’s written\\n\\nstatement, which consisted of a similar narrative.\\n\\n     1. Schmitt argues that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\nrequest to instruct the jury on accident as a defense to malice\\n\\nmurder and that this error was not harmless. We agree.\\n\\n     Schmitt timely requested a jury instruction on the defense of\\n\\naccident and contended that the evidence supported that charge.\\n\\nAlthough the trial court indicated initially that it was proper to\\n\\n                                 11\\n instruct the jury on the defense of accident, it changed its position\\n\\nseveral times and ultimately rejected this instruction as to all\\n\\ncounts.13\\n\\n      Hours after the charge conference, in his closing argument,\\n\\nSchmitt presented a slide labeled “KEY LEGAL PRINCIPLES” that\\n\\nstated, “ACCIDENT: IF THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT, AND THERE\\n\\nWAS NO CRIMINAL INTENT, THIS WAS NOT A CRIME.” The\\n\\nState objected “based on the slide and that this is a legal principle.”\\n\\nThe State continued, “This is not a principle applicable to this case\\n\\nand not a charge of the Court.” The court sent the jury out to discuss\\n\\nwith the parties. The trial court directed Schmitt that, although the\\n\\ncourt rejected the accident charge, Schmitt could “argue that it was\\n\\nunintentional” — in other words, Schmitt could argue that he lacked\\n\\nthe necessary intent. The trial court eventually brought back the\\n\\n\\n\\n      13 The trial court opined, “[t]his is all going to turn on whether or not\\n\\naccident refers to . . . whether or not the movement of the car is intentional or\\nnot, notwithstanding the result of what happened and a suggestion that the\\nevidence — some parts of the evidence are that the result was unintended, but\\nthe turn and the movement of the vehicle clearly was intended, and so I think\\nit comes down to that.” The trial court distinguished between the “use of\\naccident as we use it as human beings” and the legal definition of accident.\\n                                       12\\n jury, sustained the State’s objection, and instructed the jury:\\n\\n     to disregard the statement offered by the defense counsel;\\n     in particular, that “accident” is a key legal principle that\\n     is a part of this case because it is not. It was therefore\\n     improper for defense counsel to display a slide designated\\n     Key Legal Principles with the word “accident” below it.\\n\\n     Schmitt continued his closing argument and insisted that\\n\\n“[t]his was an accident” and that, “[i]f this was an accident, if there\\n\\nwas no criminal intent, then it’s not a crime.” The trial court\\n\\ninstructed the jury on the presumption of innocence, the burden of\\n\\nproof, the definition of intent, the definition of malice, and that\\n\\nmalice could be express, implied, or both. During deliberations, the\\n\\njury requested a copy of Black’s Law Dictionary “for [a] definition of\\n\\nabandoned and malignant heart[,]” to view the PowerPoint\\n\\npresentations used by the parties in closing argument, and a\\n\\ntranscript of closing arguments. The trial court denied each of these\\n\\nrequests and instructed the jury to rely on the law as charged.\\n\\n     (a)   The trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on\\n           accident as a defense to malice murder.\\n\\n     “[The] accident defense applies where the evidence negates the\\n\\n\\n                                  13\\n defendant’s criminal intent, whatever that intent element is for the\\n\\ncrime at issue.” State v. Ogilvie, \\n292 Ga. 6\\n, 9 (2) (b) (\\n734 SE2d 50\\n)\\n\\n(2012). In the context of malice murder, that means that an accident\\n\\ndefense is available when there is evidence that the defendant\\n\\ncaused another’s death but acted without an express or implied\\n\\nintent to commit an unlawful homicide. See \\nid. at 10\\n (2) (c); OCGA §\\n\\n16-5-1; Taylor v. State, \\n303 Ga. 624\\n, 626 (1) (\\n814 SE2d 353\\n) (2018)\\n\\n(defining intent requirement for malice murder).\\n\\n     “[T]o authorize a requested jury instruction, there need only be\\n\\nslight evidence supporting the theory of the charge[.]” Wainwright\\n\\nv. State, \\n305 Ga. 63\\n, 70 (5) (a) (\\n823 SE2d 749\\n) (2019) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). The State contends that slight evidence did\\n\\nnot support the accident instruction because, in the context of the\\n\\naffirmative defense of accident, this Court has held that a\\n\\ndefendant’s conclusory claims that the defendant “didn’t mean to do\\n\\nit” or that a particular act “was an accident” “are insufficient without\\n\\nmore to authorize a charge on accident.” Mann v. State, \\n307 Ga. 696\\n,\\n\\n699 (2) (a) (\\n838 SE2d 305\\n) (2020) (citation and punctuation omitted)\\n\\n                                  14\\n (holding that any error in failing to give requested accident\\n\\ninstruction was harmless, although defendant indicated he intended\\n\\nto throw the seven-year old victim on a bed rather than on the\\n\\nground, because evidence — including that the victim’s “devastating\\n\\ninjuries, including bruising to his genitals, bruising to his body,\\n\\nretinal hemorrhaging in both eyes, bleeding and swelling in the\\n\\nbrain, and ultimately brain death” resulted from the defendant’s\\n\\n“intentional acts of beating, squeezing, and throwing” the victim —\\n\\noverwhelmingly supported the jury’s finding that the defendant\\n\\nacted with malice)); see also Mills v. State, \\n287 Ga. 828\\n, 832 (4) (\\n700\\n\\nSE2d 544\\n) (2010) (holding the misuse of a firearm described by the\\n\\ndefendant showed a degree of culpability which constituted criminal\\n\\nnegligence such that the trial court did not err in refusing the\\n\\naccident instruction); McDade v. State, \\n270 Ga. 654\\n, 657 (5) (\\n513\\n\\nSE2d 733\\n) (1999) (holding that the trial court properly rejected\\n\\nrequest for accident instruction when defendant’s statements and\\n\\nversions of events either could not have resulted in victim’s fatal\\n\\ngunshot wound or did not show the absence of a criminal scheme,\\n\\n                                  15\\n undertaking, intention, or criminal negligence), disapproved of on\\n\\nother grounds by Clark v. State, \\n315 Ga. 423\\n, 435 (3) (b) n.16 (\\n883\\n\\nSE2d 317\\n) (2023).\\n\\n     But those decisions do not apply here. In each of those cases,\\n\\nevidence of intentionality was strong and there was no theory of\\n\\naccident that would not have necessarily constituted criminal\\n\\nnegligence. See Browner v. State, \\n296 Ga. 138\\n, 144 (4) (\\n765 SE2d\\n\\n348\\n) (2014) (defining criminal negligence as a “reckless and wanton\\n\\nnegligence of such a character as to show an utter disregard for the\\n\\nsafety of others who might reasonably be expected to be injured\\n\\nthereby”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     In comparison, the evidence supporting Schmitt’s theory of\\n\\naccident did not require a finding of criminal negligence. Instead,\\n\\nthe undisputed evidence showed that Schmitt turned his car left,\\n\\naccelerated his car to between 15 and 16 miles per hour, veered his\\n\\ncar to the right and away from Jahangard, at some point tapped his\\n\\nbrakes, and that the left edge of Schmitt’s car struck Jahangard.\\n\\nNothing about this necessarily shows any criminal negligence\\n\\n                                16\\n because Schmitt’s theory of accident does not rest on conduct which\\n\\nis itself a criminal act and because a rational juror could find from\\n\\nthe evidence that this was an accident. And so in this context,\\n\\nSchmitt’s testimony that the collision was an accident presented at\\n\\nleast slight evidence necessary to warrant an instruction on the\\n\\ndefense of accident.\\n\\n     The State argues that Schmitt acted with an utter disregard\\n\\nfor Jahangard’s safety (and thus criminal negligence) when he\\n\\naccelerated into the driveway with knowledge of Jahangard’s\\n\\nlocation. But this is a disputed issue, and there was other evidence\\n\\nthat a juror could find showed a lack of such criminal negligence.\\n\\nSchmitt testified that he turned into the driveway “to try to sort out\\n\\nwhat happened and to see if there was any damage to [his] car.”\\n\\nSchmitt denied using the car as a weapon, denied intending to\\n\\nintimidate Jahangard, and denied intentionally striking Jahangard.\\n\\nRather, Schmitt testified that he misjudged the turning radius of his\\n\\ncar, he lost his focus on Jahangard as he checked for traffic as he\\n\\nturned, he turned his car to the right — away from Jahangard —\\n\\n                                 17\\n before the collision, and he slammed on brakes. Moreover, Schmitt\\n\\nand his expert testified that his brake lights came on, went off, and\\n\\ncame back on before the collision; witnesses testified that Schmitt\\n\\nrendered immediate aid; video footage corroborated that he\\n\\nrendered immediate aid; both experts testified that Schmitt turned\\n\\nhis car to the right, away from Jahangard, before the collision; both\\n\\nexperts described that the front left corner of Schmitt’s car (rather\\n\\nthan the center of the car) hit Jahangard; and Schmitt’s expert\\n\\ntestified that a GBI investigative report revealed that there was no\\n\\nautomotive paint, plastic, or grease on Jahangard’s clothes.\\n\\n     Therefore, at least slight evidence supported that “there was\\n\\nno criminal scheme or undertaking, intention, or criminal\\n\\nnegligence,” and the trial court erred in declining the accident\\n\\ninstruction. OCGA § 16-2-2.\\n\\n     (b)   The trial court’s error was not harmless.\\n\\n     The State has failed to carry its burden to show that this error\\n\\nwas harmless. Evidence of Schmitt’s criminal intent was conflicting\\n\\nand far from overwhelming, and the harm from the trial court’s\\n\\n                                 18\\n failure to instruct the jury on the defense of accident was\\n\\ncompounded by the trial court’s express instruction that the jury\\n\\nmust “disregard” that accident was a key legal principle.\\n\\n     As an initial matter, it is well settled that “[t]he test for\\n\\ndetermining nonconstitutional harmless error is whether it is highly\\n\\nprobable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.” Jivens v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 859\\n, 863 (2) (\\n896 SE2d 516\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). For this analysis, “we review the record de\\n\\nnovo and weigh the evidence as we would expect reasonable jurors\\n\\nwould have done instead of viewing it in the light most favorable to\\n\\nthe jury’s verdict.” \\nId.\\n\\n\\n     The parties do not dispute that Schmitt caused Jahangard’s\\n\\ndeath when he turned his car into the driveway and his car collided\\n\\nwith Jahangard. Rather, the central question presented to the jury\\n\\nwas whether Schmitt acted with criminal intent. 14 And evidence as\\n\\n\\n     14 In his opening statement, Schmitt condensed the crux of his argument:\\n\\n     The one real dispute in this case, the one question that really\\n     matters, the key question that you, the jury, will have to answer\\n     when deciding the fate of Mr. Schmitt is this. What was Mr.\\n\\n                                    19\\n to this point was far from overwhelming.\\n\\n      The State contends that evidence of Schmitt’s conduct and\\n\\ndemeanor before, during, and after the collision presented evidence\\n\\nof his criminal intent — that he intended to kill Jahangard. See\\n\\nGuzman-Perez v. State, \\n310 Ga. 573\\n, 576-577 (1) (\\n853 SE2d 76\\n)\\n\\n(2020) (“[C]riminal intent is a question for the factfinder, and can be\\n\\ninferred from the defendant’s conduct before, during, and after the\\n\\ncommission of the crimes[.]”). Among other things, the State points\\n\\nto the argument before the collision, which was corroborated with\\n\\ntime-stamped video footage showing Jahangard on the phone at this\\n\\ntime and the fact that Jahangard’s phone was found hours later,\\n\\n“completely shattered,” under the car’s windshield wiper. The State\\n\\nelicited that Schmitt intended to return to where he saw Jahangard\\n\\nstanding, to turn left despite knowing Jahangard’s proximity to his\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Schmitt intending to do when he pulled in that driveway and made\\n      that turn?\\nSimilarly, in closing argument, the State explained to the jury that “[t]he\\nquestion is whether or not the defendant’s intentional actions, as demonstrated\\nby the evidence that’s been introduced here and by his own admissions, were\\ncriminal. Were they criminal? That is the dispute at issue. That’s it.”\\n                                      20\\n car, and to accelerate his car. The State pointed to expert testimony\\n\\nthat, once the turn began, the collision was inevitable. The State’s\\n\\nexpert further opined that the stain on Jahangard’s pants must have\\n\\ncome from tire transfer, the car’s front tire rolled over his knee and\\n\\nankle, the car’s rear tire rolled over his knee, and that evidence of\\n\\nthe injuries was inconsistent with an accidental collision. Witnesses\\n\\ndescribed how “awfully fast,” “all of a sudden,” and “quick” the car\\n\\nturned and sent “very tall garbage cans in the air a good three to\\n\\nfour feet.” These witnesses were “a little struck that there wasn’t\\n\\nmore emotion or concern” and described Schmitt’s demeanor as\\n\\n“very emotionless, very plain[,]” and “nonchalant[,]” “a little\\n\\ndefensive[,]” and seemingly not concerned about Jahangard. These\\n\\nwitnesses also testified as to differing accounts Schmitt provided\\n\\nabout what happened: (1) Jahangard pushed a trashcan on\\n\\nSchmitt’s car, which bounced off and knocked Jahangard over; (2)\\n\\nSchmitt could not remember what happened, or (3) Jahangard\\n\\njumped in front of his car. The State contended the fact that in each\\n\\naccount Schmitt mentioned the argument, mentioned the golf ball,\\n\\n                                 21\\n and downplayed Jahangard’s injuries further evidenced Schmitt’s\\n\\ncriminal intent.\\n\\n     On the other hand, Schmitt asserts that evidence from before,\\n\\nduring, and after the collision shows an absence of criminal intent.\\n\\nAmong other things, Schmitt points to his testimony that he\\n\\nintended to de-escalate the situation and talk it over, he misjudged\\n\\nthe turning radius of his car, he lost his focus on Jahangard while\\n\\nmaking the turn, he instinctively cut his wheel to the right and hit\\n\\nthe brakes, and he exited the car and, without turning it off,\\n\\nrendered immediate aid. Schmitt corroborated his testimony about\\n\\nrendering aid with witness testimony and video footage. Schmitt\\n\\nalso denied using the car as a weapon or to strike Jahangard.\\n\\nMoreover, Schmitt presented expert testimony opining that\\n\\nSchmitt’s brake lights came on twice and that Schmitt veered away\\n\\nfrom Jahangard, thus indicating his efforts to slow down and avoid\\n\\nhitting Jahangard, Schmitt moved between fifteen and sixteen miles\\n\\nper hour during the turn, and that the car did not run over\\n\\nJahangard’s leg. Further, expert testimony highlighted that the\\n\\n                                22\\n GBI’s investigative report did not reveal the presence of automotive\\n\\npaint, plastic, or grease on Jahangard’s clothes.\\n\\n     Although there was certainly evidence supporting the State’s\\n\\ntheory that Schmitt acted with malice, that evidence was disputed\\n\\nand not overwhelming. This is especially so when undisputed\\n\\nevidence showed that Schmitt turned his car away from Jahangard\\n\\nsuch that only the edge of his car struck Jahangard, Schmitt\\n\\nimmediately rendered aid, and Schmitt did not leave or try to leave\\n\\nuntil police officers dismissed him. See Rush v. State, \\n294 Ga. 388\\n,\\n\\n390 (2) (a) (\\n754 SE2d 63\\n) (2014) (evidence of a defendant’s attempt\\n\\nto flee or evade arrest can be circumstantial evidence of guilt).\\n\\n     The State contends that any error was harmless because the\\n\\ntrial court did not foreclose Schmitt’s accident defense and because,\\n\\nin finding Schmitt guilty of malice murder, the jury necessarily\\n\\nrejected this defense. We disagree.\\n\\n     One way that the failure to give an accident instruction can be\\n\\nharmless is if the jury finds the defendant guilty of malice murder\\n\\nafter “the trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements of\\n\\n                                  23\\n murder and the requisite malicious intent[,]” because the jury’s\\n\\nconclusion that the defendant acted with malice necessarily means\\n\\nthat the jury would have discredited the accident defense. McClain\\n\\nv. State, \\n303 Ga. 6\\n, 9-10 (2) (\\n810 SE2d 77\\n) (2018); see also Sears v.\\n\\nState, \\n290 Ga. 1\\n, 4 (3) (\\n717 SE2d 453\\n) (2011); Hannah v. State, \\n278\\n\\nGa. 195\\n, 197 (2) (\\n599 SE2d 177\\n) (2004). But that conclusion does not\\n\\nfollow here where, in addition to failing to instruct the jury on the\\n\\ndefense of accident, the trial court instructed the jury to disregard\\n\\nthat accident was a key legal principle — even though Schmitt\\n\\ntestified that the collision was an accident, and during Schmitt’s\\n\\nclosing argument in response to a demonstrative slide defining\\n\\naccident as the lack of criminal intent. 15\\n\\n      Qualified jurors are presumed to follow jury instructions. See\\n\\nRobinson v. State, \\n308 Ga. 543\\n, 552 (2) (b) (ii) (\\n842 SE2d 54\\n) (2020).\\n\\n\\n\\n      15 Although the trial court directed that Schmitt could “argue that it was\\n\\nunintentional” such that he lacked the requisite criminal intent, this\\nclarification was outside the presence of the jury. Schmitt explained to the jury\\nthat “the principle [was] correct” that “[i]f this was an accident, if there was no\\ncriminal intent, then it’s not a crime.” But by then, the trial court had already\\ninstructed the jury to “disregard” that accident was a key legal principle in this\\ncase.\\n                                        24\\n Because the trial court instructed the jury to disregard accident as\\n\\na key legal principle, we assume that the jury followed this\\n\\ninstruction and so disregarded accident as a key legal principle in\\n\\nreaching the verdicts.\\n\\n     Moreover, the trial court’s failure to instruct the jury on the\\n\\ndefense of accident taken together with the trial court’s direction\\n\\nthat the jury “disregard” accident as a “key legal principle” meant\\n\\nthat the jury was not authorized to find that the collision was an\\n\\naccident. Although Schmitt presented evidence supporting his\\n\\naccident theory and advanced this theory in his opening statements,\\n\\nthroughout trial, and in his closing argument, the trial court refused\\n\\nthe instruction and so “deprived the jury of the necessary tools to\\n\\nevaluate the charges against [Schmitt] and to reach a verdict[.]”\\n\\nHenry v. State, \\n307 Ga. 140\\n, 146 (2) (c) (\\n834 SE2d 861\\n) (2019) (“[J]ury\\n\\ninstructions are the lamp to guide the jury’s feet in journeying\\n\\nthrough the testimony in search of a legal verdict.” (punctuation and\\n\\ncitation omitted)).\\n\\n     Under these circumstances, we cannot say that it is highly\\n\\n                                  25\\n probable that the trial court’s error in declining the accident\\n\\ninstruction did not contribute to the verdict for malice murder. We\\n\\ntherefore reverse Schmitt’s conviction as to this count.\\n\\n     (c) Schmitt also contends that the trial court erred in declining\\n\\nthe accident instruction as to the remaining counts, and that this\\n\\nerror was not harmless. We agree and accordingly reverse those\\n\\ncounts as well.\\n\\n     Because we reverse the malice murder conviction, the felony\\n\\nmurder counts predicated on aggravated assault are no longer\\n\\nvacated as a matter of law. See Clough v. State, \\n298 Ga. 594\\n, 597-\\n\\n598 (2) (\\n783 SE2d 637\\n) (2016) (considering impact of trial court’s\\n\\nfailure to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter as to vacated\\n\\nfelony murder counts, after concluding the malice murder conviction\\n\\nwas due to be reversed). Thus, we address whether the trial court\\n\\nerred in omitting the accident instruction as to those counts.\\n\\n     The indictment charged Schmitt with a total of five counts.\\n\\nCount 1 charged him with malice murder. Count 2 charged him with\\n\\nfelony murder predicated on aggravated assault as alleged in Count\\n\\n                                 26\\n 4, which alleged that he committed an assault on Jahangard’s\\n\\nperson with a motor vehicle by striking him with such vehicle.16\\n\\nCount 3 charged him with felony murder predicated on aggravated\\n\\nassault as alleged in Count 5, which alleged that he committed an\\n\\nassault on Jahangard’s person with a motor vehicle and by driving\\n\\ntowards     Jahangard,       thereby        placing   him     in   reasonable\\n\\napprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury. 17\\n\\n      In contrast to malice murder, “[p]roof of felony murder does not\\n\\nrequire proving malice or the intent to kill, but only that the\\n\\ndefendant had the requisite criminal intent to commit the\\n\\nunderlying felony.” Tessmer v. State, \\n273 Ga. 220\\n, 222 (2) (\\n539 SE2d\\n\\n816\\n) (2000) (citations and punctuation omitted); see also OCGA § 16-\\n\\n5-1 (c) (“A person commits the offense of murder when, in the\\n\\n\\n      16 Count 4 charged that Schmitt “did unlawfully commit an assault upon\\n\\nthe person of Hamid Jahangard with a motor vehicle, an object which when\\nused offensively against another is likely to result in serious bodily injury, by\\nstriking him with said motor vehicle[.]”\\n      17 Count 5 charged that Schmitt “did unlawfully commit an assault upon\\n\\nthe person of Hamid Jahangard with a motor vehicle, an object which when\\nused offensively against another is likely to result in serious bodily injury, by\\ndriving at toward and in the direction of the said Hamid Jahangard, said act\\nplacing him in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent\\ninjury[.]”\\n                                       27\\n commission of a felony, he or she causes the death of another human\\n\\nbeing irrespective of malice.” (emphasis added)). It follows, then, that\\n\\nalthough felony murder has no specific mens rea that accident can\\n\\ndefeat, accident can effectively act as a defense to felony murder\\n\\nwhen it is a defense to the predicate offense. See Tessmer, \\n273 Ga.\\n\\nat 222-223\\n (2) (identifying no error in charging the jury that accident\\n\\nwas not a defense to felony murder, given that the jury also was\\n\\ncharged that accident was a defense to the underlying felony of\\n\\naggravated assault and that it could not convict for felony murder\\n\\nunless defendant was found guilty of the underlying felony of\\n\\naggravated assault; noting that “mens rea is a necessary element of\\n\\naggravated assault”); see also Scott v. State, \\n306 Ga. 417\\n, 422-423\\n\\n(3) (\\n831 SE2d 813\\n) (2019) (holding trial court did not plainly err in\\n\\ninstructing the jury that “the defense of accident did not apply to\\n\\nfelony murder based on aggravated assault if the jury found that the\\n\\naggravated assault was intentional” (emphasis added)). And here,\\n\\nthe indictment predicated the two felony murder counts on the\\n\\noffense of aggravated assault.\\n\\n                                  28\\n      Aggravated assault has two elements: (1) the commission of a\\n\\nsimple assault under OCGA § 16-5-20 and (2) the presence of a\\n\\nstatutory aggravator. See OCGA § 16-5-21 (a). “[T]he simple assault\\n\\nencompassed within aggravated assault may be committed in two\\n\\nways: when a person ‘[a]ttempts to commit a violent injury to the\\n\\nperson of another,’ OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (1), or when a person\\n\\n‘[c]ommits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension\\n\\nof immediately receiving a violent injury. [OCGA § 16-5-20] (a) (2).’”\\n\\nKipp v. State, \\n294 Ga. 55\\n, 59 (2) (a) (\\n751 SE2d 83\\n) (2013).\\n\\n     The substance of Count 4 alleged that Schmitt committed a\\n\\nsimple assault under OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (1), and the substance of\\n\\nCount 5 alleged that Schmitt committed a simple assault under\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (2). In both counts, the statutory aggravator\\n\\nalleged is that Schmitt committed assault “with a motor vehicle, an\\n\\nobject which when used offensively against another is likely to result\\n\\nin serious bodily injury[.]” See OCGA § 16-5-21 (a) (2). Against this\\n\\nbackdrop, and considering that “[the] accident defense applies where\\n\\nthe evidence negates the defendant’s criminal intent, whatever that\\n\\n                                 29\\n intent element is for the crime at issue,” Ogilvie, \\n292 Ga. at 9\\n (2) (b),\\n\\nwe address separately the aggravated assault allegations in Counts\\n\\n4 and 5.\\n\\n     (i) Aggravated Assault as Alleged in Count 4\\n\\n     The crime of simple assault as set forth in OCGA § 16-5-20 (a)\\n\\n(1) requires “the presence of criminal intent[.]” Kipp, \\n294 Ga. at 59\\n\\n\\n(2) (a). There must be an “intent to cause harm[,]” which refers “to\\n\\nthe requisite mens rea of intent” and also “to a defendant’s\\n\\ndeliberate purpose to accomplish an injurious result.” State v.\\n\\nSpringer, \\n297 Ga. 376\\n, 381 (1) (\\n774 SE2d 106\\n) (2015).\\n\\n     Here, as set forth above, more than slight evidence negated\\n\\nthat Schmitt acted with the intent to cause harm or with the\\n\\ndeliberate purpose of harming Jahangard. Because more than slight\\n\\nevidence negated that Schmitt acted with the requisite criminal\\n\\nintent, the trial court erred in declining the accident instruction as\\n\\nto Counts 2 and 4.\\n\\n     (ii) Aggravated Assault as Alleged in Count 5\\n\\n     The crime of simple assault as set forth in OCGA § 16-5-20 (a)\\n\\n                                   30\\n (2) requires the State to prove that the defendant acted with\\n\\ncriminal intent to commit the act which caused the victim to be\\n\\nreasonably apprehensive of receiving a violent injury. See Patterson\\n\\nv. State, \\n299 Ga. 491\\n, 493 (\\n789 SE2d 175\\n) (2016) (holding that the\\n\\nState need not prove the defendant driver acted with a specific\\n\\nintent to place the victim in such apprehension when “evidence of\\n\\n[the defendant’s] intent to drive the vehicle as he did [was]\\n\\nundisputed”); see also Stobbart v. State, \\n272 Ga. 608\\n, 611 (3) (\\n533\\n\\nSE2d 379\\n) (2000) (“There is an intent of the accused that must be\\n\\nshown, but it is only the criminal intent to commit the acts which\\n\\ncaused the victim to be reasonably apprehensive of receiving a\\n\\nviolent injury[.]” (emphasis added; citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)).\\n\\n     The State contends, and Schmitt concedes, that Patterson\\n\\nprecluded the accident instruction as to Counts 3 and 5, because\\n\\nSchmitt intended to do the act which placed Jahangard in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                31\\n reasonable apprehension of immediate violent injury. 18 Both parties\\n\\nappear to interpret Patterson to mean that because Schmitt\\n\\nintended to turn his car, an accident instruction was improper as to\\n\\nthese counts because the State did not have to prove that Schmitt\\n\\nacted with the specific intent to place Jahangard in reasonable\\n\\napprehension of immediate violent injury. But that construction\\n\\nomits altogether the requirement that a defendant act with criminal\\n\\nintent in committing the act which places another in such\\n\\napprehension.\\n\\n      In Patterson, during an argument in which the victim asked\\n\\nPatterson to leave, “Patterson went to his vehicle, put it into gear,\\n\\nrevved the engine, and rapidly drove directly toward the end of the\\n\\nhome, near [the victim], who became pinned against the side of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      18 In his brief and at oral argument, Schmitt conceded that Patterson was\\n\\nbinding as to Counts 3 and 5, such that the trial court did not err in declining\\nthe accident instruction as to those counts. Instead of arguing that Patterson\\ndoes not preclude the accident defense as to these counts, Schmitt asked that\\nwe overrule Patterson. But we are not required to accept a party’s concession\\non a matter of law. And because Patterson as we explain it today did not\\npreclude the accident defense as to these counts, we do not reach the question\\nof reconsidering it.\\n                                      32\\n home by the vehicle[.]” \\n299 Ga. at 491\\n. Patterson’s criminal intent\\n\\nin performing these acts was clear: “evidence of Patterson’s intent to\\n\\ndrive the vehicle as he did [was] undisputed.” \\nId. at 493\\n (emphasis\\n\\nadded). Thus, the requirement that Patterson act with criminal\\n\\nintent as he did the act which placed the victim in such\\n\\napprehension was satisfied.\\n\\n     In contrast, at least some evidence supports Schmitt’s claim\\n\\nthat, although he intended to turn his car, he did not intend to turn\\n\\nit in the way that he did, so he did not have criminal intent. Because\\n\\nat least slight evidence created such a question as to whether\\n\\nSchmitt acted with the requisite intent, the trial court erred in\\n\\ndeclining the accident instruction as to Counts 3 and 5.\\n\\n     Finally, for the same reasons as above, the trial court’s error in\\n\\ndeclining the accident instruction as to Counts 2, 3, 4, and 5 was not\\n\\nharmless, and so we reverse those counts.\\n\\n     Judgment reversed.

CALHOUN v. HARRELL.\\n\\n      BARNES, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      Marion D. Calhoun appeals from a Stalking Three Year Protective Order\\n\\nentered against her and in favor of Carlotta Harrell. Calhoun contends that her\\n\\nconduct at issue – posting to Facebook comments relating to Harrell, the Chair of the\\n\\nHenry County Board of Commissioners – amounted to engaging in constitutionally\\n\\nprotected political speech and was, at any rate, insufficient to authorize the order.1\\n\\nBecause we find merit in Calhoun’s argument that the evidence was insufficient, we\\n\\nreverse.\\n\\n\\n      1\\n        Calhoun appealed to this Court, and we transferred the case to our Supreme\\nCourt on the basis that Calhoun’s arguments raised a constitutional question within\\nthat Court’s exclusive appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court transferred the case\\nback to this Court, determining that this case does not fall within that scope.\\n       As background, it is undisputed that Harrell procured in 2021 a one-year\\n\\nstalking protective order against Calhoun.2 The record shows that the following year,\\n\\nin May 2022, Harrell returned to court and filed, expressly pursuant to OCGA § 16-5-\\n\\n943 and 19-13-4,4 the petition that led to the now contested three-year protective order.\\n\\nIn support of that petition, Harrell swore, “Calhoun has continued to make posting[s]\\n\\non social media that have an undertone of violence. . . . I continue to be in constant\\n\\nfear of my life and safety because of the constant stalking of Ms. Calhoun via social\\n\\nmedia.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2\\n          The one-year protective order has not been made a part of the appellate\\nrecord.\\n      3\\n        OCGA § 16-5-94 provides that “[a] person who is not a minor who alleges\\nstalking by another person may seek a restraining order by filing a petition alleging\\nconduct constituting stalking as defined in Code Section 16-5-90.” OCGA § 16-5-94\\n(a). The statute provides further that “[t]he court may grant a protective order . . . to\\nbring about a cessation of conduct constituting stalking.” OCGA § 16-5-94 (d).\\n      4\\n        OCGA § 19-13-4 provides for the granting of protective orders “to bring about\\na cessation of acts of family violence.” OCGA § 19-13-4 (a). While there was no\\nallegation nor any evidence that Calhoun and Harrell were members of the same\\nfamily, OCGA § 16-5-94 (e) states that designated subsections of “19-13-4 . . . relating\\nto family violence petitions, shall apply to petitions filed pursuant to this Code\\nsection[.]”\\n                                           2\\n       On June 27, 2022, the trial court convened a hearing. The judge delineated from\\n\\nthe bench that she was specifically interested in “what’s happened between [the time\\n\\nthe one-year protective order had issued] and now.”\\n\\n      Harrell began her case by calling Calhoun to the stand. During such cross-\\n\\nexamination, Calhoun described herself as a Black community activist; and she\\n\\nadmitted that she had posted to Facebook a series of comments about Harrell, who is\\n\\nalso Black. In response to various questions, Calhoun admitted that in a February\\n\\n2022 post, she called Harrell and another individual “snakes”;5 that in a different\\n\\nFebruary 2022 post, she called Harrell and another individual “MFERS” who had\\n\\n\\n      5\\n          The exhibit associated with this testimony showed that Calhoun’s post\\nincluded:\\n        A real community activist makes noise in their community MOST OF\\n        THE TIME WHILE STANDING ALONE. I’M THAT BLACK\\n        QUEEN. . . I have a right to my voice my opinion and the right to speak\\n        freely about issues that concern me and my community. Henry County\\n        Georgia our government is being monopolize for a few black democrats\\n        aiding and abetting white folks to suppress our votes and our forward\\n        progress.\\nWith photographs apparently depicting Harrell and other individuals, Calhoun’s\\nFacebook post continued: “THESE 2 SMILING BLACK FACES TELL LIES,\\nTHEY ARE WORKING TO SUPPRESS OUR VOTES WITH A REPUBLICON\\nJUST SO THEY CAN STAY IN POWER. They are willing to have me jailed on false\\nstalking charges becuz I’m exposing them for SNAKES that are. They know where\\nI live, come get me, im not running nor hiding.”\\n                                         3\\n come from “traitorous ancestors”;6 that in another February 2022 post, she talked\\n\\nabout Harrell’s “blood line”;7 that in other February 2022 posts, she commented\\n\\nabout Black politicians in Henry County;8 that in a March 2022 post, she referred to\\n\\nHarrell’s father as “just another dam pimp in the pulpit”; that in a March 2022 post,\\n\\nshe said that Black politicians in the county could come get her because they knew\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      6\\n        The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun’s post included: “[Both Harrell\\nand another identified politician] are crooked manipulative lying evil selfish garbage\\nthat reap with stinch. . . In my opinion, the both of you come from a long line of\\ntraitorous ancestors . . . WHAT A DAM BLOOD LINE.”\\n      7\\n         The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun wrote in her post: “The\\nChairwoman of Henry County Ga is a DAM FOOL! Black History is the perfect time\\nto reflect up those black folks like her from the beginning of slavery who had no dam\\nproblem selling other black into slavery, guess her bloodline is generational[.]”\\n      8\\n        The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun posted commentary that “[a\\nnamed state senator] and Henry County Chairwoman Harrell are underwriting the\\nguidelines to suppress the black votes for their own selfish gain” and that “[t]his is\\nwhat I got to say about some of our black politicians in Henry County, Ga. . . if you\\nwant to accuse me of stalking your ass, come get me, you know where I am . . . our\\nvotes are not only being suppressed by white politicians but also by black politicians\\nas well and that’s a dam shame. . . Many of our elected leaders or church leaders\\nwon’t speak out about this corruption and voter suppression but I will[.]”\\n                                          4\\n where she was;9 that in an April 2022 post, she said that Harrell was a “skunk”;10 that\\n\\nin another post, she described Harrell as a “piece of crap”;11 that in other posts\\n\\nbetween August 2021 and April 2022, she characterized Harrell’s mode as “fetching\\n\\nand stepping,”12 “skinning and grinning,”13 and being a “house Negro.”14 When\\n\\n      9\\n         The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun wrote, in part: “. . . so if the\\nchairwoman of Henry County of any of these other corrupt politicians want to try and\\njail me or worse . . . you know where I am, I live, breath and talk in plain sight.”\\n      10\\n        The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun’s post included commentary that\\n“[several individuals] and Chairwoman Carlotta Harrell run together like a pack of\\ninfectous skunks, they all smell of corruption[.]”\\n      11\\n         The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun wrote that a certain judge, a\\n“Republican . . . whom I believe is an unfair judge, sent me a gleefully robo text\\nendorsement he got from Carlotta Harrell, who I believe is a lying manipulative piece\\nof crap who happens to be the chair person of Henry County and a Democrat in name\\nonly[.]”\\n      12\\n         The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun wrote, in part, that “[a certain\\njudge], a REPUBLICAN is running for reelection in Henry County in a non partisan\\nrace, so he doesn’t have to state his party affiliation. . . . Below the chairwoman of\\nHenry County and Democrat in name only endorsing this judge, for favors no doubt\\nhe has done for her in the past. . . . I can only imagine how many people came before\\nhim and the outcomes were not fair. White folks have a problem with teaching\\nCRITICAL RACE THEORY BUT HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH BLACK FOLKS\\nSTILL PRACTICING THE ‘FETCH AND STEP’ to aid them.” (This exhibit was\\naccompanied by photographs.)\\n      13\\n       The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun wrote, in part: “Carlotta Harrell\\nhas made sure minority representation is a bare minimum in Henry County\\ngovernment . . . case in point, she forced the black fire chief to resign so she can play\\n                                            5\\n asked whether she had meant her name-calling as compliments, as fighting words, or\\n\\nas something else, Calhoun’s response included: “[Harrell] knows why I wrote that.\\n\\nShe’s black.”\\n\\n      When Harrell took the stand, she testified that she was the Chairman of the\\n\\nBoard of Commissioners in Henry County, but had brought the action in her private\\n\\ncapacity explaining that “[i]t’s about my safety”; that she was afraid of Calhoun; and\\n\\nthat she considered certain of Calhoun’s name-calling to be fighting words and as\\n\\n“words of incitement” intended “to rile up the Black community to attack [her].”\\n\\nHarrell further testified that Calhoun’s “going after [her] family” was something\\n\\nCalhoun had added since the previous protective order. When asked how she felt\\n\\nabout Calhoun’s posts collectively, Harrell responded,\\n\\n      I feel threatened. I feel that my life is threatened. . . . And now . . . she’s\\n      talking about my father who was a pastor of a church of 40 years. She\\n\\n\\n\\n‘footsies with the white RepubliCONS in Henry County[’] . . . Here she stands\\n‘skinning and grinning[‘] with the interim fire chief a white man she chose over all\\nother minorities just as qualified. . . .” (Pictures accompanied this post.)\\n      14\\n        The associated exhibit showed that Calhoun wrote, in part: “Chairwoman\\nHarrell & [a specified state senator] your roles in trying to make the Henry County\\nBoard of Commissioners white again MAKES THE BOTH OF YOU THE BIGGEST\\nHOUSE NEGROES AND BIGGEST LOSERS[.]”\\n                                            6\\n       doesn’t even know my father. . . . She knows nothing about me. She just\\n      seems to be a very angry person, and I consider her to be a threat to my\\n      life.\\n\\n\\n      When Calhoun returned to the stand for direct examination, she testified, “I’m\\n\\na community activist, and I say what the community needs to hear about corrupt\\n\\npoliticians,” and she pointed out that she had posted to Facebook her opinions about\\n\\nseveral other elected officials. Calhoun further testified, “That’s what community\\n\\nactivists do. I exercised my First Amendment right in strong terms, but it does not\\n\\nmean that I want to hurt [Harrell].” As she described herself, “I’m a good person who\\n\\nhas chosen as her life work to be a voice of the people, a steward of government, and\\n\\na good person in my community who is willing to help others in need[.]” Calhoun\\n\\ngave examples of programs she had started, including creating a softball league for\\n\\ngirls, initiating programs to address drug addiction suffered by certain individuals,\\n\\nassisting with the start-up of a county drug court, and helping probationers such that\\n\\nimprisonment was “the last resort.” She explained, “I’m very vocal because I’m very\\n\\nconcerned about what happens to the people, and it has nothing to do with me wanting\\n\\nto hurt Carlotta Harrell, but it’s about making the people understand that they have\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          7\\n rights[.]” She testified, “I must let the people know, and I’m not gonna always be Ms.\\n\\nPretty Pretty about a word,” but “I mean [Harrell] no harm whatsoever.”\\n\\n      At the end of the hearing, the trial court announced its finding that Calhoun’s\\n\\nuse of certain language in the Facebook posts was in violation of the stalking statute,\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-90.15 Reciting from that statute, the court expounded:\\n\\n      It says – and this is the Code Section on stalking – harassing and\\n      intimidating another person, and then it says, it means knowingly and\\n      willful course of conduct directed at a specific person which causes\\n      emotional distress by placing and such person in reasonable fear . . . . It’s\\n      your language that is the problem here. I’m going to extend the\\n      restraining order. It doesn’t mean to say that you can’t say, Vote against\\n      [Harrell]. Run against her. That’s fine. But when you start using that foul\\n      language, you’ve got a problem. That’s where the problem lies, not in\\n\\n\\n      15\\n           OCGA § 16-5-90 (a) (1) states that\\n\\n      A person commits the offense of stalking when he or she follows, places\\n      under surveillance, or contacts another person at or about a place or\\n      places without the consent of the other person for the purpose of\\n      harassing and intimidating the other person. . . . For the purposes of this\\n      article, the term “harassing and intimidating” means a knowing and\\n      willful course of conduct directed at a specific person which causes\\n      emotional distress by placing such person in reasonable fear for such\\n      person’s safety or the safety of a member of his or her immediate family,\\n      by establishing a pattern of harassing and intimidating behavior, and\\n      which serves no legitimate purpose.\\n                                           8\\n       what you’re trying to do. . . . You call them snakes. You call them just\\n      the vilest names I can think of, and you can’t do that.\\n\\n\\nThe court acknowledged to Calhoun that “[y]ou do a lot of good,” but suggested,\\n\\n“You need to start being pretty pretty about words. Some of it comes from the\\n\\nrecipient as a threat.” Referring to one specific Facebook post,16 the court said to\\n\\nCalhoun, “[W]hen you start talking about crooked, manipulative, lying, evil, selfish\\n\\ngarbage, you’ve gone beyond the way you need to be. That’s threatening. That\\n\\nviolates the Code.”\\n\\n      That same day, June 27, 2022, the contested Stalking Three Year Protective\\n\\nOrder was entered.\\n\\n      In this appeal, Calhoun contends that the superior court abused its discretion\\n\\nin granting the protective order.17 Calhoun concedes that she made the Facebook posts\\n\\nand that – as she puts it – “[her] criticisms were blunt, sometimes crude or insulting,\\n\\n\\n      16\\n           See footnote 6, supra.\\n      17\\n         See Lewis v. Lewis, \\n316 Ga. App. 67\\n, 68 (\\n728 SE2d 741\\n) (2012) (“The grant\\nor denial of a motion for a protective order lies within the sound discretion of the trial\\ncourt, and its decision on such a motion will not be reversed absent an abuse of that\\ndiscretion. An abuse of discretion occurs where a ruling is unsupported by any\\nevidence of record or where that ruling misstates or misapplies the relevant law.”)\\n(citations and punctuation omitted).\\n                                            9\\n and sometimes profane.” However, she argues that the trial court erred by\\n\\ndetermining that the posts rose to the level of stalking, given the lack of a “direct\\n\\ncommunication from [her] solely to Ms. Harrell.” As Calhoun claims, her Facebook\\n\\nposts were “about Harrell and her associates, but [were] directed to the public, and\\n\\nconcern[ed] Ms. Harrell’s conduct as a public figure.” Calhoun thus characterizes her\\n\\ncommentary as political and intended to influence public opinion and voters. She\\n\\nadditionally contends that “[her] activism in the form of Facebook posts advocating\\n\\nfor change in local politics is speech protected by the United States Constitution and\\n\\nthe Georgia Constitution” and that she cannot “be silenced through the use of a\\n\\nStalking Three Year Protective Order, as is made clear by OCGA § 16-5-92.”18\\n\\n      1. We turn first to Calhoun’s contention that the evidence was insufficient19\\n\\nbecause an element of stalking under OCGA § 16-5-90 was not established.\\n\\n\\n\\n      18\\n         OCGA 16-5-92 provides in full: “The provisions of Code Sections 16-5-90\\nand 16-5-91 shall not apply to persons engaged in activities protected by the\\nConstitution of the United States or of this state or to persons or employees of such\\npersons lawfully engaged in bona fide business activity or lawfully engaged in the\\npractice of a profession.”\\n      19\\n         “In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we construe the evidence in\\nfavor of the findings of the trier of fact.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Bodi v.\\nRyan, \\n358 Ga. App. 267\\n, 267 (\\n855 SE2d 11\\n) (2021).\\n                                          10\\n       “In order to obtain a protective order based on stalking, the petitioner must\\n\\nestablish the elements of the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.” Pilcher v.\\n\\nStribling, \\n282 Ga. 166\\n, 167 (\\n647 SE2d 8\\n) (2007). In pertinent part, the stalking statute\\n\\nprovides, “A person commits the offense of stalking when he or she follows, places\\n\\nunder surveillance, or contacts another person at or about a place or places without\\n\\nthe consent of the other person for the purpose of harassing and intimidating the other\\n\\nperson.” OCGA § 16-5-90 (a) (1). Calhoun posits that there was no allegation nor any\\n\\nevidence that she either followed Harrell or placed her under surveillance.20 And\\n\\nrelying on Chan v. Ellis, \\n296 Ga. 838\\n (\\n770 SE2d 851\\n) (2015), Calhoun argues that the\\n\\nevidence failed to establish “contact” for purposes of the stalking statute.\\n\\n      We find merit in Calhoun’s argument that in light of Chan, \\n296 Ga. 838\\n, Harrell\\n\\nfailed to adduce evidence sufficient to establish that Calhoun contacted her in a\\n\\nmanner prohibited by the stalking statute. In Chan, the Supreme Court of Georgia\\n\\nexplained,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      20\\n        Harrell makes no claim on appeal that she alleged or evinced that Calhoun\\nfollowed her or placed her under surveillance. And for reasons discussed below, we\\nreject Harrell’s arguments for an affirmance of the trial court’s judgment.\\n                                           11\\n       For purposes of the [stalking] statute, one “contacts another person”\\n      when he [or she] “communicates with another person” through any\\n      medium, including an electronic medium. See OCGA § 16-5-90 (a) (1).\\n      See also Johnson v. State, \\n264 Ga. 590\\n, 591 (1) (\\n449 SE2d 94\\n) (1994) (as\\n      used in OCGA § 16-5-90, “[t]o ‘contact’ is readily understood by people\\n      of ordinary intelligence as meaning ‘to get in touch with; communicate\\n      with’ “ (citation and punctuation omitted)). Although one may\\n      “contact” another for the purposes of the statute by communicating\\n      with the other person through any medium, it nevertheless is essential\\n      that the communication be directed specifically to that other person, as\\n      opposed to a communication that is only directed generally to the public.\\n      Common and customary usage suggests as much, as does another\\n      provision of the stalking law, which defines “harassing and intimidating”\\n      in terms of “a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific\\n      person.” OCGA § 16-5-90 (a) (1) (emphasis supplied).\\n\\n\\n(Footnotes omitted; emphasis in original.) Chan, \\n296 Ga. at 839-840\\n (1). As Chan\\n\\nfurther explained, “That a communication is about a particular person does not mean\\n\\nnecessarily that it is directed to that person.” (Emphasis in original.) \\nId. 840\\n (2). For\\n\\ninstance, Chan noted, “[a]n ordinary speaker of the English language typically would\\n\\nnot say . . . that a popular author had ‘contacted’ or ‘communicated with’ the speaker\\n\\nsimply because the speaker had read a book written by the author.” \\nId. at 840\\n (1), n.\\n\\n6.\\n\\n                                           12\\n       Upon reviewing the evidence in Chan, our High Court described that the record\\n\\nshowed that\\n\\n      [the appellant] and others posted a lot of commentary to his website\\n      about [the appellee], but it fails for the most part to show that the\\n      commentary was directed specifically to [appellee] as opposed to the\\n      public. As written, most of the posts appear to speak to the public, not to\\n      [appellee] in particular, even if they are about [appellee]. And there is no\\n      evidence that [appellant] did anything to cause these posts to be\\n      delivered to [appellee] or otherwise brought to her attention,\\n      notwithstanding that [appellant] may have reasonably anticipated that\\n      [appellee] might come across the posts, just as any member of the\\n      Internet-using public might.\\n\\n\\nChen, \\n296 Ga. at 841\\n (2). Holding that “[t]he publication of commentary directed only\\n\\nto the public generally does not amount to ‘contact,’ as that term is used in OCGA §\\n\\n16-5-90 (a) (1),” Chen concluded that “[appellee] failed to prove that [appellant]\\n\\n‘contacted’ her without her consent, and [that] the trial court erred when it concluded\\n\\nthat [appellant] had stalked [appellee].” Id. at 842 (3).\\n\\n      Guided by Chen, this Court reached a similar conclusion in Bodi v. Ryan, \\n358\\n\\nGa. App. 267\\n (\\n855 SE2d 11\\n) (2021). In Bodi, the appellee procured a stalking\\n\\nprotective order based upon the appellant’s post on Snapchat’s social media\\n\\n\\n                                           13\\n platform.21 \\nId. at 268\\n. This Court noted that the appellant had called the appellee an\\n\\nobscene name and included on his social media post that he wished appellee would\\n\\ndie. \\nId. at 270\\n (b). However, this Court found no evidence that the appellant had been\\n\\nsurveilling or following the appellant, and no evidence that the appellant had either\\n\\ncontacted appellee or sent her the social media post. \\nId. at 270\\n (a). Reciting Chen’s\\n\\nprinciple that “[t]he fact that [appellant] could have reasonably expected that [the\\n\\nappellant] might discover the posts is insufficient to establish ‘contact’ under the\\n\\nstatute,” \\nid. at 270\\n (a), this Court ultimately concluded that the appellee “[did] not\\n\\nestablish the necessary contact to rise to the level of stalking,” \\nid. at 269\\n (a), and that\\n\\nthe trial court thus abused its discretion in granting the protective order. \\nId. at 271\\n (b).\\n\\n       In the instant case, Calhoun admittedly posted to Facebook commentary about\\n\\nHarrell (and associated individuals), but the record “fails for the most part to show\\n\\n       21\\n         The Snapchat post contained the following commentary (which also\\npublicized the appellee’s daughter’s hospitalization):\\n\\n       [F]--- you. Suck a fat-ass dick. Stupid ass bitch, you want to stalk my\\n       f---ing Snapchat story and keep your daughter in a mental hospital? Stalk\\n       this, you f---ing retarded bitch. You’re going to die the worst way there\\n       is to die, and I am praying for it. F--- you, doing the most.\\n\\nBodi, 358 Ga. App. at 268.\\n\\n\\n                                            14\\n that the commentary was directed specifically to [Harrell] as opposed to the public.\\n\\nAs written, most of the posts appear to speak to the public, not to [Harrell] in\\n\\nparticular, even if they are about [Harrell].” Chen, \\n296 Ga. at 841\\n (2). Moreover, the\\n\\nrecord does not show that “[Calhoun] did anything to cause [her] posts to be\\n\\ndelivered to [Harrell] or otherwise brought to her attention, notwithstanding that\\n\\n[Calhoun] may have reasonably anticipated that [Harrell] might come across [her]\\n\\nposts, just as any member of the Internet-using public might.” \\nId.\\n As held by Chen,\\n\\n“[t]he publication of commentary directed only to the public generally does not\\n\\namount to ‘contact’” under the stalking statute. \\nId.\\n “Although our standard of review\\n\\nis deferential, where, as here, there is [insufficient] evidence to support the [stalking]\\n\\ncharge, and there is not an issue of witness credibility, we are constrained to reverse”\\n\\nthe Stalking Three Year Protective Order.

Here, the trial court conducted a hearing;\\n\\nHarrell did not claim entitlement to extended protection as a matter of any statutory\\n\\npresumption; rather, in support of her sworn allegation of “constant stalking of Ms.\\n\\nCalhoun via social media,” Harrell presented at the hearing evidence of Calhoun’s\\n\\nnumerous Facebook postings; and as detailed above, the trial court granted a three-\\n\\nyear stalking protective order based on an erroneous conclusion that Calhoun’s social\\n\\nmedia commentary constituted stalking.\\n\\n      Given these circumstances, Harrell’s newly asserted, unsupported position that\\n\\n“[t]he law presumes that the previous order will be converted” does not provide a\\n\\nbasis for nevertheless affirming the judgment.

Given our holding in Division 1, supra, it is not necessary to reach Calhoun’s\\n\\nremaining (constitutional) challenge to the Stalking Three Year Protective Order. See\\n\\nHerbert v. Jordan, \\n348 Ga. App. 538\\n, 539 (2) (\\n823 SE2d 852\\n) (2019) (reversing stalking\\n\\nprotective orders on one ground and, thus, declining to address remaining challenges\\n\\nto such orders).\\n\\n      Judgment reversed. Gobeil, J., concurs fully and specially. Pipkin, J., dissents.\\n  A23A0279. CALHOUN v. HARRELL.\\n\\n      GOBEIL, Judge, concurring fully and specially.\\n\\n      While I concur fully with the result reached in this case, I write separately to\\n\\nnote that our decision should not be read as implying that social media posts\\n\\ncategorically cannot be used in violation of anti-stalking laws — or other laws for that\\n\\nmatter (like incitement to an illegal act). In this case, Calhoun’s words and actions —\\n\\nas offensive and understandably unsettling as they are — simply fail to rise to the level\\n\\nof “contact” for stalking given the holdings in Chan and Bodi.\\n  A23A0279. CALHOUN v. HARRELL.\\n\\n      PIPKIN, Judge, dissenting.\\n\\n      Relying on Chan v. Ellis, \\n296 Ga. 838\\n (\\n770 SE2d 851\\n) (2015), the majority\\n\\nconcludes that there was insufficient evidence that Calhoun “contacted” Harrell to\\n\\nsatisfy OCGA § 16-5-90 (a) (1). However, when the evidence is viewed in the\\n\\nappropriate light, Chan is distinguishable from this case. Consequently, I would defer\\n\\nto the trial court’s substantial discretion and affirm the determination that Calhoun\\n\\ndid, in fact, repeatedly “contact” Harrell “for the purposes of harassing and\\n\\nintimidating” her. For these reasons, I must dissent.\\n       In Chan v. Ellis, Matthew Chan’s website had become a repository for criticism\\n\\nof a poet and her efforts to enforce the copyright on her work; the website featured\\n\\n“2,000 posts” about the poet, “some of which [were] distasteful and crude.” Chan,\\n\\n770 Ga. 838\\n. The Chan Court explained, however, that, even where “a\\n\\ncommunication is about a particular person [that it ] does not mean necessarily that it\\n\\nis directed to that person.” Id. at 840 (2). And, the evidence in that case “fail[ed] for\\n\\nthe most part to show that the commentary was directed specifically to [the poet] as\\n\\nopposed to the public.” Id. at 841 (2).\\n\\n      The posts in this case, on the other hand, were not limited to someone’s\\n\\npersonal website; instead, Calhoun used social media, namely, Facebook to target\\n\\nHarrell. Consistent with the design of social media, a number of Calhoun’s posts\\n\\n“tag” dozens of other Facebook users and utilize numerous “hashtags,” both of\\n\\nwhich would be designed to enlarge the audience of her posts; it would be reasonable\\n\\nto infer that these tactics were also designed to reach Harrell, especially given that\\n\\nmany of the posts are directed at Harrell and a number are written in the second\\n\\nperson. Thus, construing the evidence in favor of the findings of the trier of fact, as\\n\\nwe must, I disagree with the majority opinion that “the record does not show that\\n\\nCalhoun did anything to cause her posts to be delivered to Harrell or otherwise\\n                                           2\\n brought to her attention.” In fact, the record shows that Harrell’s sister became aware\\n\\nof the posts and issued a response; Calhoun then quoted that response in a subsequent\\n\\npost and used it to continue her barrage of words toward Harrell.\\n\\n      While I recognize that we must be mindful of restricting speech, Calhoun’s\\n\\nnumerous posts are filled with grotesque racial attacks and unsubstantiated allegations\\n\\nof criminal conduct, which target both Harrell and her family. Further, the undisputed\\n\\nevidence established that Harrell feared for her safety and that she felt threatened by\\n\\nCalhoun. In light of the evidence presented to the trial court below, it is imperative\\n\\nthat we abide by our well-established standard of review and uphold the trial court’s\\n\\nsound exercise of its discretion.\\n\\n      Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           3\\n '),\n",

KENNETH GRAVITT v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      On February 16, 2024, the trial court entered an order revoking a portion of\\nKenneth Gravitt’s probation for violating a special condition of his probation. On\\nMarch 28, 2024, the trial court entered a “Consent Order to Modify Probation\\nOrder,” clarifying the revocation. Gravitt filed a pro se notice of appeal seeking to\\nappeal the probation revocation order on May 6, 2024. We lack jurisdiction for at least\\ntwo reasons.\\n      First, appeals from probation revocation orders must be made by application for\\ndiscretionary appeal. See OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5); Jones v. State, \\n322 Ga. App. 269\\n, 269\\nn. 2 (\\n745 SE2d 1\\n) (2013). Compliance with the discretionary appeals procedure is\\njurisdictional. Hair Restoration Specialists v.

App. 901\\n, 903\\n(\\n862 SE2d 564\\n) (2021) (failure to comply with the discretionary appeal procedure,\\nwhere applicable, requires dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction). Thus,\\nGravitt’s failure to follow the proper procedure deprives us of jurisdiction over this\\nappeal.\\n      Second, even if a direct appeal were proper in this case, Gravitt’s appeal is\\nuntimely. A notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of the judgment or\\ntrial court order sought to be appealed. OCGA § 5-6-38 (a). The proper and timely\\nfiling of a notice of appeal is an absolute requirement to confer jurisdiction upon an\\nappellate court. Redford v. State, \\n357 Ga. App. 247\\n, 250 (\\n850 SE2d 447\\n) (2020).\\nGravitt’s notice of appeal was untimely, as it was filed 39 days after entry of the trial\\ncourt’s modification order.\\n      For each of the foregoing reasons, we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal,\\nwhich is hereby DISMISSED.\\n\\n                                      Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\n                                        Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\\n                                                                    07/10/2024\\n                                                 I certify that the above is a true extract from\\n                                      the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\n                                                Witness my signature and the seal of said court\\n                                      hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                        , Clerk.\\n '),\n",

THE STATE v. CALDWELL.\\n\\n      MILLER, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      Following a traffic stop, Tasha Caldwell was charged with possession of a\\n\\nfirearm during the commission of a felony and violation of the Georgia Controlled\\n\\nSubstances Act. The State appeals from the trial court’s order granting Caldwell’s\\n\\nmotion to suppress and the order denying its motion for reconsideration, arguing that\\n\\nthe trial court erred by (1) determining that law enforcement lacked probable cause to\\n\\nsearch the vehicle; (2) concluding that the driver’s consent to search did not extend\\n\\nto all containers in the vehicle; (3) ruling that Caldwell did not consent to a search of\\n\\nthe vehicle; (4) concluding that law enforcement acted improperly by requesting\\n\\nidentification; (5) determining that law enforcement cannot order passengers to exit\\n a vehicle; and (6) concluding that the consent to search the vehicle was the product\\n\\nof an illegal detention. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court’s order\\n\\ngranting Caldwell’s motion to suppress.\\n\\n      The following principles guide our review in this matter:\\n\\n      In a hearing on a motion to suppress, the trial court sits as the trier of fact\\n      and its findings are analogous to a jury verdict. Accordingly, we defer to\\n      the trial court’s credibility determinations and will not disturb its factual\\n      findings in the absence of clear error. And when reviewing the grant or\\n      denial of a motion to suppress, an appellate court must construe the\\n      evidentiary record in the light most favorable to the trial court’s factual\\n      findings and judgment. Additionally, as a general rule, appellate courts\\n      must limit their consideration of the disputed facts to those expressly\\n      found by the trial court. An appellate court may, however, consider facts\\n      that definitively can be ascertained exclusively by reference to evidence\\n      that is uncontradicted and presents no questions of credibility, such as\\n      facts indisputably discernible from a videotape. Finally, although we\\n      defer to the trial court’s factfinding, we owe no deference to the trial\\n      court’s legal conclusions. Instead, we independently apply the law to the\\n      facts as found by the trial court.\\n\\n\\n(Citation omitted.) State v. Bly, \\n367 Ga. App. 786\\n, 787 (\\n888 SE2d 593\\n) (2023).\\n\\n      So viewed, the evidentiary record, which includes the responding officer’s\\n\\ntestimony and video footage of the traffic stop, shows the following. On April 9, 2021,\\n\\n                                            2\\n Deputy Reece of the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office initiated a traffic stop of a\\n\\nvehicle after observing that the driver was not wearing his seatbelt. Deputy Reece\\n\\napproached the vehicle and made contact with Daniel Murray, the driver, and\\n\\nCaldwell, who was seated in the front passenger’s seat. As Deputy Reece requested\\n\\nMurray’s and Caldwell’s driver’s licenses, he noticed that Murray’s hands shook\\n\\n“uncontrollably.” Deputy Reece noticed that the car had an out-of-state license plate,\\n\\nso after he obtained the driver’s licenses, he asked them if they were Georgia\\n\\nresidents, and Murray said that he and Caldwell had recently relocated to Georgia\\n\\nfrom Indiana. Deputy Reece asked Murray whether marijuana was legal in Indiana and\\n\\nwhether he had “anything in the car.” He then asked Murray for consent to search\\n\\nthe vehicle, and Murray replied, “if you want to,” which all occurred less than two\\n\\nminutes after the traffic stop. Deputy Reece asked Murray about his “pot” sunglasses\\n\\nthat apparently had depictions or drawings of marijuana on them, when he had last\\n\\n“smoked weed,” and whether there was a marijuana “roach” in the car. Deputy\\n\\nReece, however, did not detect any odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle.\\n\\nMurray then reached into the front console of the vehicle and handed a roach to\\n\\nDeputy Reece. Deputy Reece removed Murray from the vehicle, and Murray\\n\\n\\n                                          3\\n informed Deputy Reece that he was a convicted felon, that he had a firearm in his\\n\\npossession, and that there was a warrant for him from Indiana. Deputy Reece retrieved\\n\\na firearm from Murray’s waistband, secured the firearm in his patrol vehicle, and\\n\\nrequested that Caldwell exit the vehicle, which all occurred within five minutes of the\\n\\ntraffic stop. At roughly five minutes into the traffic stop, Deputy Reece went to his\\n\\nvehicle and provided dispatch with Murray’s and Caldwell’s driver’s licenses and the\\n\\nserial number for the firearm, and he entered information into a computer for roughly\\n\\nfive minutes. Approximately 11 minutes after the beginning of the traffic stop, Deputy\\n\\nReece searched the vehicle and recovered a firearm and Xanax pills from Caldwell’s\\n\\npurse. The video footage shows that the search of Caldwell’s purse occurred before\\n\\ndispatch provided a response to Deputy Reece with information regarding Murray and\\n\\nCaldwell.\\n\\n      Caldwell was indicted on one count of possession of a firearm during the\\n\\ncommission of a felony (OCGA § 16-11-106) and one count of violation of the Georgia\\n\\nControlled Substances Act (OCGA § 16-13-30 (a)).1 Caldwell filed a motion to\\n\\nsuppress, arguing that Deputy Reece abandoned the purpose of the investigation and\\n\\n      1\\n        Murray was charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted\\nfelon (OCGA § 16-11-131 (b)) in the same indictment.\\n                                          4\\n impermissibly prolonged the traffic stop, and thus the search of the vehicle and the\\n\\nitems obtained were the result of an unlawful detention. Caldwell further argued that\\n\\nDeputy Reece lacked probable cause to search her purse and that Murray’s consent\\n\\nto a search of the vehicle did not authorize a search of her purse. In response, the State\\n\\ncontended that Deputy Reece did not unlawfully prolong the traffic stop, the consent\\n\\nto search the vehicle extended to all of the containers in the vehicle including\\n\\nCaldwell’s purse, and the presence of the marijuana roach gave Deputy Reece\\n\\nprobable cause to search the vehicle and its contents. The trial court granted\\n\\nCaldwell’s motion to suppress after a hearing, determining that (1) Caldwell did not\\n\\nconsent to the search of her purse, to which she had “unequivocal ownership”\\n\\nindependent from Murray; (2) although Murray gave Deputy Reece marijuana from\\n\\ninside the vehicle, “which may have enabled [him]” to extend the stop as to Murray,\\n\\nDeputy Reece impermissibly extended the traffic stop as to Caldwell; and (3) the\\n\\nconsent to search the vehicle was invalid because it was the product of an unlawful\\n\\ndetention. The State filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court\\n\\nsummarily denied after another hearing. This appeal followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            5\\n       1. The State argues, among other things, that the trial court erred by\\n\\ndetermining that Caldwell’s detention was unlawful.2 We conclude that the trial court\\n\\ndid not err by determining that Deputy Reece unlawfully prolonged Caldwell’s\\n\\ndetention.\\n\\n      “[A] trial court’s conclusion that a traffic stop was unreasonably prolonged may\\n\\noften be a fact-intensive determination, but it is ultimately a holding of constitutional\\n\\nlaw that we review de novo.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.)

App. 195\\n, 201 (1) (\\n854 SE2d 366\\n) (2021).\\n\\n      “It is axiomatic that a police officer who observes a traffic violation is\\n\\nauthorized to conduct a traffic stop of the vehicle in question.” (Citation omitted.)\\n\\nRush v. State, \\n368 Ga. App. 827\\n, 831 (2) (\\n890 SE2d 883\\n) (2023). “Moreover, when\\n\\npolice make a traffic stop, as a practical matter, not only the driver of the stopped\\n\\nvehicle but also any passengers are detained during the stop and are considered\\n\\n‘seized’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.” State v. Williams, \\n264 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 199\\n, 201 (\\n590 SE2d 151\\n) (2003). “Once a valid traffic stop has been effected, the\\n\\nFourth Amendment prohibits the officer from unreasonably prolonging the stop\\n\\n      2\\n        We address the State’s enumerations of error in a different order than what\\nis presented in its brief.\\n                                           6\\n beyond the time required to fulfill the purpose of the stop without a reasonable\\n\\narticulable suspicion of other illegal activity.” (Citation omitted.) Rush, supra, 368 Ga.\\n\\nApp. at 831-832 (1). And “[t]he United States Supreme Court has held unequivocally\\n\\nthat the Fourth Amendment does not allow even a de minimis extension of a traffic\\n\\nstop beyond the investigation of the circumstances giving rise to the stop.” (Citations\\n\\nomitted.) Hill v. State, \\n360 Ga. App. 683\\n, 686 (1) (\\n859 SE2d 891\\n) (2021). Therefore,\\n\\n      activities unrelated to the mission of the traffic stop must not extend the\\n      time of the stop at all, and such a prolongation of the stop is not\\n      permissible even if those activities are done in the middle of the stop.\\n      Thus, if an officer clearly diverts from conducting his traffic\\n      investigation to carry out a task unrelated to the mission of the stop, the\\n      traffic stop is unreasonably prolonged.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) McNeil v. State, \\n362 Ga. App. 85\\n, 89 (\\n866 SE2d\\n\\n249\\n) (2021).\\n\\n      In light of the aforementioned principles, we conclude that Deputy Reece\\n\\nclearly diverted from the traffic investigation, which resulted in Caldwell’s illegal\\n\\ndetention. As recounted above, almost immediately after initiating a traffic stop on\\n\\nMurray’s vehicle for Murray’s seatbelt violation and obtaining Murray’s and\\n\\nCaldwell’s driver’s licenses, Deputy Reece asked Murray whether marijuana was legal\\n\\n                                            7\\n in Indiana, whether Murray had “anything in the car,” and for consent to search the\\n\\nvehicle. Deputy Reece then questioned Murray about his “pot” sunglasses, when he\\n\\nhad last “smoked weed,” and whether there was a marijuana “roach” in the car. At\\n\\nthis point, Deputy Reece had not even begun to write a citation for the seatbelt\\n\\nviolation nor did he run a check of the driver’s licenses.3 Moreover, Deputy Reece\\n\\nadmitted that he did not detect any odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle at any\\n\\ntime during the encounter, and there was no testimony that Deputy Reece otherwise\\n\\nobserved any contraband in the vehicle prior to the questioning. Thus it is clear that\\n\\nafter initiating the traffic stop for the seatbelt violation, Deputy Reece clearly diverted\\n\\nfrom his investigation of the traffic stop and instead pursued to question Murray about\\n\\nmarijuana, a matter entirely unrelated to the purpose of the traffic stop. Therefore, the\\n\\ntraffic stop was prolonged beyond the time necessary to fulfill the mission of issuing\\n\\na citation for the seatbelt violation. See McNeil, supra, 363 Ga. App. at 88-90 (police\\n\\noffice unlawfully prolonged traffic stop for following too closely where officer\\n\\nabandoned the task of writing a citation and instead questioned the defendant about\\n\\nher candle business); Nunnally v. State, \\n310 Ga. App. 183\\n, 186-187 (2) (\\n713 SE2d 408\\n)\\n\\n       3\\n        Although Deputy Reece later ran a check of the driver’s licenses, it is unclear\\nif he ever issued a citation for the seatbelt violation.\\n                                            8\\n (2011) (officer unreasonably prolonged traffic stop where he abandoned the\\n\\ninvestigation into a vehicle’s registration and detained the passengers of the vehicle\\n\\nto search for drugs). Compare Betancourt v. State, \\n322 Ga. App. 201\\n, 205 (2) (a) (\\n744\\n\\nSE2d 419\\n) (2013) (traffic stop for a dark window tint was not unreasonably prolonged\\n\\nwhere the search for drugs occurred while the purpose of the traffic stop was being\\n\\n“actively pursu[ed]”). Consequently, the trial court correctly determined that Deputy\\n\\nReece unlawfully prolonged Caldwell’s detention. and therefore it properly granted\\n\\nCaldwell’s motion to suppress.\\n\\n      2. The State further argues that the trial court erred by ruling that Caldwell did\\n\\nnot consent to a search of the vehicle, law enforcement lacked probable cause to\\n\\nsearch the vehicle, Murray’s consent to search the vehicle did not include a search of\\n\\nCaldwell’s purse, Deputy Reece acted improperly by requesting identification, and\\n\\nDeputy Reece unlawfully asked Murray and Caldwell to exit the vehicle. In light of our\\n\\nholding in Division 1, it is unnecessary to address these claims of error.\\n\\n      Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court’s order granting\\n\\nCaldwell’s motion to suppress.\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed. Land, J., concurs. Markle, J., dissents.\\n\\n\\n                                           9\\n  A24A0037. THE STATE v. CALDWELL.\\n\\n      MARKLE, Judge, dissenting.\\n\\n      The majority concludes that the officer conducting the stop unreasonably\\n\\nprolonged the detention, and thus any evidence found must be suppressed. Although\\n\\nI believe this is a close case, I would nevertheless reach the opposite conclusion.\\n\\nTherefore, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n      The entire exchange — from the time the officer initiated the stop and asked\\n\\nfor identification until the driver informed the officer he had an outstanding warrant\\n\\n— lasted less then three minutes. As the United States Supreme Court has explained,\\n\\n“[a]n officer’s inquires into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop\\n\\n. . . do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long\\n\\nas those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.” Arizona v.\\n\\nJohnson, \\n555 U.S. 323\\n, 333 (II) (B) (129 SCt 781, 172 LE2d 694) (2009) (emphasis\\n\\nadded). Rather, “the question is whether the detention was appreciably prolonged,\\n\\nconsidering the detention as a whole, and keeping in mind that the touchstone of our\\n\\ninquiry is reasonableness.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Rodriguez v. State, \\n295\\n\\nGa. 362\\n, 369-370 (2) (b) (\\n761 SE2d 19\\n) (2014).\\n       As we have explained,\\n\\n      a reasonable time to conduct a traffic stop includes the time necessary for\\n      the officer to run a computer check on the validity of the driver's license\\n      and registration, and to check for outstanding warrants and/or criminal\\n      histories on the driver and other occupants. The law further allows the\\n      officer to question the vehicle’s driver and/or its occupants during the\\n      course of the stop, and even to lawfully ask questions unrelated to the\\n      purpose of a valid traffic stop, so long as the questioning does not\\n      unreasonably prolong the detention.\\n\\n\\n(Citation omitted; emphasis supplied.)

Based on the brief\\n\\nnature of the stop, during which the officer was authorized to check the occupants’\\n\\nidentification and ask questions, I would not conclude the detention was unreasonable.\\n\\nTherefore, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          2\\n \"),\n",

SMITH et al. v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        COLVIN, Justice.\\n\\n        This is an appeal from an in rem civil-asset-forfeiture\\n\\nproceeding against over $1 million held in various bank accounts,\\n\\nreal property, and other property that the State alleges was used,\\n\\nintended for use, or constituted the proceeds derived from the\\n\\ncommission of numerous crimes related to the theft, purchase, and\\n\\nsale of catalytic converters and other regulated metal property.\\n\\nAppellants Garrett Smith, Stacey Smith, SmithCo Recycling, LLC\\n\\n(“SmithCo Recycling”), and SmithCo Transfer, LLC (“SmithCo\\n\\nTransfer”) answered the State’s forfeiture complaint, claiming to be\\n\\nthe owners of the seized property, and moved to dismiss the\\n\\ncomplaint. In their motion to dismiss, Appellants argued that the\\n\\ntrial court had failed to timely hold a bench trial or order a\\n continuance, in violation of OCGA § 9-16-12 (f), which provides that,\\n\\n“[i]f an answer is filed, a bench trial shall be held within 60 days\\n\\nafter the last claimant was served with the complaint; provided,\\n\\nhowever, that such trial may be continued by the court for good\\n\\ncause shown.” And Appellants also argued that the State had failed\\n\\nto allege the essential elements of a crime, in violation of OCGA § 9-\\n\\n16-12 (a), which provides that an in rem civil-asset-forfeiture\\n\\n“complaint shall . . . allege the essential elements of the criminal\\n\\nviolation which is claimed to exist.” The trial court denied the motion\\n\\nto dismiss, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. See Smith v. State,\\n\\n366 Ga. App. 815 (884 SE2d 403) (2023).\\n\\n     We then granted certiorari to address three questions. 1 First,\\n\\nwe asked whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that OCGA\\n\\n§ 9-16-12 (f)’s 60-day time period for holding a bench trial or\\n\\ncontinuing the trial for good cause in an in rem civil-asset-forfeiture\\n\\ncase began to run when the last claimant, who was never served,\\n\\n\\n     1 We granted certiorari on September 19, 2023. The case was docketed to\\n\\nthis Court’s term beginning in December 2023 and was orally argued on\\nJanuary 9, 2024.\\n                                    2\\n filed an answer without raising the defense of insufficient service.\\n\\nSecond, we asked if the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the\\n\\nintent element of theft by taking could be inferred from the\\n\\nallegations of the second amended complaint, and thus that the\\n\\nsecond amended complaint satisfied OCGA § 9-16-12 (a)’s\\n\\nrequirement that the complaint allege the essential elements of the\\n\\noffense. Finally, we asked if the second amended complaint alleged\\n\\nthe essential elements of at least one criminal violation, assuming\\n\\nthat it did not adequately allege the essential elements of theft by\\n\\ntaking.\\n\\n     As explained below, we conclude that, based on statements\\n\\nAppellants made in the trial court, Appellants are estopped from\\n\\narguing on appeal that the date SmithCo Transfer filed its answer\\n\\nwas not equivalent to the date it was served with the complaint. On\\n\\nthat basis, we affirm the trial court’s denial of Appellants’ motion to\\n\\ndismiss the complaint for failure to timely hold a bench trial or\\n\\ncontinue the trial under OCGA § 9-16-12 (f). And we vacate the\\n\\nportion of the Court of Appeals’ opinion affirming the trial court’s\\n\\n                                  3\\n timeliness ruling without expressing any opinion on the merits of\\n\\nthe Court of Appeals’ analysis or on the first certiorari question.\\n\\n     As further explained below, we hold that the trial court and the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals erred in holding that the second amended\\n\\ncomplaint adequately alleged the essential elements of theft by\\n\\ntaking, as required by OCGA § 9-16-12 (a). We therefore reverse the\\n\\nportion of the Court of Appeals’ opinion holding otherwise. And\\n\\nbecause neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals addressed\\n\\nin the first instance whether the second amended complaint\\n\\nadequately alleged the essential elements of any other offense that\\n\\nmight support in rem civil forfeiture, we remand the case for further\\n\\nproceedings without answering the third certiorari question.2\\n\\n     1.   On December 3, 2021, the State filed an in rem civil-asset-\\n\\nforfeiture complaint against the property at issue in this case, which\\n\\nwas seized from, among other locations, SmithCo Recycling’s\\n\\nbusiness address. The complaint named as potential claimants\\n\\n\\n\\n     2 We thank the Institute for Justice and the Georgia Amusement &\\nMusic Operators Association for their amicus curiae briefs.\\n                                  4\\n Garrett Smith, Stacey Smith, and SmithCo Recycling. And those\\n\\npotential claimants were served on December 6, 2021.\\n\\n     The Smiths and SmithCo Recycling answered the complaint on\\n\\nDecember 31, 2021, and their answer identified SmithCo Transfer\\n\\nas the owner of some of the property claimed to be subject to\\n\\nforfeiture. On January 13, 2022, the State filed a motion to join\\n\\nSmithCo Transfer as a necessary party. SmithCo Transfer then filed\\n\\nan answer to the complaint on January 21, 2022. And on January\\n\\n24, 2022, the trial court signed an order granting the motion to join\\n\\nSmithCo Transfer, which was filed two days later.\\n\\n     On January 24 and 25, 2022, the parties and the assigned trial\\n\\njudge corresponded via email about possible trial dates in early\\n\\nFebruary 2022. But it is unclear from the record whether the trial\\n\\ncourt set a date for a bench trial. And on January 31, 2022, the case\\n\\nwas reassigned to another trial judge.\\n\\n     At a hearing before the new trial judge on February 10, 2022,\\n\\nthe court stated that it was going to continue the trial for good cause\\n\\nuntil March 9 through 11, 2022. Appellants did not object to the\\n\\n                                  5\\n continuance.\\n\\n     On February 18, 2022, the State filed a second amended\\n\\ncomplaint. In the second amended complaint, the State alleged that\\n\\nSmithCo Recycling and SmithCo Transfer were companies\\n\\nconducting business in Georgia, and that Garrett Smith and Stacey\\n\\nSmith were involved in the day-to-day business and operations of\\n\\nboth companies as co-owners, registered agents, or managing\\n\\nmembers. The State further alleged that, on various occasions,\\n\\nSmithCo Recycling, through its owners or agents, purchased\\n\\ncatalytic converters or other regulated metals that they “knew or\\n\\nshould have known were stolen”; that Garrett Smith enlisted third\\n\\nparties to purchase scrap vehicles or stolen catalytic converters for\\n\\nresale to SmithCo Recycling; that a SmithCo Recycling employee\\n\\nstole roll-off containers and sold them to SmithCo Recycling; that\\n\\npurchase transactions were completed “without the requisite\\n\\ndocumentation”; and that SmithCo Recycling failed to report certain\\n\\npurchase transactions to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation\\n\\n(“GBI”). Based on different combinations of these allegations, the\\n\\n                                 6\\n State alleged violations of numerous statutes, including OCGA § 10-\\n\\n1-351 (regulating the purchase of coils, copper wire, and catalytic\\n\\nconverters), OCGA § 10-1-353 (requiring secondary metals recyclers\\n\\nto maintain records of purchase transactions), OCGA § 10-1-359.1\\n\\n(requiring registration of secondary metals recyclers), OCGA § 10-1-\\n\\n359.5 (requiring secondary metals recyclers to provide purchase-\\n\\ntransaction information to the GBI), OCGA § 40-3-36 (regulating the\\n\\ndisposal of vehicles), OCGA § 16-4-8 (conspiracy to commit a crime),\\n\\nOCGA § 16-8-2 (theft by taking), OCGA § 16-8-4 (theft by\\n\\nconversion), OCGA § 16-8-7 (theft by receiving stolen property),\\n\\nOCGA § 16-8-83 (chop shop offenses), and OCGA § 16-14-4\\n\\n(Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act offenses).\\n\\n     On February 28, 2022, Appellants filed a motion seeking\\n\\ndismissal of the second amended complaint or judgment on the\\n\\npleadings. As relevant here, Appellants argued that the trial court\\n\\nhad failed to timely hold a bench trial or order a continuance, as\\n\\nrequired by OCGA § 9-16-12 (f), and that the State had failed to\\n\\nallege the essential elements of a crime, as required by OCGA § 9-\\n\\n                                 7\\n 16-12 (a).\\n\\n     Following a hearing, the trial court denied Appellant’s motion\\n\\non March 7, 2022. The trial court rejected Appellant’s timeliness\\n\\nargument under OCGA § 9-16-12 (f) for two reasons. First, the trial\\n\\ncourt concluded that the 60-day period to hold a bench trial or\\n\\ncontinue the trial for good cause had not elapsed because, according\\n\\nto the trial court, the original trial judge had continued the bench\\n\\ntrial for good cause during the email exchange on January 24 and\\n\\n25, 2022, and the undersigned judge had further continued the trial\\n\\nfor good cause during the February 10, 2022 hearing. Second,\\n\\nreasoning that waiver by appearance is a substitute for service, the\\n\\ntrial court concluded that the 60-day period had not even begun to\\n\\nrun until SmithCo Transfer filed its answer on January 21, 2022.\\n\\n     The trial court also rejected Appellants’ argument that the\\n\\nsecond amended complaint failed to allege the essential elements of\\n\\na criminal violation supporting civil forfeiture, as required by OCGA\\n\\n§ 9-16-12 (a). The court concluded that the second amended\\n\\ncomplaint satisfied that pleading requirement because the State had\\n\\n                                 8\\n alleged that law enforcement officers “seized the properties and\\n\\nlarge quantities of regulated metal pursuant to the law enforcement\\n\\ninvestigation of theft by taking and theft by receiving stolen\\n\\nproperty.”\\n\\n     On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed these rulings. See\\n\\nSmith, 366 Ga. App. at 817-820 (2)-(3). The Court of Appeals rejected\\n\\nAppellants’ argument that the case should have been dismissed\\n\\nunder OCGA § 9-16-12 (f), concluding that the 60-day time period\\n\\ndid not run from the date that Garrett Smith, Stacey Smith, and\\n\\nSmithCo Recycling were served with the original complaint, as\\n\\nAppellants argued, but rather from the date that SmithCo Transfer\\n\\nfiled an answer without having been served. See id. at 819 (3). The\\n\\ncourt reasoned that, “[b]ecause SmithCo Transfer filed an answer\\n\\nwithout raising the defense of insufficient service, the time SmithCo\\n\\nTransfer’s answer was filed is the equivalent of the time the last\\n\\nclaimant was served.” Id.\\n\\n     The Court of Appeals also rejected Appellants’ contention that\\n\\nthe second amended complaint did not satisfy OCGA § 9-16-12 (a)’s\\n\\n                                 9\\n pleading requirement that an in rem civil-asset-forfeiture complaint\\n\\nallege the essential elements of a criminal violation. See Smith, 366\\n\\nGa. App. at 817 (2). The court stated that the complaint alleged\\n\\nnumerous violations of theft by taking, charging that SmithCo\\n\\nRecycling and Garrett Smith enlisted an individual to steal catalytic\\n\\nconverters, that a SmithCo Recycling employee stole roll-off\\n\\ncontainers, and that SmithCo Recycling purchased the stolen\\n\\ncatalytic converters and roll-off containers, which it “knew or should\\n\\nhave known . . . were stolen.” Id. at 817-818 (2). The court further\\n\\nnoted that the essential elements of theft by taking were “(1) an\\n\\nunlawful taking of the property of another (2) with the intent of\\n\\ndepriving him of it.” Id. at 817 (2) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\nAnd although the Court of Appeals acknowledged that “the second\\n\\namended complaint [did] not explicitly allege that the catalytic\\n\\nconverters or the roll-off containers were taken with the intent to\\n\\ndeprive the rightful owners of the property,” the court nevertheless\\n\\nconcluded that the second amended complaint adequately alleged\\n\\nthe essential elements of theft by taking because “the requisite\\n\\n                                  10\\n intent can be inferred from the allegations of the complaint.” Id. at\\n\\n817-818 (2). We granted certiorari to address these rulings.\\n\\n     2.   The first certiorari question concerns the determinations\\n\\nof the trial court and Court of Appeals that OCGA § 9-16-12 (f) did\\n\\nnot require dismissal of the second amended complaint. As noted\\n\\nabove, OCGA § 9-16-12 (f) provides that “[i]f an answer is filed, a\\n\\nbench trial shall be held within 60 days after the last claimant was\\n\\nserved with the complaint,” unless the trial is “continued by the\\n\\ncourt for good cause shown.” Here, the dispute turns on whether\\n\\nOCGA § 9-16-12 (f)’s 60-day period ran from December 6, 2021, the\\n\\ndate that the Smiths and SmithCo Recycling were served, or\\n\\nJanuary 21, 2022, the date that SmithCo Transfer filed an answer\\n\\nwithout being served and without raising insufficiency of service as\\n\\na defense. Based on these dates, the deadline to hold a bench trial\\n\\nor order a continuance was either February 4, 2022, or March 22,\\n\\n2022. And it is undisputed on appeal that the trial court granted a\\n\\ncontinuance for good cause on February 10, 2022. Thus, assuming\\n\\nwithout deciding that the trial court erred in concluding that the\\n\\n                                 11\\n formerly assigned trial-court judge had granted a continuance\\n\\nduring the email exchange on January 24 and 25, 2022, OCGA § 9-\\n\\n16-12 (f) would mandate dismissal of the second amended complaint\\n\\nif the 60-day period ran from the date that the Smiths and SmithCo\\n\\nRecycling were served but not if the 60-day period ran from the date\\n\\nthat SmithCo Transfer filed an answer.\\n\\n     Although our first certiorari question asked whether the Court\\n\\nof Appeals erred as a matter of law in equating the date that “the\\n\\nlast claimant was served with the complaint” under OCGA § 9-16-\\n\\n12 (f) with the date that the last claimant filed an answer without\\n\\nraising a defense of insufficient service, we do not reach the merits\\n\\nof that determination. This is because, as explained below, we\\n\\nconclude that Appellants were estopped from arguing that the date\\n\\nSmithCo Transfer filed its answer should not be treated as the date\\n\\nSmithCo Transfer was served, after Appellants took the opposite\\n\\nposition with respect to another issue in the trial court.\\n\\n     Judicial estoppel, which “is an equitable doctrine that can be\\n\\ninvoked by a court at its discretion,” Fulton County. v. Ward-Poag,\\n\\n                                  12\\n 310 Ga. 289, 291 (2) (a) (849 SE2d 465) (2020), “prevents a party\\n\\nfrom asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with\\n\\na claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding,” IBF\\n\\nParticipating Income Fund v.

See\\n\\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 668 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “judicial\\n\\nestoppel” as “[e]stoppel that prevents a party from contradicting\\n\\nprevious declarations made during the same or an earlier proceeding\\n\\nif the change in position would adversely affect the proceeding or\\n\\nconstitute a fraud on the court”). “The purpose of judicial estoppel is\\n\\nto protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties\\n\\nfrom deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of\\n\\nthe moment.” Ward-Poag, 310 Ga. at 292 (2) (b) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). See Sherman v. City of Atlanta, 293 Ga. 169,\\n\\n175 (4) (744 SE2d 689) (2013) (noting that “judicial estoppel . . . is\\n\\ndesigned to protect the integrity of the judicial process by\\n\\nprohibiting parties from playing ‘fast and loose’ with the courts”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n                                  13\\n      “[T]hree factors generally inform a decision about whether to\\n\\napply the doctrine [of judicial estoppel] in a particular case.” Ward-\\n\\nPoag, 310 Ga. at 294 (2) (b) (citing New Hampshire v. Maine, 532\\n\\nU.S. 742, 750-751 (II) (121 SCt 1808, 149 LE2d 968) (2001)). Those\\n\\nfactors are whether (1) “a party’s later position [is] ‘clearly\\n\\ninconsistent’ with its earlier position,” (2) “the party has succeeded\\n\\nin persuading a court to accept that party’s earlier position,” and (3)\\n\\n“the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an\\n\\nunfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing\\n\\nparty if not estopped.” Id. at 293-294 (2) (b) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). But although these three factors are often\\n\\ninstructive, they do not “establish inflexible prerequisites or an\\n\\nexhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial\\n\\nestoppel.” Id. at 294 (2) (b) (citation and punctuation omitted). This\\n\\nis because “the circumstances under which judicial estoppel may\\n\\nappropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general\\n\\nformulation of principle.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, we conclude that Appellants are judicially estopped from\\n\\n                                  14\\n challenging the conclusion reached by the trial court and the Court\\n\\nof Appeals that SmithCo Transfer was effectively served on the date\\n\\nthat it filed its answer because, during an e-mail exchange on\\n\\nJanuary 24 and 25, 2022, Appellants strategically argued that the\\n\\ntrial court and the State should reach just that conclusion in an\\n\\neffort to expedite the proceedings. The e-mail exchange shows that\\n\\nthe trial court e-mailed counsel to inform them that the court had\\n\\nsigned an order adding SmithCo Transfer as a party, that SmithCo\\n\\nTransfer had not yet been served, and that the court was required\\n\\nto hold a bench trial within 60 days after the last claimant was\\n\\nserved absent a continuance for good cause. The court stated, “I am\\n\\nprepared to bench trial this case on February 1, 2022, and notice the\\n\\nattorneys, unless the attorneys advise me differently or show good\\n\\ncause.” Appellants’ counsel responded that Appellants were “ready\\n\\nto proceed on 2/1.” But the State said that it “anticipate[d] filing a\\n\\ngood cause motion for continuance to allow time for service on\\n\\nSmithCo Transfer[ ].” In response, Appellants’ counsel wrote,\\n\\n“Judge: SmithCo Transfer, LLC filed a verified answer on Friday. It\\n\\n                                 15\\n was accepted yesterday. Effectively, SmithCo Transfer, LLC has\\n\\nacknowledged service and is ready to proceed also.” In subsequent\\n\\nemails, the parties and the court discussed the possibility of\\n\\nalternative trial dates on February 9 or 10, 2022. And the State\\n\\nneither moved for a continuance nor served SmithCo Transfer.\\n\\n     From this email exchange, it is clear that the parties and the\\n\\ncourt understood OCGA § 9-16-12 (f) to require the court to hold a\\n\\nbench trial or grant a continuance for good cause by early February\\n\\n2022 based on the service date of the Smiths and SmithCo Recycling,\\n\\nand that the State intended to move for a continuance in order to\\n\\nserve SmithCo Transfer. In this context, Appellants’ response that\\n\\nSmithCo Transfer had “[e]ffectively . . . acknowledged service” by\\n\\n“fil[ing] a verified answer on Friday” evidences an intentional,\\n\\nstrategic decision to persuade the trial court and the State that\\n\\nSmithCo Transfer did not need to be served, and that the court\\n\\nshould therefore deny any forthcoming motion for a continuance,\\n\\nbecause SmithCo Transfer had functionally been served on January\\n\\n21, 2022, the date that it filed its answer. In other words, Appellants\\n\\n                                  16\\n attempted to undermine the State’s grounds for a continuance and\\n\\ntherefore avoid delay by arguing that the court and the State should\\n\\ntreat SmithCo Transfer’s answer as a substitute for service.\\n\\n     Turning to the judicial-estoppel factors, Appellants’ argument\\n\\nin the e-mail exchange is “clearly inconsistent” with the position\\n\\nthey have taken on appeal. Ward-Poag, 310 Ga. at 293-294 (2) (b)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). As explained above, Appellants\\n\\nargued in the e-mail exchange that the court should treat SmithCo\\n\\nTransfer’s answer as a substitute for service because the answer\\n\\n“[e]ffectively . . . acknowledged service.” Cf. Kennedy v. Porter, 213\\n\\nGa. App. 398, 399 (444 SE2d 818) (1994) (holding that the defendant\\n\\nwas timely served within the limitations period based on the date\\n\\nthat the defendant’s attorney acknowledged service). But Appellants\\n\\nthen “deliberately chang[ed] [their] position[ ],” Ward-Poag, 310 Ga.\\n\\nat 292 (2) (b) (citation and punctuation omitted), when challenging\\n\\nthe trial court’s conclusion that, because SmithCo Transfer’s answer\\n\\nwas “in effect a substitute for service,” OCGA § 9-16-12 (f)’s 60-day\\n\\ntime period to hold a bench trial “began to run . . . at the time that\\n\\n                                 17\\n the last claimant, SmithCo Transfer, LLC, filed its answer on\\n\\nJanuary 21, 2022.” See Reynaud v. Five Oaks Dev., Inc., 359 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 606, 609 (1) (859 SE2d 570) (Ga. Ct. App. 2021) (“The essential\\n\\nfunction and justification of judicial estoppel is to prevent the use of\\n\\nintentional self-contradiction as a means of obtaining unfair\\n\\nadvantage in a forum provided for suitors seeking justice.” (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     Whether Appellants “succeeded in persuading [the trial] court\\n\\nto accept [Appellants’] earlier position” that SmithCo Transfer’s\\n\\nanswer was a substitute for service is a closer call. Ward-Poag, 310\\n\\nGa. at 293-294 (2) (b) (citation and punctuation omitted). This is for\\n\\ntwo reasons. First, it appears from the record that Appellants’\\n\\nrepresentation that SmithCo Transfer’s answer was the functional\\n\\nequivalent of service persuaded the State to abandon its stated\\n\\nintention to move for a continuance to serve SmithCo Transfer, and\\n\\nthus, the trial court was never called upon to decide whether a\\n\\ncontinuance was necessary to effect actual service on SmithCo\\n\\nTransfer. Second, the trial court’s OCGA § 9-16-12 (f) analysis did\\n\\n                                  18\\n not expressly rely on Appellants’ representation that SmithCo\\n\\nTransfer’s answer date was equivalent to its service date, although\\n\\nthe trial court quoted the relevant language from the e-mail\\n\\nexchange in the section of its order addressing OCGA § 9-16-12 (f)\\n\\nand reached a conclusion consistent with that representation.\\n\\n     By contrast, the third factor — “whether the party seeking to\\n\\nassert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or\\n\\nimpose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped,”\\n\\nWard-Poag, 310 Ga. at 293-294 (2) (b) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted) — is clearly present here. Appellants argue on appeal that\\n\\nOCGA § 9-16-12 (f)’s 60-day time period to hold a bench trial or\\n\\nobtain a continuance must have run from the date that the Smiths\\n\\nand SmithCo Recycling were served because they were “the only\\n\\nparties served,” and that the deadline expired on February 4, 2022,\\n\\nbecause “the State never filed a motion [for a continuance] asking\\n\\nthat the . . . deadline be moved for ‘good cause.’” But as noted above,\\n\\nthe record indicates that the reason the Smiths and SmithCo\\n\\nRecycling were “the only parties served” and that the State did not\\n\\n                                  19\\n file a motion for a continuance was because, after the State said it\\n\\nintended to seek a continuance to serve SmithCo Recycling,\\n\\nAppellants represented to the court and to the State that SmithCo\\n\\nRecycling had been effectively served on the date it answered the\\n\\ncomplaint and therefore did not need to receive actual service.\\n\\n     In sum, the record shows that Appellants made a strategic\\n\\ndecision to argue that SmithCo Transfer’s answer was a substitute\\n\\nfor service in order to forestall an anticipated motion for a\\n\\ncontinuance. But then Appellants opportunistically took the\\n\\nopposite position when challenging the trial court’s denial of its\\n\\nmotion to dismiss the case for failure to timely hold a bench trial or\\n\\ngrant a continuance under OCGA § 9-16-12 (f). And because the facts\\n\\nand circumstances of this case make it apparent that Appellants’\\n\\nearlier position contributed to the State’s decision not to seek a\\n\\ncontinuance or to serve SmithCo Transfer, allowing Appellants to\\n\\nmaintain an inconsistent position on appeal would unfairly benefit\\n\\nAppellants to the State’s detriment. Finally, while the court’s\\n\\nacceptance of Appellants’ earlier position is not clearly established,\\n\\n                                 20\\n that does not defeat application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel\\n\\nbecause no single factor is an “inflexible prerequisite[ ]” that must\\n\\nbe satisfied before applying the doctrine. Ward-Poag, 310 Ga. at 294\\n\\n(2) (b) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Considering all of the circumstances, we conclude that\\n\\nAppellants are estopped from arguing that the trial court or Court\\n\\nof Appeals erred in equating the date that SmithCo Transfer\\n\\nanswered the complaint with the date that SmithCo Transfer was\\n\\nserved. And as a result, Appellants cannot challenge the conclusion\\n\\nthat OCGA § 9-16-12 (f)’s 60-day time period to hold a bench trial or\\n\\nobtain a continuance, which runs from the date of service on the last\\n\\nclaimant, ran from the date that SmithCo Transfer answered the\\n\\ncomplaint. In light of our conclusion, we vacate Division 3 of the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals’ decision without expressing any opinion on\\n\\nwhether the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted OCGA § 9-16-12\\n\\n(f) in equating, as a matter of law, the date that “the last claimant\\n\\nwas served” with the date that the last claimant filed an answer\\n\\nwithout raising a defense of insufficient service. See Smith, 366 Ga.\\n\\n                                 21\\n App. at 819-820 (3).\\n\\n     3.    In the second certiorari question, we asked if the Court of\\n\\nAppeals erred in holding that, because the intent element of theft by\\n\\ntaking could be inferred from the allegations of the second amended\\n\\ncomplaint, the second amended complaint satisfied OCGA § 9-16-12\\n\\n(a)’s requirement that the complaint allege the essential elements of\\n\\nthe offense. As explained below, we conclude that the Court of\\n\\nAppeals erred in concluding that the State adequately alleged theft\\n\\nby taking because the standard for assessing whether an in rem civil\\n\\nforfeiture complaint adequately alleges the essential elements of a\\n\\ncriminal violation under OCGA § 9-16-12 (a) is the same as the\\n\\nstandard for assessing whether criminal charges in an indictment\\n\\ncan survive a general demurrer, and the State’s allegations\\n\\nregarding theft by taking fall short of that standard.\\n\\n     (a)   The Uniform Civil Forfeiture Procedure Act sets out the\\n\\npleading requirements for an in rem civil-asset-forfeiture complaint\\n\\nin OCGA § 9-16-12 (a). As relevant here, that provision states that\\n\\nan in rem civil-asset-forfeiture “complaint shall . . . allege the\\n\\n                                  22\\n essential elements of the criminal violation which is claimed to\\n\\nexist.” OCGA § 9-16-12 (a).\\n\\n     To determine whether the Court of Appeals correctly\\n\\ninterpreted and applied this provision, we must “examine the\\n\\nstatute’s plain language” and read that text “in its most natural and\\n\\nreasonable way, as an ordinary speaker of the English language\\n\\nwould.” Ford Motor Co. v. Cosper, 317 Ga. 356, 359 (2) (893 SE2d\\n\\n106) (2023) (citations and punctuation omitted). In doing so, we\\n\\n“presum[e] that the General Assembly meant what it said and said\\n\\nwhat it meant,” and we “view[ ] the statutory text in the context in\\n\\nwhich it appears.” Id. (citations and punctuation omitted). “For\\n\\ncontext, we may look to other provisions of the same statute, the\\n\\nstructure and history of the whole statute, and the other law —\\n\\nconstitutional, statutory, and common law alike — that forms the\\n\\nlegal background of the statutory provision in question.” Id. (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     We begin our construction of OCGA § 9-16-12 (a) by noting that\\n\\nthe provision, which was enacted in 2015, see Ga. L. 2015, pp. 693,\\n\\n                                  23\\n 702, 753 §§ 1-1, 4-1 (effective July 1, 2015), was modeled on a\\n\\nstatutory precursor in the Criminal Code. That statutory precursor\\n\\nprovided that an in rem forfeiture complaint must “allege the\\n\\nessential elements of the violation which is claimed to exist.” Former\\n\\nOCGA § 16-13-49 (o) (1) (effective through June 30, 2015). The only\\n\\ndifference between this language and the language of OCGA § 9-16-\\n\\n12 (a) is that the latter provision specifies that it is the essential\\n\\nelements of a “criminal” violation that the State must allege. And\\n\\nthe inclusion of the word “criminal” suggests that, while a forfeiture\\n\\ncomplaint under OCGA § 9-16-12 (a) is civil in nature, criminal law\\n\\ncontinues to provide relevant context for interpreting the meaning\\n\\nof the provision.\\n\\n     In the criminal context, alleging the essential elements of a\\n\\ncriminal offense has long been understood as a requirement for\\n\\ncreating a legally sufficient indictment that can survive a general\\n\\ndemurrer or motion in arrest of judgment. See, e.g., Stegar v. State,\\n\\n39 Ga. 583, 586 (1869) (holding that, because the indictment failed\\n\\nto allege robbery’s “necessary” element “that the money or property\\n\\n                                 24\\n was taken from the person of another,” the indictment was “fatally\\n\\ndefective and the judgment must be arrested” (emphasis in\\n\\noriginal)); Johnson v. State, 203 Ga. 147, 148 (1) (45 SE2d 616)\\n\\n(1947) (holding that the trial court properly denied a general\\n\\ndemurrer to an indictment because “[a]ll of the essential elements\\n\\nto constitute a violation of [the Criminal Code] section [were]\\n\\nalleged”); State v. Eubanks, 239 Ga. 483, 485-486 (238 SE2d 38)\\n\\n(1977) (noting that a general demurrer or motion in arrest of\\n\\njudgment “asserts that the indictment contains a defect on its face\\n\\naffecting the substance and real merits of the offense charged and\\n\\nvoiding the indictment, such as failure to charge a necessary\\n\\nelement of the crime”), superseded by statute on other grounds as\\n\\nnoted in Palmer v. State, 282 Ga. 466 (651 SE2d 86) (2007). This\\n\\nlongstanding requirement derives from the constitutional right to\\n\\ndue process. See Eubanks v. State, 317 Ga. 563, 582 (4) (894 SE2d\\n\\n27) (2023) (noting that, “[t]o satisfy due process, an indictment must\\n\\ncontain all the essential elements of the crime” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)); Jackson v.

Specifically, we have long held that\\n\\n     [t]o assess the merits of a general demurrer, . . . a court\\n     asks whether the defendant can admit each and every fact\\n     alleged in the indictment and still be innocent of any\\n\\n                                   26\\n      crime. If so, the general demurrer should be sustained.\\n     But if the admission of the facts alleged would lead\\n     necessarily to the conclusion that the accused is guilty of\\n     a crime, the indictment is sufficient to withstand a\\n     general demurrer.\\n\\nPowell v. State, Case No. S24A0239, 2024 WL 1862075, at *4, __ Ga.\\n\\n__, __ (2) (__ SE2d __) (2024) (citation and punctuation omitted;\\n\\nciting case law tracing back to Newman v.

State, 300 Ga. 500, 502 (2) (796 SE2d 708)\\n\\n(2017) (“The true test of the sufficiency of an indictment that will\\n\\nwithstand a general demurrer is as follows: If all the facts which the\\n\\nindictment charges can be admitted, and still the accused be\\n\\ninnocent, the indictment is bad; but if, taking the facts alleged as\\n\\npremises, the guilt of the accused follows as a legal conclusion, the\\n\\nindictment is good.” (punctuation omitted) (quoting Lowe v.

Stated differently, “to\\n\\nwithstand a general demurrer, an indictment must: (1) recite the\\n\\nlanguage of the statute that sets out all the elements of the offense\\n\\ncharged, or (2) allege the facts necessary to establish violation of a\\n\\ncriminal statute” because, “[i]f either of these requisites is met, then\\n\\n                                  27\\n the accused cannot admit the allegations of the indictment and yet\\n\\nbe not guilty of the crime charged.” Jackson, 301 Ga. at 141 (1). See\\n\\nPowell, Case No. S24A0239, 2024 WL 1862075, at *4, __ Ga. at __\\n\\n(2) (noting that we have framed the general-demurrer inquiry both\\n\\nways). See also Hames, 287 Ga. at 538-539 (3) (holding that an\\n\\nindictment failed to charge the defendant with the full mens rea\\n\\nnecessary to commit the charged crime because the indictment\\n\\n“omitted entirely any reference to [part of the] statutory [mens rea]\\n\\nrequirement,” and the facts alleged did not necessarily satisfy that\\n\\nmens rea requirement).\\n\\n     The legal and historical backdrop against which OCGA § 9-16-\\n\\n12 (a) was enacted therefore strongly suggests that the General\\n\\nAssembly adopted the standard for assessing the sufficiency of an\\n\\nindictment to withstand a general demurrer as the standard for\\n\\nassessing the sufficiency of an in rem civil-asset-forfeiture\\n\\ncomplaint. As explained above, OCGA § 9-16-12 (a)’s requirement\\n\\nthat the State “allege the essential elements of the criminal violation\\n\\nwhich is claimed to exist” not only mirrored a provision formerly in\\n\\n                                  28\\n the Criminal Code but also invoked language that the law\\n\\nrecognized as the standard for assessing the merits of a general\\n\\ndemurrer challenging the legal sufficiency of a criminal indictment.\\n\\n     The State challenges this conclusion, arguing that in rem\\n\\nforfeiture proceedings are civil in nature, and that civil forfeiture\\n\\npleadings are therefore governed by the Civil Practice Act’s notice-\\n\\npleading standard. See OCGA § 9-11-1 (providing that the Civil\\n\\nPractice Act “governs the procedure in all courts of record of this\\n\\nstate in all actions of a civil nature”). See also OCGA § 9-11-8 (a) (2)\\n\\n(A), (f) (providing that a complaint must contain “[a] short and plain\\n\\nstatement of the claims showing that the pleader is entitled to\\n\\nrelief,” and that “[a]ll pleadings shall be so construed as to do\\n\\nsubstantial justice”). But the primary provision of the Civil Practice\\n\\nAct on which the State relies shows why this argument is misguided.\\n\\nSpecifically, OCGA § 9-11-81 provides that the Civil Practice Act\\n\\n“shall apply to all special statutory proceedings except to the extent\\n\\nthat specific rules of practice and procedure in conflict herewith are\\n\\nexpressly prescribed by law.” (Emphasis supplied.) “It is well\\n\\n                                  29\\n established that the legislature may impose pleading requirements\\n\\nin special statutory proceedings in addition to those found in the\\n\\nCivil Practice Act[,] and in such cases, the sufficiency of a pleading\\n\\nmust be judged in light of the specific statutory requirements.” State\\n\\nv. Alford, 264 Ga. 243, 245 (2) (a) (444 SE2d 76) (1994). Here, the\\n\\nlegislature has provided special pleading standards for in rem civil-\\n\\nasset-forfeiture proceedings, requiring the State to “allege the\\n\\nessential elements of the criminal violation which is claimed to\\n\\nexist.” OCGA § 9-16-12 (a). As a result, the State’s argument that\\n\\nthe Civil Practice Act’s pleading standards for ordinary civil\\n\\ncomplaints govern the adequacy of in rem civil-asset-forfeiture\\n\\ncomplaints fails.\\n\\n     Accordingly, we hold that OCGA § 9-16-12 (a)’s requirement\\n\\nthat an in rem civil-asset-forfeiture complaint “allege the essential\\n\\nelements of the criminal violation which is claimed to exist” requires\\n\\nthe State to include allegations that could withstand a general\\n\\ndemurrer challenging the sufficiency of an indictment. And as\\n\\ndescribed above, that means the civil forfeiture complaint must, at\\n\\n                                 30\\n the very least, “recite the language of the statute that sets out all\\n\\nthe elements of the offense charged or allege the facts necessary to\\n\\nestablish [a] violation of a criminal statute,” such that a person\\n\\naccused in the complaint of committing a criminal violation could\\n\\nnot “admit the allegations of the [complaint] and yet be not guilty of\\n\\nthe crime charged.” State v. Mondor, 306 Ga. 338, 341 (1) (830 SE2d\\n\\n206) (2019) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     (b)   Having determined the appropriate standard for judging\\n\\nwhether an in rem civil-asset-forfeiture complaint “allege[s] the\\n\\nessential elements of the criminal violation which is claimed to\\n\\nexist,” OCGA § 9-16-12, we turn now to whether the Court of\\n\\nAppeals erred in holding that the second amended complaint\\n\\nsatisfied that requirement.\\n\\n     As relevant here, the second amended complaint sought\\n\\nforfeiture of the seized property under OCGA § 10-1-359.3. That\\n\\nstatute provides that “[a]ny property which is, directly or indirectly,\\n\\nused or intended for use in any manner to facilitate a crime and any\\n\\nproceeds derived or realized therefrom” are “contraband” and\\n\\n                                  31\\n “subject to forfeiture.” OCGA § 10-1-359.3 (b), (c). The statute\\n\\nfurther provides that the word “[c]rime” includes “[t]heft by taking\\n\\n. . . , theft by conversion . . . , or theft by receiving stolen property . . .\\n\\nif the subject of the theft was regulated metal property.” OCGA § 10-\\n\\n1-359.3 (a) (1) (A). “A person commits the offense of theft by taking\\n\\nwhen he unlawfully takes or, being in lawful possession thereof,\\n\\nunlawfully appropriates any property of another with the intention\\n\\nof depriving him of the property, regardless of the manner in which\\n\\nthe property is taken or appropriated.” OCGA § 16-8-2.\\n\\n      Here, the second amended complaint failed to allege the\\n\\nessential elements of theft by taking, as required by OCGA § 9-16-\\n\\n12 (a). The mens rea element of theft by taking — the intent to\\n\\ndeprive the rightful owner of his property — is an essential element\\n\\nof the offense that must be alleged. 3 See Mondor, 306 Ga. at 341 (1)\\n\\n(“To the extent that an indictment fails to allege all the essential\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 In its brief on appeal, the State concedes “that ‘intent’ is an essential\\n\\nelement of any crime, and that the intent to deprive the original owner of the\\nstolen property in question is an essential element of the offense of [t]heft by\\n[t]aking.”\\n                                       32\\n elements of the crime or crimes charged, including the required\\n\\nmens rea, it violates due process, is void, and cannot withstand a\\n\\ngeneral demurrer.” (citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis\\n\\nsupplied)). Accordingly, to satisfy OCGA § 9-16-12 (a)’s pleading\\n\\nstandard, the State was required to either “recite the language of\\n\\nthe statute that sets out” the intent-to-deprive element or “allege the\\n\\nfacts necessary to establish” that element. Id. (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     The Court of Appeals correctly noted that the second amended\\n\\ncomplaint failed to recite theft by taking’s statutory intent-to-\\n\\ndeprive element. See Smith, 366 Ga. App. at 818 (2) (noting that “the\\n\\nsecond amended complaint [did] not explicitly allege that the\\n\\ncatalytic converters or the roll-off containers were taken with the\\n\\nintent to deprive the rightful owners of the property”). But the Court\\n\\nof Appeals concluded that “the requisite intent c[ould] be inferred\\n\\nfrom the allegations of the complaint.” Id. In reaching this\\n\\nconclusion, the court did not specify which allegations in the\\n\\ncomplaint supported such an inference. And as explained below, we\\n\\n                                  33\\n conclude that the court erred to the extent that it concluded that the\\n\\nsecond amended complaint alleged facts necessarily establishing\\n\\ntheft by taking’s intent-to-deprive element.\\n\\n     The second amended complaint did not include counts but was\\n\\ninstead structured as a sequence of paragraphs, each of which\\n\\nincluded some allegations followed by citations to various statutes.\\n\\nIt is difficult to discern which allegations in the complaint pertain\\n\\nspecifically to theft by taking, as opposed to other alleged offenses.\\n\\nBut the theft-by-taking allegations appear to fall into four partly\\n\\noverlapping categories. First, the State alleged that a third party\\n\\nsold stolen catalytic converters to SmithCo Recycling or Garrett\\n\\nSmith. Second, the State alleged that SmithCo Recycling or Garrett\\n\\nSmith purchased stolen catalytic converters or other regulated\\n\\nmetals from third parties, including an employee of SmithCo\\n\\nRecycling, and that SmithCo Recycling or Garrett Smith knew or\\n\\nshould have known that the catalytic converters or other regulated\\n\\nmetals were stolen. Third, the State alleged that SmithCo Recycling\\n\\nor Garrett Smith enlisted third parties to purchase stolen catalytic\\n\\n                                 34\\n converters, which were then resold to SmithCo Recycling. Finally,\\n\\nthe State alleged that SmithCo Recycling or Garrett Smith enlisted\\n\\nthird parties to purchase stolen catalytic converters, which were\\n\\nthen resold to SmithCo Recycling, and that SmithCo Recycling knew\\n\\nor should have known that the catalytic converters were stolen.\\n\\n      While these allegations about the purchase and sale of\\n\\nproperty known to be stolen may create an air of criminality, they\\n\\nfail to allege any facts showing that any person unlawfully took\\n\\nanother’s property “with the intention of depriving him of the\\n\\nproperty.” OCGA § 16-8-2. The theft-by-taking allegations address\\n\\nonly what happened to the property after it was allegedly “stolen.”4\\n\\nBut even if the complaint had alleged that a person “stole” property\\n\\nin violation of OCGA § 16-8-2, such an allegation would be\\n\\ninsufficient to satisfy the pleading requirement, as it would\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 The State contends that the second amended complaint alleged that\\n\\nthird parties stole the regulated metals, not just that the property was stolen.\\nHowever, a review of the second amended complaint reveals that the State did\\nnot rely on such allegations to charge that the third parties violated OCGA\\n§ 16-8-2, only that the purchasers of the regulated metals violated OCGA § 16-\\n8-7 (a).\\n                                      35\\n necessarily rely on factual assumptions not set out in the complaint\\n\\nto establish an “intention [to] depriv[e]” the rightful owner of the\\n\\nproperty. OCGA § 16-8-2. See Jackson, 301 Ga. at 140-141 (1)-(2)\\n\\n(holding that it “is not enough” to “alleg[e] that a statute has been\\n\\nviolated,” and that an indictment was legally insufficient where it\\n\\nwas “based upon several assumptions of fact not set forth in the\\n\\nindictment”). And although the State argues that its allegations\\n\\nabout third parties subsequently selling the stolen property shows\\n\\nan “intention [to] depriv[e]” the rightful owner of the property, those\\n\\nallegations fail to establish that the third parties took the property\\n\\n“with” such an intention. OCGA § 16-8-2. See Brown v. State, 302\\n\\nGa. App. 641, 643 (1) (692 SE2d 9) (2010) (noting that, to establish\\n\\ntheft by taking, “[t]he evidence must show that the requisite intent\\n\\nto deprive the owner of the property was present at the time of the\\n\\ntaking” (emphasis supplied) (quoting Spray v. State, 223 Ga. App.\\n\\n154, 156 (1) (476 SE2d 878) (1996)).\\n\\n     To its credit, the State conceded at oral argument that, if the\\n\\nsecond amended complaint had instead been a criminal indictment,\\n\\n                                  36\\n its allegations could not have survived a general demurrer. And for\\n\\nthe reasons set out above, we agree that the second amended\\n\\ncomplaint failed to adequately allege theft by taking. Accordingly,\\n\\nwe reverse the Court of Appeals’ conclusion to the contrary.5\\n\\n      4.    Our final certiorari question asked whether the second\\n\\namended complaint adequately alleged the essential elements of any\\n\\ncriminal offense other than theft by taking. However, neither the\\n\\ntrial court nor the Court of Appeals addressed that issue, and we\\n\\ndecline to make such a determination in the first instance.\\n\\nAccordingly, as explained above, we reverse in part and vacate in\\n\\npart the Court of Appeals’ opinion. And we remand the case for\\n\\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n    Judgment reversed in part and vacated in part, and case\\nremanded. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n      5  We note that the trial court’s ruling fares no better. Rather than\\nconsidering whether the second amended complaint recited the statutory\\nelements of theft by taking or alleged facts establishing those elements, as it\\nwas required to do, the trial court simply concluded that the allegations of theft\\nby taking were sufficient because the complaint alleged that the property at\\nissue was seized “pursuant to [a] law enforcement investigation of theft by\\ntaking.” (Emphasis supplied.) Alleging the existence of a criminal investigation\\nis clearly insufficient to allege the essential elements of a criminal violation\\nunder the standard set out above.\\n                                       37\\n '),\n",

GRAY v. STATE\\n\\n\\n        MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n        LaVante Pierre Gray appeals from his convictions for felony\\n\\nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony in connection with the death of James Jones.1 As his sole\\n\\nenumeration on appeal, Gray asserts that the trial court erred by\\n\\nrefusing to give his request for jury charges supporting the defense\\n\\nof justification. Even assuming that the trial court erred, we\\n\\n\\n        1 Jones died on September 1, 2017, and Gray was indicted by a DeKalb\\n\\nCounty grand jury on January 4, 2018, on charges of malice murder (Count 1),\\nfelony murder (Count 2), aggravated assault (Count 3), and possession of a\\nfirearm during commission of a felony (Count 4). Gray was tried before a jury\\nin July 2021 and acquitted of Count 1 but found guilty of Counts 2, 3, and 4.\\nThe trial court sentenced Gray to serve life in prison on Count 2 and to serve\\nfive years in prison on Count 4, to run consecutively to Count 2. Count 3 was\\nmerged into Count 2 for sentencing. Gray filed a motion for new trial on July\\n30, 2021, which was amended by new counsel on March 15, 2023. The trial\\ncourt denied Gray’s motion as amended on June 29, 2023, and Gray timely filed\\na notice of appeal. This appeal was docketed to the April 2024 term of this\\nCourt and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n conclude that any error was harmless, so we affirm.\\n\\n      1. The evidence at trial showed the following. 2 On September\\n\\n1, 2017, Jones and Gray were sitting in Gray’s car in Jones’s uncle’s\\n\\ndriveway when Jones realized his wallet was missing. Jones began\\n\\nsearching Gray’s car for his wallet, and at least one witness testified\\n\\nthat Gray assisted in the search. When the wallet could not be\\n\\nlocated, Jones asked if Gray had taken the wallet and then\\n\\nrequested that Gray empty his pockets. Gray denied taking the\\n\\nwallet but refused to empty his pockets. The two men began\\n\\ndiscussing the matter, which turned into an argument.\\n\\n      During the argument, Gray tried to drive away, but Jones got\\n\\ninto the car to stop Gray from leaving. As one witness described it,\\n\\nGray “tried to pull off, but [Jones] wouldn’t allow him,” and another\\n\\ntestified that Gray was “trying to back out to leave” when Jones\\n\\n\\n      2 Because this case considers whether an error in instructing the jury\\n\\nwas harmless, see Division 2 below, “we review the record de novo, and we\\nweigh the evidence as we would expect reasonable jurors to have done so as\\nopposed to viewing it all in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict.” Jones\\nv. State, \\n317 Ga. 853\\n, 856-57 (2) (\\n896 SE2d 493\\n) (2023) (citation and\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n\\n                                        2\\n jumped into the car. The two men “tussled” over the car key, which\\n\\nwas in the ignition, when Jones grabbed the key and it broke in half.\\n\\nJones retained the electronic key fob that allowed the car to function,\\n\\nwhile the remainder of the key remained stuck in the ignition.\\n\\n     The car’s engine cut off at that point, and the car rolled into the\\n\\nstreet. The two men continued to argue. Jones told Gray that he was\\n\\nnot going anywhere until Jones got his wallet. While both men were\\n\\nstill in the car, Gray pulled a gun out of the driver’s side door pocket\\n\\nand ordered Jones out of the car while demanding his key fob. Jones\\n\\nexited the vehicle in response but did not give up the key fob. Gray’s\\n\\ncar would not restart after Jones got out of the car because Jones\\n\\nhad the key fob.\\n\\n     At some point, as the two men kept arguing, the matter turned\\n\\ninto a physical fight in the street, which did not last long and did not\\n\\nresult in any serious injuries, although Gray had a bloody lip and a\\n\\nblack eye. One witness testified that it was a “fair draw,” and\\n\\nanother witness testified that Jones got the better of Gray but he\\n\\nsaid no one was really hurt, just Gray’s pride. While the evidence is\\n\\n                                   3\\n somewhat conflicting as to when this fight occurred, most of the\\n\\nwitnesses testified that the fight happened after Jones took the key\\n\\nfob and was out of the car.\\n\\n     At some point after the car rolled into the street, Gray, along\\n\\nwith others, including Jones, pushed his vehicle out of the way of\\n\\nother traffic and positioned the car to allow someone to give his car’s\\n\\nbattery a charge. Jones stood in the street by the passenger side of\\n\\nGray’s car, complaining about Gray’s actions in a cell phone call to\\n\\nJones’s cousin, and continued arguing with Gray, who stood by the\\n\\ndriver’s side door demanding his key fob.\\n\\n     Then Gray walked around the front of the car, still demanding\\n\\nhis key fob, and shot Jones approximately six times. Gray continued\\n\\nshooting Jones even after Jones was on the ground. One witness said\\n\\nthat after the first two shots, Jones appeared to go toward Gray\\n\\nbefore he “buckle[d] down to the ground,” and another witness heard\\n\\nJones say, as he lay on the ground, “Don’t kill me.” That witness\\n\\nfurther testified that Gray continued firing even after he grabbed\\n\\nhis key fob from Jones. After getting the key fob, Gray drove away.\\n\\n                                  4\\n The witnesses to the shooting all testified that Jones was unarmed\\n\\nand that only Gray had a weapon. The witnesses denied having seen\\n\\nanyone remove a weapon from Jones after the shooting.\\n\\n     Jones was taken to the hospital by ambulance, but he was\\n\\ndeceased by the time police arrived there to question him.\\n\\nInvestigators did not locate a weapon at the crime scene, nor did\\n\\nthey ever locate the weapon used to shoot Jones. Jones’s wallet was\\n\\nfound five days later in a shopping center parking lot, where he had\\n\\napparently dropped it. Gray was arrested over a month later in\\n\\nOhio.\\n\\n     The medical examiner testified that Jones was shot six times.\\n\\nOne of the wounds was “definitely fatal” and several others were\\n\\n“very serious but potentially not life-threatening.” He said that the\\n\\nwounds reflected that Jones may have been shot while standing,\\n\\nalthough “an equally likely scenario” was that he was shot several\\n\\ntimes after he fell to the ground. The medical examiner did not see\\n\\nany soot or stippling around any of the wounds, so it was more likely\\n\\nthan not that Jones was shot from more than three feet away. Gray\\n\\n                                 5\\n did not testify at trial.\\n\\n     2. Gray argues on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing\\n\\nto give the jury charges he requested on self-defense because slight\\n\\nevidence was presented that he acted to prevent a forcible felony. At\\n\\ntrial, Gray sought a jury charge under OCGA § 16-3-21 (a), which\\n\\nprovides that\\n\\n     a person is justified in using force which is intended or\\n     likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if he or she\\n     reasonably believes that such force is necessary to\\n     prevent death or great bodily injury to himself or herself\\n     or a third person or to prevent the commission of a forcible\\n     felony.\\n\\nOCGA § 16-3-21 (a) (emphasis supplied). A “forcible felony” is\\n\\ndefined as “any felony which involves the use or threat of physical\\n\\nforce or violence against any person.” OCGA § 16-1-3 (6).\\n\\n     “Whether the evidence presented is sufficient to authorize the\\n\\ngiving of a [jury] charge is a question of law,” McClure v. State, \\n306\\n\\nGa. 856\\n, 863 (1) (\\n834 SE2d 96\\n) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted), which this Court reviews de novo. See Reese v. State, \\n314\\n\\nGa. 871\\n, 880 (2) (\\n880 SE2d 117\\n) (2022). “[T]o authorize a jury\\n\\n\\n                                  6\\n instruction, there need only be produced at trial slight evidence\\n\\nsupporting the theory of the charge.” State v. Newman, \\n305 Ga. 792\\n,\\n\\n796-97 (2) (a) (\\n827 SE2d 678\\n) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). But “[e]ven when we find error in a jury charge, we will\\n\\nnot reverse when the error is harmless.” Jones v. State, \\n302 Ga. 892\\n,\\n\\n897 (3) (\\n810 SE2d 140\\n) (2018). See also Hodges v. State, \\n302 Ga. 564\\n,\\n\\n567 (3) (\\n807 SE2d 856\\n) (2017). “The test for determining whether a\\n\\nnonconstitutional instructional error was harmless is whether it is\\n\\nhighly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.”\\n\\nJones v. State, \\n310 Ga. 886\\n, 889 (2) (\\n855 SE2d 573\\n) (2021) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Prior to trial, Gray submitted written requests for jury charges\\n\\non self-defense under OCGA § 16-3-21 (a), false imprisonment, and\\n\\nrobbery. During the charge conference, his counsel asserted that the\\n\\ncharges were authorized because at the time Jones was shot, he was\\n\\nengaged in committing two “ongoing” forcible felonies—robbery and\\n\\nfalse imprisonment—and that Gray shot Jones to stop the felonies\\n\\nfrom continuing. As for robbery, defense counsel argued that when\\n\\n                                 7\\n Jones suddenly snatched Gray’s key fob from his immediate\\n\\npresence, a robbery occurred and continued “as long as the parties\\n\\n[were] out there, and [Gray was] trying to reclaim the key.” Gray\\n\\nalso asserted that Jones was committing false imprisonment when\\n\\nJones told Gray that he could not leave until the wallet was\\n\\nreturned, then “beat” Gray, and stopped him from leaving in his car.\\n\\nDefense counsel asserted that this evidence showed that Gray was\\n\\nbeing detained against his will and that false imprisonment under\\n\\nthese circumstances constituted a forcible felony.\\n\\n     After hearing argument, the trial court denied Gray’s request\\n\\nfor a jury charge on self-defense based on the forcible felonies of\\n\\nrobbery or false imprisonment. The trial court later denied Gray’s\\n\\nmotion for new trial on this ground.\\n\\n     Assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in failing\\n\\nto provide a charge on self-defense to prevent a forcible felony, we\\n\\nconclude that it is highly probable that any error did not contribute\\n\\nto the verdict. The evidence against Gray was strong. Multiple\\n\\nwitnesses saw Gray argue with Jones over whether Gray had taken\\n\\n                                 8\\n Jones’s wallet. These witnesses also saw Gray fight with Jones and,\\n\\nafter the passage of some time, shoot Jones outside the car while\\n\\ndemanding the key fob; Gray then took the key fob and drove away.\\n\\nOne witness testified that Gray shot Jones twice, then stood over\\n\\nJones saying “give me my key,” while Jones said only, “Don’t kill\\n\\nme.” This witness said that Gray then grabbed the key fob and shot\\n\\nJones “like four or more times.” None of the witnesses saw Jones\\n\\nwith a gun, nor does Gray claim that Jones had a gun.\\n\\n     Instead, Gray claims that he was justified in shooting Jones to\\n\\nprevent Jones from committing two forcible felonies—robbery by\\n\\nsudden snatching and false imprisonment. But the evidence\\n\\nsupporting this defense was weak because any robbery had been\\n\\ncompleted at the time of the shooting 3 and the evidence did not\\n\\nsupport that deadly force was reasonably necessary to prevent the\\n\\nalleged false imprisonment. Under Georgia law, “[a] person commits\\n\\nthe offense of robbery when, with intent to commit theft, he takes\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 Gray does not contend that Jones took the key fob to steal his car, but\\n\\nrather to prevent Gray him from leaving until the wallet was returned.\\n                                     9\\n property of another from the person or the immediate presence of\\n\\nanother . . . [b]y sudden snatching.” OCGA § 16-8-40 (a) (3). Gray\\n\\nasserts that Jones committed this crime by snatching his key fob\\n\\nfrom his immediate presence, and further argued that the robbery\\n\\nwas continuing “as long as the parties [were] out there and [Gray\\n\\nwas] trying to reclaim the key.” However, this Court has held that\\n\\nthe “taking” element of robbery “is not a continuing transaction\\n\\nwhich ends only when the defendant leaves the presence of the\\n\\nvictim. Instead, the taking is complete once control of the property\\n\\nis transferred involuntarily from the victim to the defendant, even\\n\\nif only briefly.” Harrington v. State, \\n300 Ga. 574\\n, 577 (2) (a) (\\n797\\n\\nSE2d 107\\n) (2017) (citation and punctuation omitted). See also Fox v.\\n\\nState, \\n289 Ga. 34\\n, 36 (1) (b) (\\n709 SE2d 202\\n) (2011); James v. State,\\n\\n232 Ga. 834\\n, 835 (\\n209 SE2d 176\\n) (1974) (“It is not required that the\\n\\nproperty taken be permanently appropriated.”).\\n\\n     Therefore, even assuming, without deciding, that Jones’s act of\\n\\nsnatching the electronic portion of Gray’s key out of the car’s ignition\\n\\nconstituted the felony of robbery by sudden snatching and that such\\n\\n                                  10\\n a crime is a forcible felony, that crime was complete once Jones took\\n\\ncontrol of the key fob such that a reasonable jury would likely\\n\\nconclude that the subsequent shooting (which took place after a later\\n\\nfight between Gray and Jones and after Gray moved and attempted\\n\\nto re-start his car) was not done to prevent the robbery. See OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-3-21 (a) (justification if defendant reasonably believes that force\\n\\nrequired “to prevent the commission of a forcible felony”). Cf.\\n\\nRobinson v. State, \\n298 Ga. 455\\n, 462 (5) (\\n782 SE2d 657\\n) (2016) (jury\\n\\ncharge on self-defense in prevention of forcible felony addressing\\n\\nshooting death of defendant’s partner in crime by a third party was\\n\\nappropriate because the attempted robbery of third party was an\\n\\nongoing event at the time of the shooting).\\n\\n     Gray also asserts that Jones was engaged in the ongoing crime\\n\\nof false imprisonment at the time of the shooting. Under OCGA § 16-\\n\\n5-41 (a), “[a] person commits the offense of false imprisonment when,\\n\\nin violation of the personal liberty of another, he arrests, confines,\\n\\nor detains such person without legal authority.” Gray argues that\\n\\nthe crime of false imprisonment was a continuing forcible felony in\\n\\n                                  11\\n this case because Jones broke and took Gray’s key fob “for the\\n\\nspecific purpose of preventing him from leaving, thereafter\\n\\nthreatened repeatedly that [Gray] was not going anywhere, and\\n\\nfinally engaged in a fistfight with [Gray] causing violent injury.”\\n\\nEven if false imprisonment under these circumstances could be\\n\\nconsidered a forcible felony, 4 Gray was permitted to use deadly force\\n\\n“only if he . . . reasonably believe[d] that such force [was] necessary\\n\\n. . . to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.” OCGA § 16-3-21\\n\\n(a). The evidence that the shooting was necessary was weak. There\\n\\nwas no evidence that Gray was in any physical danger from being\\n\\nunable to leave the scene in his car, and the evidence supported that\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Although false imprisonment is a felony, OCGA § 16-5-41 (b), nothing\\n\\nin the text of the false imprisonment statute expressly requires the use or\\nthreat of physical force or violence against someone to commit the offense.\\nThus, it is not clear that false imprisonment meets the statutory definition of\\na forcible felony even if the false imprisonment is accompanied by threats. And\\nGray has not pointed us to, nor have we found, any authority where false\\nimprisonment has been defined, or treated based on the evidence presented, as\\na forcible felony under Georgia law. Cf. Patel v. State, \\n278 Ga. 403\\n, 407-08 (6)\\n(\\n603 SE2d 237\\n) (2004) (no error in limiting the jury’s consideration of the\\njustification defense to the situation in which an attack was directed at the\\nperson of defendant and excluding a charge of self-defense based on burglary\\nas a forcible felony because “burglary is not ipso facto a forcible felony” as it\\ndoes not require the use or threat of physical force or violence against any\\nperson).\\n                                       12\\n Gray shot Jones, not because he reasonably believed that the\\n\\nshooting was necessary to free himself, but because he was angry\\n\\nthat Jones did not give up the key fob. Jones was unarmed, yet Gray\\n\\nshot him at least six times, and he kept shooting even after Jones\\n\\nwas on the ground. Gray then left the scene and was later found in\\n\\nanother state. See State v. Orr, \\n305 Ga. 729\\n, 741 (4) (b) (\\n827 SE2d\\n\\n892\\n) (2019) (“[i]t is universally conceded that the fact of an accused’s\\n\\nflight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment,\\n\\nassumption of a false name, and related conduct [is] admissible as\\n\\nevidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.”) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     In other cases where the evidence of guilt was strong and the\\n\\nevidence supporting a justification defense was weak, we have\\n\\nconcluded that it was highly probable that the failure to give a jury\\n\\ninstruction on justification did not affect the verdict and thus\\n\\nconstituted harmless error. See Jones, 310 Ga. at 889 (2) (harmless\\n\\nerror to fail to charge on defense of self or third person because\\n\\n“evidence supporting a charge on defense of self or a third person”\\n\\n                                   13\\n “was meager at best”). See also Reese v. State, \\n317 Ga. 189\\n, 197 (2)\\n\\n(\\n891 SE2d 835\\n) (2023) (where evidence supporting self-defense\\n\\ntheory was weak, failure to give justification instruction likely did\\n\\nnot affect the outcome of the trial); Munn v. State, \\n313 Ga. 716\\n, 723\\n\\n(3) (\\n873 SE2d 166\\n) (2022) (defendant’s substantial rights were not\\n\\naffected by not instructing the jury on justification when evidence in\\n\\nsupport of the defense was weak). Just so here. Accordingly, Gray is\\n\\nnot entitled to a new trial on this ground.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 14\\n '),\n",

CEDRIC ALAN HERBERT v. THE STATE.\\n\\n      Cedric Alan Herbert was convicted of speeding on February 20, 2024, and the\\ntrial court sentenced him to 12 months’ probation. On May 24, 2024, Herbert filed\\na petition for review in the Georgia Supreme Court, which the Court construed as an\\napplication for discretionary appeal and transferred to this Court. We, however, lack\\njurisdiction.\\n      Herbert’s conviction is a directly appealable judgment. See e. g., Brown v. State,\\n351 Ga. App. 808\\n (\\n833 SE2d 202\\n) (2019). And ordinarily, when a party has a right of\\ndirect appeal and files an application for discretionary appeal, we will grant the\\napplication. See OCGA § 5-6-35 (j). However, the application for a discretionary\\nappeal must be filed within 30 days of the order being appealed. See OCGA § 5-6-35\\n(d).

SMITH v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PINSON, Justice.\\n\\n       Truman Harry Smith shot and killed Johnny Crawford while\\n\\nthe two were hanging out with friends. At trial, Smith claimed he\\n\\nkilled Crawford in self-defense. But the jury rejected that defense\\n\\nand convicted Smith of felony murder and other charges. On appeal,\\n\\nSmith contends that the trial court should have allowed him to tes-\\n\\ntify that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (rather\\n\\nthan allowing him only to describe his symptoms), and that the trial\\n\\ncourt should not have allowed the State to impeach him with his\\n\\nprior charge for impersonating another under Article 134 of the Uni-\\n\\nform Code of Military Justice. But the rule of evidence that Smith\\n\\nclaims should have allowed him to testify that he had post-traumatic\\n\\nstress disorder—a hearsay exception for statements for the purpose\\n of medical diagnosis—does not apply to medical diagnoses them-\\n\\nselves, and any error in allowing the State to ask about Smith’s mil-\\n\\nitary charge was harmless. So we affirm Smith’s convictions and\\n\\nsentence.\\n\\n      1. Smith was convicted of felony murder and other crimes in\\n\\nconnection with the shooting death of Crawford.1 The evidence at\\n\\ntrial showed the following. 2\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 The shooting happened on September 15, 2016. On August 16, 2021, a\\n\\nDekalb County grand jury indicted Smith for malice murder, felony murder\\npredicated on aggravated assault, aggravated assault, and possession of a fire-\\narm during the commission of a felony. Smith was tried by a jury from August\\n16 to 20, 2021. The jury did not reach a verdict on the malice murder count,\\nbut it found Smith guilty of the remaining counts. Smith was sentenced to life\\nin prison for felony murder and a consecutive five-year prison term for posses-\\nsion of a firearm during the commission of a felony, for a total sentence of life\\nplus five years. The aggravated assault count merged into the felony murder\\ncount for sentencing, and the trial court dead-docketed the malice murder\\ncount. Through new counsel, Smith filed a timely motion for new trial, which\\nhe amended twice. On July 17, 2023, the trial court denied the motion for new\\ntrial, as amended. Because the dead-docketed malice murder count rendered\\nthe judgment non-final, see Seals v. State, \\n311 Ga. 739\\n (\\n860 SE2d 419\\n) (2021),\\nthe trial court also granted a certificate of immediate review, and we subse-\\nquently granted Smith’s application for interlocutory appeal. Smith filed a\\ntimely notice of appeal. The case was docketed to the term of court beginning\\nin December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n       2 In light of the harmless-error analysis we undertake in Division 3 of\\n\\nthis opinion, “we review the record de novo, and we weigh the evidence as we\\nwould expect reasonable jurors to have done so as opposed to viewing it all in\\nthe light most favorable to the jury’s verdict.” See Moore v. State, \\n315 Ga. 263\\n,\\n264 (1) n.2 (\\n882 SE2d 227\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n                                       2\\n      On the night of the shooting, Smith, Crawford, and two other\\n\\nmen, Dulles Smith (Smith’s cousin) and Randy Castillo, met up at\\n\\nCastillo’s home. Dulles and Castillo had known each other for years,\\n\\nand both of them also knew Smith and Crawford, but the evidence\\n\\nconflicted as to whether Smith and Crawford met for the first time\\n\\nthat night (as Smith said) or had known each other before (as Dulles\\n\\nand Castillo said). At Castillo’s house, the four of them sat in the\\n\\nback of Crawford’s truck drinking beer and tequila and smoking ma-\\n\\nrijuana. At first the group was relaxed, laughing and joking. But at\\n\\nsome point Smith pulled out a handgun and pointed it at Crawford.\\n\\nCastillo and Dulles asked Smith what he was doing. Smith replied,\\n\\n“Man, my fault. I’m tripping, man,” and said he was going to put\\n\\naway the gun. Smith went over to Dulles’s car, then returned to the\\n\\nback of the truck, where he resumed talking with the group.\\n\\n     Some time after that, Smith pulled out his gun again and shot\\n\\nCrawford in the face. The evidence conflicted as to whether this hap-\\n\\npened right when Smith rejoined the group (as Smith said), or some-\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 3\\n what later after he temporarily reconciled with—and even em-\\n\\nbraced—Crawford (as Dulles and Castillo said). Dulles saw the\\n\\nshooting. Castillo, who had just gotten up to go inside, did not see it,\\n\\nbut when he looked back he saw Crawford “falling” into the tailgate\\n\\nof his truck and knew Smith was the shooter because he was the\\n\\nonly one with a gun when the shot was fired. Neither Dulles nor\\n\\nCastillo recalled any argument between Smith and Crawford before\\n\\nthe shooting.\\n\\n     Dulles immediately drove Smith back to Dulles’s house, where\\n\\nSmith got in his own car and left. Dulles then returned to the scene\\n\\nof the shooting. Castillo, meanwhile, had rushed inside and called\\n\\n911. When investigators arrived, Dulles told them that Smith was\\n\\nthe shooter. Five days later, Smith was pulled over for speeding in\\n\\nMissouri. The Missouri officer ran Smith’s driver’s license, learned\\n\\nthat a warrant for his arrest had been issued in Georgia, and placed\\n\\nhim under arrest.\\n\\n     Smith testified in his own defense. He admitted he shot Craw-\\n\\nford, but he said he did so because he feared for his life. Smith said\\n\\n                                   4\\n the first time he pulled out his gun was in response to Crawford’s\\n\\nthreat to rob him like he had robbed “other country mother****ers.”\\n\\nSmith showed Crawford his gun at that point as part of a “de-esca-\\n\\nlation” technique he had learned in the military: “shout, show,\\n\\nshove, shoot.” The situation de-escalated, and Smith put away the\\n\\ngun and walked away to calm down. But after Smith came back to\\n\\nthe group, Crawford said, “[Y]ou’re not the only mother****er with\\n\\na gun,” and reached behind him. Smith knew Crawford had a gun\\n\\nand that he was a “Blood gangbanger.” He shot Crawford to “elimi-\\n\\nnate[ ] the threat.” Smith then fled the scene because he feared\\n\\n“more Bloods were coming out.” Later, he left the state to see a friend\\n\\nin Las Vegas. When he was arrested in Missouri, he was on his way\\n\\nback to Georgia to “take care of business.”\\n\\n     2. Smith contends that the trial court erred by not allowing him\\n\\nto tell the jury that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder\\n\\n(PTSD) and instead allowing him only to describe his symptoms.\\n\\nSmith had indicated before trial and in his opening argument that\\n\\nhis defense would rely at least in part on the effects of PTSD on his\\n\\n                                  5\\n mental state, but because he did not introduce a medical expert or\\n\\nother evidence to establish the diagnosis, the State objected to Smith\\n\\ntestifying about PTSD. The State argued that Smith was not a med-\\n\\nical expert and could not testify about a medical condition. But\\n\\nSmith’s counsel argued that Smith had been diagnosed with PTSD\\n\\nby two physicians, “and so he should be allowed to testify that he\\n\\nhas PTSD based on that diagnosis.” The trial court agreed with the\\n\\nState and ruled that Smith, as a lay witness, could not testify about\\n\\na “clinical medical diagnosis,” but that he could describe his symp-\\n\\ntoms. Smith then testified that he had served in combat in Iraq,\\n\\nwhere, among other things, he was trained to “identify the threat\\n\\nand eliminate the threat.” Since his return home, he remained “hy-\\n\\npervigilant.” He had trouble concentrating, was sensitive to loud\\n\\nnoises, avoided having his back to doorways or having people behind\\n\\nhim, and had nightmares from which he “would wake up yelling,\\n\\ngasping for air.” He also told the jury that he was prescribed antide-\\n\\npressants and pills to control his nightmares, but they did not help,\\n\\nso he self-medicated with marijuana.\\n\\n                                  6\\n      Because Smith made the substance of his proposed testimony\\n\\nknown to the trial court and received a definitive ruling on the rec-\\n\\nord, the issue is preserved for ordinary appellate review. See OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-1-103 (a); McGarity v. State, \\n311 Ga. 158\\n, 162 (2) (\\n856 SE2d\\n\\n241\\n) (2021) (“to preserve an objection to the exclusion of evidence the\\n\\nproponent must either make an offer of proof or otherwise ensure\\n\\nthat the reason for offering the evidence in question is apparent to\\n\\nthe trial court” (cleaned up)).\\n\\n     On appeal, Smith contends that his PTSD diagnosis is a hear-\\n\\nsay statement and that it is admissible under an exception to the\\n\\ngeneral rule of hearsay. Hearsay is a “statement, other than one\\n\\nmade by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered\\n\\nin evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” OCGA § 24-\\n\\n8-801 (c). Hearsay is generally not admissible, see OCGA § 24-8-802,\\n\\nbut it may be admitted if it falls under any of several statutory ex-\\n\\nceptions. See id. One of those exceptions applies to out-of-court state-\\n\\nments “made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and de-\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   7\\n scribing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sen-\\n\\nsations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external\\n\\nsource thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treat-\\n\\nment.” OCGA § 24-8-803 (4) (“Rule 803 (4)”). In Smith’s view, his\\n\\nPTSD diagnosis fits that exception, and the trial court was wrong to\\n\\nexclude it.\\n\\n     The trial court did not err by excluding Smith’s hearsay state-\\n\\nment that he had PTSD, because the hearsay exception of Rule 803\\n\\n(4) does not apply to medical diagnoses. Instead, the rule applies to\\n\\nout-of-court statements that patients make to medical professionals\\n\\nto help the patients get a diagnosis or treatment. The rule refers to\\n\\nstatements “describing medical history, . . . symptoms, pain, or sen-\\n\\nsations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external\\n\\nsource thereof.” OCGA § 24-8-803 (4). Those are things a patient\\n\\nwould tell a doctor—some of which are uniquely within the patient’s\\n\\nknowledge, like his “pain” and “sensations”—when he is seeking\\n\\ntreatment for a complaint or ailment. Such statements are admissi-\\n\\nble despite being hearsay because the patient has an incentive to tell\\n\\n                                  8\\n the truth under those circumstances. See State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga.\\n\\n553\\n, 561-562 (3) (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018) (“[S]tatements made to a pro-\\n\\nvider for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment may be admissible\\n\\nbecause the self-interested motivation of the declarant in wanting\\n\\neffective diagnosis or treatment . . . makes it more likely that the\\n\\nstatements made for that purpose are true.”) (citing White v. Illinois,\\n\\n502 U.S. 346\\n, 356 (112 SCt 736, 116 LE2d 848) (1992)). And when\\n\\nwe apply Rule 803 (4), we ask whether the statement in question\\n\\nenjoys the “guarantee of trustworthiness” that comes from a pa-\\n\\ntient’s desire to get the right treatment when he describes his symp-\\n\\ntoms to a medical professional. See Smith v. State, \\n309 Ga. 240\\n, 245\\n\\n(2) (b) (\\n845 SE2d 598\\n) (2020) (quoting Almanza, \\n304 Ga. at 559\\n (3))\\n\\n(a statement may be admissible under Rule 803 (4) if (1) the “declar-\\n\\nant’s motive in making the statement is consistent with the pur-\\n\\nposes of treatment” and (2) the statement is of a type “reasonably\\n\\nrelied upon by a physician in treatment or diagnosis” (emphasis\\n\\nadded)). All of which is to say that the language of Rule 803 (4), the\\n\\njustification behind it, and our case law applying it all confirm that\\n\\n                                  9\\n it generally applies to statements made by patients to medical pro-\\n\\nfessionals, not to the resulting diagnoses.\\n\\n     Smith points out that we expect doctors to be honest with their\\n\\npatients, just as we expect patients to be honest with their doctors,\\n\\nso Smith repeating a diagnosis he was given by a doctor should have\\n\\nthe same hallmarks of reliability that allow other types of hearsay\\n\\nto be admitted at trial. But the justification for Rule 803 (4)—the\\n\\n“guarantee of trustworthiness” that attaches to a patient’s factual\\n\\ndescription of his symptoms—does not apply in the same way to a\\n\\ndiagnosis, because a doctor’s diagnosis is generally considered an\\n\\nexpert opinion, not a factual assertion. See, e.g., OCGA § 24-7-701\\n\\n(a) (3) (a witness may not give an opinion that is “based on scientific,\\n\\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge” unless she is qualified as\\n\\nan expert); OCGA § 24-7-704 (b) (restricting an “expert witness tes-\\n\\ntifying with respect to the mental state or condition of an accused in\\n\\na criminal proceeding” from opining on whether the defendant had\\n\\nthe required mental state to be guilty of the charged offense); Mid-\\n\\ndlebrooks v. State, \\n315 Ga. 671\\n, 689-690 (2) (b) (\\n884 SE2d 318\\n) (2023)\\n\\n                                  10\\n (discussing various mental health experts’ opinion testimony about\\n\\nthe defendant’s diagnosis); Adams v. State, \\n275 Ga. 867\\n, 870 (\\n572\\n\\nSE2d 545\\n) (2002) (Carley, J., concurring) (“[s]ince paranoia and\\n\\nschizophrenia are medical terms relating to mental disorders, only\\n\\na qualified expert such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or medical\\n\\ndoctor would be competent to diagnose and define such a mental dis-\\n\\norder” (citation and punctuation omitted)).3 Expert opinions are just\\n\\nthat—opinions—and are subject to different standards of reliability\\n\\nand trustworthiness that govern their admission. See generally\\n\\nOCGA § 24-7-702 (discussing qualifications for experts and expert\\n\\nopinions). We have never, so far as we can tell, applied Rule 803 (4)\\n\\nto determine whether an expert opinion was admissible. 4\\n\\n\\n      3 To be clear, while a diagnosis is generally an expert opinion, doctors\\n\\nand other medical professionals can also provide fact or lay testimony. See\\nMcKelvin v. State, \\n305 Ga. 39\\n, 42-43 (2) (b) (\\n823 SE2d 729\\n) (2019) (distinguish-\\ning between a doctor testifying about his drug-testing decisions and offering\\nhis opinion on whether the defendant could have been on substances that were\\nnot tested for, which would be expert testimony, and the doctor merely report-\\ning the results of the drug tests that were performed, which could be lay testi-\\nmony).\\n      4 To the extent that a patient’s past diagnosis is a fact that could be es-\\n\\ntablished by a lay witness—a question we do not decide here—Smith did not\\nseek to introduce his diagnosis that way. He offered no authenticated medical\\n\\n                                       11\\n       In sum, Rule 803 (4) has consistently been applied to allow the\\n\\nintroduction of statements made to medical professionals, not med-\\n\\nical diagnoses, and Smith cites no authority (nor are we aware of\\n\\nany) supporting the introduction of a medical diagnosis under that\\n\\nrule. The trial court therefore did not err by preventing Smith from\\n\\ntestifying that he had PTSD.\\n\\n      3. Smith also contends that the trial court erred by allowing\\n\\nthe State to impeach Smith with his prior charge under the Uniform\\n\\nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ). We review a trial court’s eviden-\\n\\ntiary rulings for abuse of discretion. See Eubanks v. State, \\n317 Ga.\\n\\n563\\n, 584 (6) (\\n894 SE2d 27\\n) (2023).\\n\\n      Smith had called a character witness, Jerry Mike, Smith’s for-\\n\\nmer sergeant from the military, who testified that he would believe\\n\\nSmith if Smith testified under oath. On cross-examination, the State\\n\\nasked whether Mike’s opinion would change “if [he] learned that\\n\\n\\n\\nrecord or other proof of a past diagnosis. See OCGA § 24-7-701 (a) (defining the\\nlimited circumstances in which a lay witness can provide testimony “in the\\nform of opinions or inferences”). Instead, he sought to testify that doctors had\\ntold him he had PTSD. And as discussed above, he argues that the hearsay\\nexception of Rule 803 (4) allowed him to do so.\\n                                      12\\n Truman Smith has been charged in the military with fraudulent use\\n\\nof another’s identity to avoid arrest or detection under Article 134 of\\n\\nthe Uniform[ ] Code of Military Justice.” Smith objected that he had\\n\\nnever been convicted of that charge, so it was not properly admitted\\n\\nas impeachment evidence. See OCGA § 24-6-609 (allowing for a\\n\\ncriminal defendant to be impeached with prior convictions under\\n\\ncertain circumstances). But the State argued that the question fell\\n\\nunder OCGA § 24-6-608 (b), which allows a party to impeach a wit-\\n\\nness with “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of [the] witness” if the\\n\\nconduct is “probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness.” The trial\\n\\ncourt overruled the objection based on OCGA § 24-6-608 (b), and\\n\\nMike then testified that the UCMJ charge would not change his\\n\\nopinion of Smith’s truthfulness.\\n\\n     When a witness has testified about the truthful character of a\\n\\nsecond witness, as Mike did for Smith, the first witness (here, Mike)\\n\\ncan be cross-examined about specific instances of the second wit-\\n\\nness’s conduct (here, Smith’s conduct) that are probative of the sec-\\n\\nond witness’s character for truthfulness. See OCGA § 24-6-608 (b)\\n\\n                                   13\\n (2). But Smith points out on appeal that his UCMJ charge for fraud-\\n\\nulent use of another’s identity did not contain any information about\\n\\nSmith’s conduct that led to the charge, only that he was administra-\\n\\ntively discharged from the military as a result. In Smith’s view, that\\n\\nmeans the UCMJ charge is not a “specific instance[ ]” of conduct un-\\n\\nder OCGA § 24-6-608 (b) (2).\\n\\n     Assuming without deciding that Smith is right that it was an\\n\\nabuse of discretion to allow the State to ask Mike about the UCMJ\\n\\ncharge, the error was harmless. A non-constitutional evidentiary er-\\n\\nror is harmless if it is “highly probable that the error did not con-\\n\\ntribute to the verdict.” Talley v. State, \\n314 Ga. 153\\n, 160 (2) (\\n875 SE2d\\n\\n789\\n) (2022). That test is satisfied here. At trial it was undisputed\\n\\nthat Smith fatally shot Crawford, so the only question was whether\\n\\nhe did so in self-defense. Both third-party eyewitnesses, Dulles and\\n\\nCastillo, testified that they did not recall any argument between\\n\\nSmith and Crawford and that Smith shot Crawford suddenly and\\n\\nwithout provocation. The only evidence to counter Dulles’s and Cas-\\n\\ntillo’s accounts was Smith’s self-serving testimony that Crawford\\n\\n                                  14\\n had threatened him and appeared to be reaching for a gun. Com-\\n\\npared with that mix of evidence, the fact that Smith had been\\n\\ncharged with the non-violent offense of impersonating another was\\n\\nhighly unlikely to have swayed the jury against him. Indeed, Mike\\n\\neven testified that the UCMJ charge would not affect his opinion of\\n\\nSmith’s truthfulness, which the jury could have viewed as mitigat-\\n\\ning against any prejudice the revelation of the UCMJ charge may\\n\\nhave caused. Because the UCMJ charge was highly unlikely to have\\n\\nmade a difference given the evidence as a whole, any error in allow-\\n\\ning the State to ask about it was harmless. See Johnson v. State, \\n316\\n\\nGa. 672\\n, 683-684 (4) (c) (\\n889 SE2d 914\\n) (2023) (harmless error to\\n\\nadmit single pre-autopsy photo of victim given strong evidence of\\n\\ndefendant’s guilt and the fact that the photo was less graphic, and\\n\\nthus less likely to sway the jury, than other evidence); Young v.\\n\\nState, \\n309 Ga. 529\\n, 536-538 (3) (\\n847 SE2d 347\\n) (2020) (harmless er-\\n\\nror to admit photo of defendant holding a gun where evidence of de-\\n\\nfendant’s guilt was strong and the evidentiary value of the photo\\n\\nwas “marginal”).\\n\\n                                 15\\n Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                           16\\n '),\n",

THE STATE.\\n\\n        LAGRUA, Justice.\\n\\n        In these appeals—which have been consolidated for purposes\\n\\nof issuing an opinion—we decide whether an indictment charging\\n\\ntwo former police officers with violations of their oaths of office\\n\\nunder OCGA § 16-10-1 by failing to conduct investigations of other\\n\\npolice officers in purported violation of Brady v. Maryland, \\n373 U.S.\\n\\n83\\n (83 SCt 1194, 10 LE2d 215) (1963), is sufficient to withstand the\\n\\ngeneral demurrers filed in the case below.1 For the reasons that\\n\\nfollow, we conclude that the indictment at issue is not sufficient to\\n\\nwithstand the general demurrers and violates federal constitutional\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 OCGA § 16-10-1 provides that “[a]ny public officer who willfully and\\n\\nintentionally violates the terms of his oath as prescribed by law shall, upon\\nconviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more\\nthan five years.”\\n due process, and thus, the trial court’s order denying the general\\n\\ndemurrers to the indictment should be reversed.\\n\\n      1. Appellant John Powell, formerly the Chief of Police of Glynn\\n\\nCounty, and Appellant Brian Scott, formerly Powell’s Chief of Staff,\\n\\nwere indicted together in the Superior Court of Glynn County for\\n\\nviolation of their oaths as public officers for allegedly violating\\n\\nBrady by failing to promptly investigate certain allegations of police\\n\\nmisconduct, failing to conduct an internal affairs investigation into\\n\\nthis alleged conduct, and/or failing to take other administrative\\n\\naction related to this alleged conduct.2 Specifically, in Count 1 of the\\n\\n\\n      2   On August 20, 2021, a Glynn County grand jury returned the\\nindictment against Powell and Scott, charging Powell with four counts of\\nviolation of oath by a public officer (Counts 1 through 4) and Scott with one\\ncount of violation of oath by a public officer (Count 1). Powell’s and Scott’s oaths\\nof office are attached as exhibits to the indictment. Powell’s Oath of Office\\nstates in pertinent part:\\n       I, JOHN R. POWELL, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will\\n       uphold the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution and\\n       statutes of the State of Georgia, and the Ordinances of the County\\n       of Glynn and that I will faithfully discharge my duties fairly and\\n       impartially as a police officer and as the Chief of the Glynn County\\n       Police Department. . . .\\nScott’s Oath of Office states in pertinent part:\\n       I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will uphold the [C]onstitution\\n       of the United States, the Constitution and statutes of the State of\\n       Georgia and the Ordinances of the County of Glynn. I will\\n       faithfully discharge my duties fairly and impartially as a police\\n                                         2\\n indictment, Powell and Scott were jointly charged with “willfully\\n\\nand intentionally” violating the terms of their oaths of office under\\n\\nOCGA § 16-10-1 in the following manner:\\n\\n     in that they did fail to uphold the Constitution of the\\n     United States, which provides in Article VII, Amendment\\n     V, that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or\\n     property without due process, as interpreted by the U.S.\\n     Supreme Court in Brady v.

Maryland, \\n373 U.S. 83\\n (83 SCt 1194, 10\\n      LE2d 215) (1963), and the said accused, after being\\n      notified that Glynn/Brunswick Narcotics Enforcement\\n      Team officers, hereinafter referred to as GBNET, were\\n      working as law enforcement officers in the State of\\n      Florida, without any legal authority to do so, and that the\\n      GBNET officers requested a Glynn County Police Officer\\n      Kevin Yarborough to effect a traffic stop on a specific\\n      vehicle, and later requested that the Glynn County Police\\n      Officer Kevin Yarborough omit from his official report\\n      involving a fatality that GBNET officers had fact initiated\\n      the traffic stop, . . . fail[ing] to initiate an Internal Affairs\\n      investigation into the conduct of the GBNET officers and\\n      [] fail[ing] to take any administrative action against any\\n      personnel involved. . . .\\n\\n\\n      In November 2021, Powell and Scott each filed a general\\n\\ndemurrer to the indictment,3 asserting, among other things, that the\\n\\n\\n      3 At the same time, Powell and Scott also filed special demurrers to this\\n\\nindictment, as well as separate statutory demands for speedy trial pursuant to\\n                                      5\\n indictment (1) “fails to adequately charge [Powell and Scott] with\\n\\nany offense against the laws of the State of Georgia;” (2) does not\\n\\nform “the bases for a felony criminal offense and therefore cannot be\\n\\nconduct amounting to a violation of [their] oath of office;” and (3)\\n\\n“fails to set forth any description of the way the alleged conduct of\\n\\nthe accused. . . violates the United States Constitution as\\n\\ninterpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in Brady v. Maryland.”\\n\\nPowell and Scott also asserted that the oath-of-office statute, OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-10-1, was “unconstitutionally vague” as applied to the facts of\\n\\nthis case.\\n\\n      At the hearing on the general demurrers, Powell and Scott\\n\\n\\n\\nOCGA § 17-7-170. The special demurrers were denied by the trial court and\\nare not before us on appeal. As for the speedy-trial demands, in October 2022,\\nPowell and Scott filed motions to dismiss the indictment, seeking to be\\ndischarged and acquitted of all charges because they were not tried during the\\nSeptember 2021 term of court or the next term of court, which began in March\\n2022 and ended in September 2022. In November 2022, the trial court held a\\nhearing on the motions to dismiss and subsequently denied the motions. In\\ndenying the motions, the trial court determined, among other findings, that\\nPowell and Scott failed to serve the assigned judge with their speedy-trial\\ndemands and that OCGA § 17-7-170 (a) “specifically requires a defendant [to]\\nserve his speedy-trial demand on both the prosecutor and the judge to whom\\nthe case is assigned.” The trial court concluded that, “[b]ecause Powell and\\nScott failed to strictly comply with the statute, they made no demand for\\nspeedy trial,” and their motions should be denied.\\n                                      6\\n argued that the indictment should be dismissed because they could\\n\\nadmit all the facts alleged therein and not be guilty of any crimes.\\n\\nTo that end, Powell and Scott again argued that the indictment fails\\n\\nto allege any facts constituting a crime; fails to allege any conduct\\n\\namounting to a Brady violation; and fails to identify a particular\\n\\ncase or a particular defendant whose case has been affected by a\\n\\nBrady violation or whose federal constitutional rights have been\\n\\nviolated. The State argued that “[t]here were numerous cases of\\n\\npeople denied their liberty” or “denied their life” by the acts and/or\\n\\nomissions of Powell and Scott, but the State did not identify any such\\n\\ncases. In response, Powell and Scott reiterated that the State had\\n\\nfailed to specify any pending criminal cases that had allegedly been\\n\\nimpacted by a Brady violation on their part, and they argued that\\n\\ntheir federal due process rights would be violated if the State was\\n\\nallowed “to stray from the terms of the indictment” by prosecuting\\n\\nthem based upon cases, actions, or incidents that were not included\\n\\nin the indictment.\\n\\n     The trial court denied the general demurrers, concluding that,\\n\\n                                  7\\n if Powell and Scott were to admit the allegations in the indictment,\\n\\nthe “admission of these allegations would constitute conduct\\n\\nviolative of the oaths of office taken by [Powell and Scott]” and\\n\\nfurther determining that, even if “the underlying conduct charged\\n\\nwas not per se criminal under Georgia law, . . . the conduct alleged,\\n\\nif proven true, would constitute conduct not only grossly\\n\\ninconsistent with that imposed upon [Powell and Scott] by their\\n\\noaths, but also going to the very heart of the obligations they\\n\\nassumed when they took their oaths.” 4\\n\\n      2. We review a trial court’s ruling on a general demurrer “de\\n\\nnovo in order to determine whether the allegations in the indictment\\n\\nare legally sufficient.” State v. Mondor, \\n306 Ga. 338\\n, 341 (1) (830\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 Citing Poole v. State, \\n262 Ga. 718\\n, 719 (\\n425 SE2d 655\\n) (1993), the trial\\n\\ncourt also concluded that OCGA § 16-10-1 was “not unconstitutionally vague\\nas applied to Powell and Scott” and denied their general demurrers on this\\nadditional ground. Powell and Scott appealed the trial court’s ruling—\\nincluding the trial court’s conclusion that OCGA § 16-10-1 was not\\nunconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case—to the Court of\\nAppeals. In their appeals, Powell and Scott also sought review of the trial\\ncourt’s denial of their motions to dismiss the indictment on speedy-trial\\ngrounds. After observing that these appeals invoked our Court’s constitutional\\nquestion jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals transferred the appeals to this\\nCourt in October 2023.\\n  8\\nSE2d 206\\n) (2019) (citation and punctuation omitted). Having done\\n\\nso, we agree with Powell and Scott that the trial court’s ruling\\n\\nregarding the sufficiency of the indictment was erroneous, and their\\n\\ngeneral demurrers should have been granted.\\n\\n     “As a general matter, a demurrer (whether general or special)\\n\\nmust allege some flaw on the face of the indictment itself,” and “a\\n\\ncourt cannot go beyond the four corners of the indictment in\\n\\nconsidering a demurrer.” State v. Williams, \\n306 Ga. 50\\n, 53 (2) (\\n829\\n\\nSE2d 117\\n) (2019). See also Bullard v. State, \\n307 Ga. 482\\n, 486 (2) n.5\\n\\n(\\n837 SE2d 348\\n) (2019) (noting that “the trial court could not look\\n\\nbeyond the four corners of the indictment in considering [the\\n\\ndefendant’s] demurrer”).\\n\\n     To assess the merits of a general demurrer, which\\n     challenges the sufficiency of the substance of the\\n     indictment, a court asks whether the defendant can admit\\n     each and every fact alleged in the indictment and still be\\n     innocent of any crime. If so, the general demurrer should\\n     be sustained. But if the admission of the facts alleged\\n     would lead necessarily to the conclusion that the accused\\n     is guilty of a crime, the indictment is sufficient to\\n     withstand a general demurrer.\\n\\nWilliams, 306 Ga. at 52 (2) (citation and punctuation omitted;\\n\\n                                 9\\n emphasis in original). Framed another way, this Court has held\\n\\nthat, if an indictment “recite[s] the language of the statute that sets\\n\\nout all the elements of the offense charged or allege[s] the facts\\n\\nnecessary to establish a violation of a criminal statute, then the\\n\\nindictment is sufficient to withstand a general demurrer.” Mondor,\\n\\n306 Ga. at 341 (1) (citing Jackson v. State, \\n301 Ga. 137\\n, 141 (1) (\\n800\\n\\nSE2d 356\\n) (2017)).\\n\\n     Here, the indictment lays out the elements of the statutorily-\\n\\ndefined crime of violation of oath of office by a public officer. See\\n\\nOCGA § 16-10-1 (“[a]ny public officer who willfully and intentionally\\n\\nviolates the terms of his oath as prescribed by law shall, upon\\n\\nconviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment for not less than\\n\\none nor more than five years.”). The indictment also specifies which\\n\\nterm of the oath of office Powell and Scott allegedly violated—their\\n\\nobligation “to uphold the Constitution of the United States”—and\\n\\nwhich specific provision thereof—Article VII, Amendment V of the\\n\\nUnited States Constitution as interpreted by the United States\\n\\nSupreme Court in Brady v. Maryland, \\n373 U.S. 83\\n (83 SCt 1194, 10\\n\\n                                  10\\n LE2d 215) (1963). As such, the indictment satisfies the general\\n\\ndemurrer standard as set forth in Mondor and Jackson insofar as it\\n\\n“recite[s] the language of the statute that sets out all the elements\\n\\nof the offense charged.”    Mondor, \\n306 Ga. at 341\\n (1).      See also\\n\\nJackson, \\n301 Ga. at 139\\n (1) (“[T]o withstand a general demurrer, an\\n\\nindictment must . . . recite the language of the statute that sets out\\n\\nall the elements of the offense charged[.]”).\\n\\n     However, under these circumstances, if the indictment here\\n\\nonly recited “the language of the statute that sets out all the\\n\\nelements of the offense charged”—and therefore satisfied the\\n\\ngeneral demurrer standard, Mondor, 306 Ga. at 341 (1)—the\\n\\nindictment would not be sufficient to withstand a special demurrer,\\n\\nwhich “challenges the sufficiency of the form of the indictment.”\\n\\nKimbrough v. State, \\n300 Ga. 878\\n, 880 (2) (\\n799 SE2d 229\\n) (2017)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis in original). “By filing\\n\\na special demurrer, the accused claims . . . that the accused is\\n\\nentitled to more information.”     \\nId. at 880-881\\n (2) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). When considering an indictment under a\\n\\n                                  11\\n special demurrer challenge,\\n\\n      [w]e have held that an indictment not only must state the\\n      essential elements of the offense charged, but it also must\\n      allege the underlying facts with enough detail\\n      to sufficiently apprise the defendant of what he must be\\n      prepared to meet. As we have explained, when a court\\n      considers whether an indictment is sufficient to\\n      withstand a special demurrer, it is useful to remember\\n      that a purpose of the indictment is to allow a defendant\\n      to prepare her defense intelligently.\\n\\nId. at 881\\n (2) (citations and punctation omitted; emphasis supplied).5\\n\\n      Applying those principles here, the indictment at issue charges\\n\\nPowell and Scott with “willfully and intentionally” violating the\\n\\nterms of their oath of office under OCGA § 16-10-1 by failing to\\n\\nuphold the due process clause of the United States Constitution as\\n\\ninterpreted by Brady. Brady stands for the proposition that “the\\n\\nsuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused\\n\\nupon request violates due process where the evidence is material\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 Here, it appears that the State reindicted Powell and Scott after the\\n\\ntrial court granted special demurrers on the first indictment for a lack of\\nsufficient underlying facts, resulting in the indictment presently at issue. The\\nfirst indictment is not part of the record in this case; however, the procedural\\nhistory of that indictment was referenced at the general demurrer hearing in\\nJanuary 2022.\\n                                      12\\n either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad\\n\\nfaith of the prosecution.” Brady, \\n373 U.S. at 87\\n. This Court has\\n\\nexplained that Brady “does not require the pre-trial disclosure of\\n\\nexculpatory evidence,” Davis v. State, \\n261 Ga. 382\\n, 385 (8) (b) (\\n405\\n\\nSE2d 648\\n) (1991) (citation omitted; emphasis supplied), and does not\\n\\nimpose a duty upon the State to investigate. See Brown v. State, \\n250\\n\\nGa. 66\\n, 74 (6) (\\n295 SE2d 727\\n) (1982); Hines v. State, \\n249 Ga. 257\\n,\\n\\n258-259 (1) (\\n290 SE2d 911\\n) (1982); Baker v. State, \\n245 Ga. 657\\n, 661-\\n\\n662 (3) (\\n266 SE2d 477\\n) (1980); Rini v. State, \\n236 Ga. 715\\n, 718 (4)\\n\\n(\\n225 SE2d 234\\n) (1976); Hicks v. State, \\n232 Ga. 393\\n, 394-395 (\\n207\\n\\nSE2d 30\\n) (1974). We have held that, for a criminal defendant to\\n\\nestablish a Brady violation, the following four factors must be met:\\n\\n     (1) the State possessed evidence favorable to [the\\n     accused’s] defense; (2) [the accused] did not possess the\\n     favorable evidence and could not obtain it himself with\\n     any reasonable diligence; (3) the State suppressed the\\n     favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been\\n     disclosed to the defense, a reasonable probability exists\\n     that the outcome of the trial would have been different.\\n\\nDavis v. State, \\n316 Ga. 418\\n, 425 (4) (c) (\\n888 SE2d 546\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n                                  13\\n      As explained above, to withstand a general demurrer in this\\n\\ncase, the State was not required to allege any additional facts in the\\n\\nindictment beyond the statutory elements of OCGA § 16-10-1, but\\n\\nthe State generally must allege additional facts to survive a special\\n\\ndemurrer. Here, the State alleged additional facts, but those facts—\\n\\nnamely, that Powell and/or Scott violated the terms of their oaths of\\n\\noffice by committing Brady violations through their failures to\\n\\ninvestigate and undertake the administrative actions alleged in\\n\\nCount 1 through 4 of the indictment—are inconsistent with the\\n\\ncriminal statute as pleaded and negate the manner in which Powell\\n\\nand Scott purportedly violated the terms of their oaths of office. In\\n\\nother words, here, the indictment alleges that Powell and Scott\\n\\ncommitted these crimes in a specific way. If Powell and Scott admit\\n\\nto that, they are still innocent of the alleged crimes because it is\\n\\nlegally impossible to commit the crimes in the way the State alleged\\n\\nin the indictment.\\n\\n     When we review the sufficiency of an indictment, “we read the\\n\\nindictment as a whole.” Sanders v. State, \\n313 Ga. 191\\n, 196 (3) (a)\\n\\n                                 14\\n (ii) (\\n869 SE2d 411\\n) (2022). We most often rely on this principle to\\n\\nuphold an indictment where one count does not include sufficient\\n\\ndetails, but those details are provided in other counts of the\\n\\nindictment. See \\nid.\\n (determining that an indictment survived a\\n\\ndemurrer because, although the conspiracy count of the indictment\\n\\nfailed to identify a co-conspirator or overt act in furtherance of the\\n\\nconspiracy, “the alleged deficiencies [were] addressed” in another\\n\\ncount of the indictment). See also State v. Wyatt, \\n296 Ga. 257\\n, 260-\\n\\n261 (1) (b) (\\n759 SE2d 500\\n) (2014) (observing that “[w]e will consider\\n\\neach felony murder count and its underlying felony count together,\\n\\nand examine whether the entirety of the indictment provides\\n\\nsufficient detail about the crimes [the defendant] is accused of\\n\\ncommitting” so as to put the defendant on notice of what he will have\\n\\nto defend against at trial). However, here, this principle leads us to\\n\\nconclude that, where the details provided in each count actually\\n\\nnegate the elements of the crimes charged, the indictment is not\\n\\nsufficient to withstand a general demurrer because Powell and Scott\\n\\n“can admit each and every fact alleged in the indictment and still be\\n\\n                                 15\\n innocent of” the crimes alleged by the State. Williams, 306 Ga. at\\n\\n52 (2). And, although we have not articulated this specific rule\\n\\nbefore, it is consistent with our case law.\\n\\n      Accordingly, in this case—even assuming (without deciding)\\n\\nthat a Brady violation could form the basis of a violation of oath of\\n\\noffice charge—the facts as alleged in this indictment do not support\\n\\nsuch a charge because Powell’s and Scott’s purported failures to\\n\\ninvestigate and undertake the administrative actions alleged in\\n\\nCounts 1 through 4 of the indictment are not Brady violations. 6 See\\n\\nDavis, \\n261 Ga. at 385\\n (8) (b). See also Mondor, \\n306 Ga. at 341\\n (1).\\n\\nWe thus conclude that the indictment against Powell and Scott\\n\\n“cannot withstand a general demurrer,” Mondor, \\n306 Ga. at 341\\n (1)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted), and therefore, the trial court’s\\n\\ndenial of Powell’s and Scott’s general demurrers to the indictment is\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 Although we must accept all factual allegations as true, the State’s\\n\\nallegations that this conduct violated Brady are conclusions of law, which we\\nare not required to accept. See Wyatt, \\n295 Ga. at 267-268\\n (3) (“[I]n reviewing\\ndemurrers, the allegations in the indictment are taken as true[.]”) (citing Lowe\\nv. State, \\n276 Ga. 538\\n, 539 (\\n579 SE2d 728\\n) (2003) (explaining that the court\\nmust take the allegations in the indictment as true when evaluating a\\ndemurrer)).\\n                                      16\\n reversed. And, because we have concluded that this indictment\\n\\ncannot withstand a general demurrer, we need not reach Powell’s\\n\\nand Scott’s constitutional challenge or the speedy-trial issue also\\n\\nbefore us on appeal. 7\\n\\n      Judgment reversed.

This appeal asks a critical question: whether the Second\\n\\nAmendment to the United States Constitution permits a State to\\n\\nprohibit someone who has committed a violent felony from\\n\\npossessing firearms during the pendency of a first-offender sentence.\\n\\nSee OCGA § 16-11-131 (b). We are remanding this case back to the\\n\\ntrial court to consider the United States Supreme Court’s recent\\n\\ndecision in United States v. Rahimi, 602 U.S ___ (___ SCt ____, ___\\n\\nLE2d ___) (No. 22-915) (June 21, 2024). But I do not believe that\\n\\nRahimi gives any better guidance in this case than the Supreme\\n\\nCourt’s previous Second Amendment decisions in New York State\\n\\nRifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1 (142 SCt 2111,\\n\\n213 LE2d 387) (2022) and D.C. v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (128 SCt 2783,\\n\\n171 LE2d 637) (2008). The trial court relied on both cases in its order\\n\\ndenying Appellant’s demurrer as well as on this Court’s opinion in\\n\\nSpencer v. State, 286 Ga. 483, 484 (5) (689 SE2d 823) (2010) (holding\\n\\nthat prohibiting a defendant from possessing a firearm as a\\n\\n                                  3\\n condition of probation does not violate the Second Amendment and\\n\\nciting Heller’s declaration that “‘longstanding prohibitions on the\\n\\npossession of firearms by felons’ are not in doubt.” (citing Heller, 554\\n\\nU.S. at 626 (III)). Looking to the facts of this case, I find that Rahimi\\n\\nwould not undercut the trial court’s order. Rather, Rahimi likely\\n\\nsupports the idea that the legislature may disarm those who have\\n\\ncommitted violent crimes like Appellant. See Rahimi 603 U.S. at ___\\n\\n(II) (B) (3) (“the surety and going armed laws confirm what common\\n\\nsense suggests: When an individual poses a clear threat of physical\\n\\nviolence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.”);\\n\\nid. at ____ (repeating Heller’s declaration that felon-in-possession is\\n\\n“presumptively lawful”); id. at ___ (“we do not suggest that the\\n\\nSecond Amendment prohibits the enactment of laws banning the\\n\\npossession of guns by categories of persons thought by a legislature\\n\\nto present a special danger of misuse”); id. at ___ (Barrett, J.,\\n\\nconcurring) (citing her dissent in Kanter v. Barr, 919 F3d 437, 451\\n\\n(7th Cir. 2019), where she explained that “[h]istory is consistent\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   4\\n with common sense: it demonstrates that legislatures have the\\n\\npower to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns.”).\\n\\n     The United States Supreme Court has cautioned that vacating\\n\\nand remanding a case without issuing an opinion is inappropriate\\n\\nwhen the “delay and further cost entailed in a remand are not\\n\\njustified by the potential benefits of further consideration by the\\n\\nlower court.” Lawrence on Behalf of Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U.S.\\n\\n163, 168 (116 SCt 604, 133 LE2d 545) (1996) (per curiam). And I am\\n\\nconcerned that the benefits of remanding this case are far\\n\\noutweighed by the delay and costs. More guidance from the Supreme\\n\\nCourt may be forthcoming, but the governing law as it stands now\\n\\nis sufficient to address Appellant’s claim and (in my opinion) affirm\\n\\nthe trial court’s order. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n     I am authorized to state that Justice Ellington, Justice\\n\\nMcMillian, and Justice Colvin join in this dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   5\\n '),\n",

FORD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n        William Jordan Ford appeals his convictions related to the\\n\\nshooting death of Travron Gill. 1 On appeal, Jordan argues that the\\n\\nevidence was insufficient to support his convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and armed robbery. He also argues that the trial court erred\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 Gill was killed on August 4, 2017. In December 2017, a Fulton County\\n\\ngrand jury indicted Ford for malice murder (Count 1), three counts of felony\\nmurder (Counts 2-4, predicated on armed robbery, aggravated assault, and\\npossession of a firearm by a first offender probationer), armed robbery (Count\\n5), aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Count 6), possession of a firearm\\nduring the commission of a felony (Count 7), and possession of a firearm by a\\nfirst offender probationer (Count 8). At a March 2019 trial, the jury found Ford\\nguilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced Ford to life in prison without the\\npossibility of parole on Count 1, a consecutive life sentence on Count 5, a five-\\nyear term on Count 7 consecutive to Count 5, and a five-year term on Count 8\\nconsecutive to Count 7. The remaining counts were merged or vacated by\\noperation of law. Ford filed a timely motion for new trial, which he later\\namended. The trial court denied Ford’s motion for new trial in June 2023, and\\nhe timely appealed. His appeal was docketed to this Court’s term beginning in\\nDecember 2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n in allowing a forensic witness to testify about aspects of a blood test\\n\\nthat the witness did not perform and that the court should have\\n\\ngranted him a mistrial because the forensic witness was not timely\\n\\ndisclosed as a witness. Ford also argues that the trial court erred in\\n\\nadmitting certain exhibits into evidence because they were not\\n\\nproperly authenticated. We conclude that the evidence was\\n\\nsufficient to support Ford’s convictions, the trial court did not err in\\n\\nallowing the forensic witness to testify or in denying Ford’s mistrial\\n\\nmotion, and any error in admitting the exhibits was harmless.\\n\\nTherefore, we affirm.\\n\\n      The trial evidence showed the following. Travron Gill (also\\n\\nknown as Travion Gill) operated a “trap house,” from which he sold\\n\\nlarge quantities of high-grade marijuana. 2 On August 4, 2017, Ford\\n\\nreached out to Wilbert “Ola” Stephenson, a friend of Gill’s who also\\n\\nsold drugs. Ford went to Stephenson’s workplace driving a Ford\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Because this case turns on an assessment of whether an error was\\n\\nharmless, we lay out the evidence as reasonable jurors would have viewed it\\nrather than in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdicts. See Moore v. State,\\n315 Ga. 263, 264 (1) n.2 (882 SE2d 227) (2022).\\n                                        2\\n Fusion and told Stephenson that he wanted to buy a pound of\\n\\nmarijuana and that he had a firearm for sale. Stephenson was not\\n\\ninterested in the firearm and did not have marijuana to sell, but he\\n\\ndirected Ford to Gill. Stephenson reached out to Gill to let him know\\n\\na “white boy” was on his way to the trap house.\\n\\n     Around that time, Makeith Riggins was renovating a house\\n\\nlocated across the street from the trap house. Riggins testified that\\n\\nhe encountered a white male later identified as Ford. Ford pulled\\n\\ninto the driveway of the house Riggins was working on, got out of\\n\\nhis car, and was “looking kind of crazy.” Ford said he was looking for\\n\\nan “ounce.” Riggins said that Ford did not look like a “weed smoker,\\n\\nhe looked like he wanted something else.” Riggins knew Gill sold\\n\\nonly marijuana, so he directed Ford to a different location. Ford left,\\n\\nbut Riggins saw Ford driving up and down the road a few more\\n\\ntimes.\\n\\n     Ford contacted Stephenson, saying he could not find the trap\\n\\nhouse, and Stephenson sent Ford a picture of the house around 6:20\\n\\np.m. Ford confirmed with Stephenson that he had arrived at the\\n\\n                                  3\\n house. Stephenson and Gill were on the phone at the time, and Gill\\n\\ntold Stephenson that Stephenson’s “buddy” was there. Stephenson\\n\\nheard Gill “fixing up the bags” before he hung up.\\n\\n     Riggins saw Ford back his car onto the driveway of the trap\\n\\nhouse and enter it, and Riggins heard a gunshot while Ford was\\n\\ninside. About five minutes later, Riggins saw Ford exit the house,\\n\\nthrow a black bag into the trunk of his car, and drive away quickly.\\n\\nThe house Riggins had been renovating that day had security\\n\\ncameras. He obtained the surveillance video and provided it to the\\n\\npolice. The recording, which was played for the jury, showed Ford\\n\\ntalking to Riggins, backing into the trap house driveway at 6:23\\n\\np.m., and leaving the house at 6:28 p.m.\\n\\n     Stephenson subsequently tried to call Gill and became worried\\n\\nwhen he could not reach him. Stephenson then tried to contact Ford,\\n\\ncalling him, sending him text messages, and reaching out on\\n\\nInstagram. At a certain point, Stephenson’s calls to Ford would not\\n\\ngo through and he was blocked on Ford’s Instagram.\\n\\n     The next day, Gill’s girlfriend, Brittani Tarver, went to the trap\\n\\n                                  4\\n house because he had not responded to any of her messages. When\\n\\nshe found Gill in the house, unresponsive, she called 911. Police\\n\\nresponded and found Gill lying on the kitchen floor with a gunshot\\n\\nwound to his head. Police also saw blood on an interior doorknob, a\\n\\ncartridge casing next to Gill’s leg, and a bullet in the crevice between\\n\\nthe stove and a kitchen cabinet. Police collected the casing and bullet\\n\\nfor evidence. Police also found marijuana and a digital scale in the\\n\\nkitchen. Police also recovered more than $900 in cash from Gill.\\n\\n     Gill was pronounced dead at the scene and his body was\\n\\ntransported to a medical examiner, who performed an autopsy that\\n\\nsame day. The medical examiner determined that Gill died from a\\n\\ngunshot wound to the head and testified that the fatal gunshot\\n\\nentered behind Gill’s left ear and exited to the right of his eyebrow.\\n\\nThe medical examiner also testified that the condition of Gill’s body\\n\\nwas consistent with Gill having been shot between 6:15 p.m. and\\n\\n6:30 p.m. on the day before.\\n\\n     Based on their investigations, police questioned Stephenson,\\n\\nwho told them about his interactions with Ford and provided a\\n\\n                                   5\\n picture of Ford. Police confirmed Ford’s identity and learned that he\\n\\nhad a 2016 grey Ford Fusion registered in his name. Ford was on\\n\\nfirst-offender probation at the time.\\n\\n     Police went to Ford’s workplace to execute an arrest warrant.\\n\\nWhen approached by police, Ford attempted to flee. Ford was\\n\\nultimately arrested, and the clothing and shoes he was wearing at\\n\\nthe time were submitted for testing by the GBI. The testing of Ford’s\\n\\njeans revealed the presence of gunshot residue, and one of his\\n\\nsneakers had blood on it that matched Gill’s DNA. Police later\\n\\nsearched Ford’s car and found a 9mm Beretta under the driver’s\\n\\nseat. Police also found a bag of marijuana next to a black bag in the\\n\\ntrunk. A forensic analysis revealed that the recovered gun fired the\\n\\nspent casing found next to Gill’s body and the bullet recovered next\\n\\nto the stove in the kitchen. Ford argues that under the standard set\\n\\nforth in Jackson v.\\n\\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979), the\\n\\nevidence was insufficient to support his convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and armed robbery. We disagree.\\n\\n                                  6\\n      When evaluating the legal sufficiency of evidence, we view the\\n\\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and inquire\\n\\nwhether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. “Under\\n\\nthis review, we must put aside any questions about conflicting\\n\\nevidence, the credibility of witnesses, or the weight of the evidence,\\n\\nleaving the resolution of such things to the discretion of the trier of\\n\\nfact.” Mims v. State, 304 Ga. 851, 853 (1) (a) (823 SE2d 325) (2019)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     The evidence described above was plainly sufficient to support\\n\\nFord’s murder conviction. There was testimony that Ford went to\\n\\nGill’s house to purchase marijuana, Gill confirmed to Stephenson\\n\\nthat Ford had arrived, and Riggins saw Ford enter Gill’s house and\\n\\nheard a gunshot shortly thereafter. Surveillance video footage\\n\\nplayed for the jury confirmed Ford’s presence at Gill’s house at the\\n\\ntime of the shooting. Forensic evidence showed that the gun\\n\\nrecovered from Ford’s vehicle was the murder weapon and that one\\n\\nof his sneakers had blood on it that matched Gill’s DNA. Ford’s\\n\\n                                  7\\n conduct following the shooting also showed a consciousness of guilt.\\n\\nFord had been in frequent contact with Stephenson until he arrived\\n\\nat Gill’s house but subsequently did not respond to Stephenson’s\\n\\nmessages and blocked him on social media. He also attempted to flee\\n\\nwhen police approached him. See Jenkins v. State, 313 Ga. 81, 89 (3)\\n\\n(868 SE2d 205) (2022) (an accused’s flight, resistance to arrest,\\n\\nconcealment, and other related conduct “is admissible as evidence of\\n\\nconsciousness of guilt for the charged offense, and thus of guilt itself”\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted)). This evidence far exceeds the\\n\\nthreshold for sufficiency under Jackson.\\n\\n     Ford argues that he countered the State’s evidence that he shot\\n\\nGill with malice, because there was money left behind at the scene\\n\\nof the crime. But as we have stated before, “[i]t is for a jury to\\n\\ndetermine from all the facts and circumstances whether a killing is\\n\\nintentional and malicious.” Benton v. State, 305 Ga. 242, 244 (1) (a)\\n\\n(824 SE2d 322) (2019). Because the evidence showed that Gill was\\n\\nshot in the head while Ford was in the house and that Ford left the\\n\\nscene without rendering aid, the jury was authorized to conclude\\n\\n                                   8\\n that Ford was guilty of the crime of malice murder. See, e.g., Benton,\\n\\n305 Ga. at 244 (1) (a) (evidence sufficient to support finding of malice\\n\\nmurder where, among other things, appellant left the victim after\\n\\nshooting him); Moran v. State, 302 Ga. 162, 163 (1) (b) (805 SE2d\\n\\n856) (2017) (jury authorized to find evidence of malice where, among\\n\\nother things, the defendant shot the victim in the back of the head).\\n\\n     Ford argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his\\n\\narmed robbery conviction solely because the State did not prove he\\n\\ntook anything from Gill when cash and other items of value were\\n\\nfound at Gill’s house following the shooting, and the State could not\\n\\nprove that the marijuana found in his trunk was taken from Gill.\\n\\nHis argument fails.\\n\\n     The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that Ford at\\n\\nleast took marijuana. The evidence clearly established that Ford\\n\\nwas attempting to acquire marijuana, and he went to Gill’s house\\n\\nfor that purpose. Stephenson said that when Gill confirmed Ford’s\\n\\narrival, it sounded like Gill was “fixing up the bags.” The evidence\\n\\nshows that after Gill was shot in the kitchen, which contained\\n\\n                                   9\\n marijuana and a digital scale, Ford left Gill’s house with a black bag\\n\\nand placed it in his trunk. When Ford was later arrested, marijuana\\n\\nwas found in the trunk of Ford’s vehicle and located next to a black\\n\\nbag. Although there is no specific evidence that the marijuana found\\n\\nin Ford’s vehicle was similar to the marijuana that Gill sold, a jury\\n\\ncould infer from the circumstances, especially Ford leaving Gill’s\\n\\nresidence with a black bag, that Ford at least took marijuana from\\n\\nGill. Accordingly, Ford’s argument to the contrary fails. See\\n\\nThornton v. State, 312 Ga. 224, 227-228 (1) (862 SE2d 113) (2021)\\n\\n(rejecting argument that there was no evidence showing when or\\n\\nhow the defendant obtained the victim’s property because the\\n\\ndefendant had a knife when he encountered the victim and jury\\n\\ncould conclude from evidence whether he obtained property by\\n\\narmed robbery); Waller v. State, 311 Ga. 517, 522-523 (2) (a) (858\\n\\nSE2d 683) (2021) (based on evidence presented, the jury was\\n\\nauthorized to make the reasonable inference that the defendant took\\n\\nthe victim’s property).\\n\\n     2. Ford next argues that the trial court erred in allowing\\n\\n                                 10\\n forensic technician Angela McCray to testify about a “blood stain\\n\\ncard” that was later used to compare Gill’s blood against that\\n\\ncollected from Ford’s sneaker. McCray testified that she was present\\n\\nfor the autopsy and personally drew Gill’s blood and placed blood\\n\\ndroplets on the blood stain card. Ford argues that McCray’s\\n\\ntestimony was based on hearsay testimony, pointing to her response\\n\\nto questioning about how she knew she had some personal\\n\\ninvolvement with the blood stain card. The prosecutor asked\\n\\nMcCray, “How do you know that you had any connection with the\\n\\nautopsy regarding [the blood stain card]?” McCray responded, “Well,\\n\\nI know because I was able to look over the case before I came here,\\n\\nand I saw that I was the assigned technician on that case, meaning\\n\\nthat I assisted the pathologist with the autopsy on that case.”\\n\\n     Ford’s hearsay claim is meritless. Hearsay is defined as “a\\n\\nstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at\\n\\nthe trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the\\n\\nmatter asserted.” OCGA § 24-8-801 (c). But McCray did not testify\\n\\nabout something someone else told her; instead, she testified about\\n\\n                                 11\\n what she personally did. See OCGA § 24-6-602 (a witness’s own\\n\\ntestimony may prove that she has personal knowledge of the matter\\n\\nat issue); see also Brown v. State, 314 Ga. 193, 200 (3) (875 SE2d\\n\\n784) (2022) (witnesses’ knowledge of shooting was not based on\\n\\nhearsay where they were present at crime scene and described their\\n\\nobservations of shooting); Kirby v. State, 304 Ga. 472, 478 (3) (b) (819\\n\\nSE2d 468) (2018) (reviewing case law that a witness can testify only\\n\\nas to that of which the witness has personal knowledge and that\\n\\nrelaying information told to the testifying witness constitutes\\n\\ninadmissible hearsay).\\n\\n     Ford also claims that McCray’s testimony constituted\\n\\n“surrogate testimony” under Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S.\\n\\n647 (131 SCt 2705, 180 LE2d 610) (2011). There, the United States\\n\\nSupreme Court held that testimony about a lab test by a witness\\n\\nwho did not perform or observe the test reported in the certification\\n\\nviolates the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause. But McCray\\n\\ntestified that she personally drew the blood and placed it on the\\n\\nblood stain card, and McCray provided no testimony about the\\n\\n                                  12\\n results of any tests run on that blood stain card. Therefore, Ford’s\\n\\nBullcoming claim fails.\\n\\n         3. Ford alternatively argues that the court should have granted\\n\\nhis request for a mistrial because McCray was not identified on any\\n\\nof the State’s witness lists or in discovery. We disagree.\\n\\n         A trial court has broad discretion as to whether to grant a\\n\\nmistrial, and we will not disturb a court’s decision not to grant one\\n\\nunless there is a showing that a mistrial was essential to preserve a\\n\\nparty’s right to a fair trial. See Jordan v. State, 305 Ga. 12, 15 (2)\\n\\n(823 SE2d 336) (2019); Ragan v. State, 299 Ga. 828, 833-834 (3) (792\\n\\nSE2d 342) (2016). A trial court has the discretion to fashion an\\n\\nappropriate remedy for a violation of the discovery statutes,\\n\\nincluding whether to grant a mistrial. See OCGA § 17-16-6; Tubbs\\n\\nv. State, 276 Ga. 751, 753-754 (3) (583 SE2d 853) (2003). Ford fails\\n\\nto show that a mistrial was necessary to preserve his right to a fair\\n\\ntrial.\\n\\n         On the fourth day of his trial, the State notified Ford just after\\n\\nlunch that it intended to call McCray in order to establish the chain\\n\\n                                      13\\n of custody for the blood stain card. McCray was not the next witness\\n\\nto be called. Ford moved for a mistrial because he was not provided\\n\\nMcCray’s name prior to trial, but he made no request for a\\n\\ncontinuance or any other remedy for the purported discovery\\n\\nviolation. The trial court denied his mistrial motion without\\n\\nexplanation.\\n\\n     Ford argues that the court should have granted him a mistrial\\n\\nbecause he was not prepared to cross-examine McCray, as he did not\\n\\neven know of her existence before trial. But McCray’s testimony was\\n\\nvery brief, limited only to her description of having collected blood\\n\\nfrom Gill and placing it on the blood stain card. Ford makes no\\n\\nshowing of how advance notice of McCray’s testimony would have\\n\\nmade any difference with respect to his cross-examination of her. He\\n\\nalso argues that, due to the lack of notice, he was unable to\\n\\ninvestigate the collection of the blood stain card prior to trial. He\\n\\nmakes no claim, however, that he was unaware that blood was\\n\\ncollected from Gill, placed on a blood stain card, or tested. In other\\n\\nwords, he has not shown how McCray’s omission from witness lists\\n\\n                                 14\\n precluded him from investigating the blood stain card, nor has he\\n\\nshown how additional time would have helped his defense. Ford’s\\n\\narguments about how he was harmed by the omission of McCray’s\\n\\nname from the State’s witness list are purely speculative and are\\n\\ninsufficient to show that the denial of a mistrial motion was an\\n\\nabuse of discretion. See Platt v. State, ___ Ga. ___, ___ (2) (i) (__ SE2d\\n\\n__) (2024) (rejecting claim that the trial court erred in denying\\n\\nmotion for mistrial based on State’s failure to disclose the existence\\n\\nof a recording of a statement by the defendant, because the\\n\\ndefendant did not show how an earlier disclosure would have\\n\\nbenefitted him, and his suggestion that he would have cross-\\n\\nexamined witnesses differently if he was aware of the recording was\\n\\n“vague and unsupported”).\\n\\n     4. Ford argues that the trial court erred in admitting into\\n\\nevidence exhibits containing cellphone data extracted from four\\n\\ncellphones. Ford argues that the exhibits were not properly\\n\\nauthenticated. But any error in admitting the exhibits was\\n\\nharmless.\\n\\n                                   15\\n      At trial, Detective Mark Taylor testified that he was\\n\\nresponsible for downloading or extracting data from mobile devices.\\n\\nThe State tendered into evidence State’s Exhibits 90 through 93, and\\n\\nDetective Taylor identified the exhibits as thumb drives containing\\n\\ndata extracted from certain cellphones, and the labels on the thumb\\n\\ndrives corresponded to the owner of the cell phone. The thumb drives\\n\\nwere labeled “Ford Dump”, “Vic Dump,” “Ola Stephenson,” and\\n\\n“Tarver.”\\n\\n     Ford objected based on lack of foundation and failure to\\n\\nestablish a chain of custody because “we do not have the phones to\\n\\nknow which actual phones were dumped.” Detective Taylor testified\\n\\nthat he reviewed the exhibits, and they contained the data extracted\\n\\nfrom the devices. He testified that he received the actual phones\\n\\nfrom the lead detective and took photographs of the phones,\\n\\nincluding the identification numbers for each. The court admitted\\n\\nthe exhibits, overruling Ford’s objections based on hearsay and\\n\\nchain of custody grounds.\\n\\n     On appeal, Ford argues that the State failed to authenticate\\n\\n                                16\\n Exhibits 90 through 93 properly because Detective Taylor had no\\n\\npersonal knowledge about the ownership of the cell phones and his\\n\\nknowledge was based on hearsay information gained from the lead\\n\\ndetective. But regardless of whether Exhibits 90 through 93 were\\n\\nproperly authenticated, any error in their admission was harmless.\\n\\n     “The test for determining nonconstitutional harmless error is\\n\\nwhether it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the\\n\\nverdict.” Kirby v. State, 304 Ga. 472, 478 (3) (c) (819 SE2d 468)\\n\\n(2018) (citation and punctuation omitted). The State bears the\\n\\nburden of showing harmlessness. Bozzie v. State, 302 Ga. 704, 708\\n\\n(2) (a) (808 SE2d 671) (2017).\\n\\n     Any error here was harmless because the evidence of guilt was\\n\\noverwhelming. The surveillance video shows Ford inside Gill’s house\\n\\nbetween 6:23 p.m. and 6:28 p.m. on the day of Gill’s death, and the\\n\\nmedical examiner testified that the condition of Gill’s body was\\n\\nconsistent with a time of death between 6:15 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.\\n\\nRiggins said that after he saw Ford go inside Gill’s house, he heard\\n\\na gunshot and then saw Ford leave. When Ford was arrested, the\\n\\n                                 17\\n murder weapon was found in his car, and one of his shoes had blood\\n\\non it that had the presence of Gill’s DNA.\\n\\n     Ford argues that the data contained in Exhibit 90 through 93\\n\\nwere critical to the State’s case because it corroborated important\\n\\naspects of Stephenson’s testimony, including that Ford went to Gill’s\\n\\nhouse shortly before 6:30 p.m. on the day of Gill’s death and that\\n\\nStephenson sent Ford a text message containing a picture of Gill’s\\n\\nhouse when Ford was lost. Ford argues that the State needed to\\n\\ncorroborate Stephenson’s testimony because he was arguably an\\n\\naccomplice based on conspiring with Ford to arrange a drug\\n\\ntransaction with Gill.\\n\\n     But even if this were true, other evidence corroborated\\n\\nStephenson’s testimony: surveillance video footage showed that\\n\\nFord arrived at Gill’s house around 6:23 p.m. and Riggins testified\\n\\nthat Ford was driving around looking for drugs. Therefore, the\\n\\nexhibits were not critical to the State’s case. Under these\\n\\ncircumstances, it is highly probable that any error in admitting the\\n\\nexhibits did not contribute to the verdicts.\\n\\n                                  18\\n Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                           19\\n '),\n",

DARRYL ROBINSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n       In 2018, a jury found Darryl Robinson guilty of armed robbery, possession of\\na firearm during a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The trial\\ncourt sentenced Robinson to life imprisonment without parole plus five years.\\nRobinson’s attorney filed a timely motion for new trial, and appellate counsel filed an\\namended motion, which the trial court denied on March 31, 2020.

MILTON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n         MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n         Jarvis Lamont Milton was convicted of murder and other\\n\\ncrimes in connection with the shooting death of Frederick Cade.1\\n\\n\\n         1 Frederick Cade was killed on the night of August 13-14, 2017. Milton\\n\\nand Richard Stroud, Jr., were indicted by a Wilkes County grand jury on\\nFebruary 4, 2019, individually and as parties to a crime and co-conspirators,\\non charges of violating the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act (Count\\n1), malice murder (Count 2), felony murder (Count 3), possession of a firearm\\nin the commission of a crime (Count 4), and aggravated assault (Count 5).\\nAfter Stroud’s case was severed, Milton was tried before a jury in May 2019\\nand found guilty on all counts. On May 10, 2019, the trial court sentenced\\nMilton to life in prison, without the possibility of parole on Count 2 and to five\\nyears in prison on Count 4, to run consecutively to Count 2. Counts 1 and 5\\nwere merged into Count 2 for sentencing purposes, and Count 3 was vacated\\nby operation of law. Although it appears that the Gang Act charge was\\nimproperly merged into the murder conviction, see Lupoe v. State, \\n300 Ga. 233\\n,\\n239 (1) (\\n794 SE2d 67\\n) (2016) (“[T]he gang activity counts did not merge as that\\ncrime and malice murder each require proof of an element that the other does\\nnot.”), we decline to exercise our discretion to correct that merger error, which\\nhas not been raised by the State. See Dixon v. State, \\n302 Ga. 691\\n, 698 (4) (\\n808\\nSE2d 696\\n) (2017) (“[W]e have determined that, when a merger error benefits a\\ndefendant and the State fails to raise it by cross-appeal, we henceforth will\\nexercise our discretion to correct the error upon our own initiative only in\\n Milton appeals his convictions, asserting in his sole enumeration of\\n\\nerror that the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient for a\\n\\nrational trier of fact to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of\\n\\nthe crimes of which he was convicted as required by Jackson v.\\n\\nVirginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). We affirm\\n\\nfor the reasons that follow.\\n\\n      1. The evidence at trial showed that in August 2017, Cade was\\n\\nmarried to Shakevia Graves, who had an eight-year-old son, D.G.,\\n\\nwith Milton’s co-indictee, Richard Stroud, Jr. At that time, Milton\\n\\nhad been dating Shakevia’s twin sister, Shanevia (“NeNe”) Graves\\n\\nfor six to seven years.2 Shakevia and Cade’s marriage was volatile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nexceptional circumstances.”). Stroud was tried separately in November 2019,\\nand his appeal is before this Court as Case No. S24A0069.\\n      Milton filed a motion for new trial on May 28, 2019, and a second motion\\nasserting the same grounds on June 26, 2019; an amended motion for new trial\\nwas filed on August 15, 2022. The trial court denied Milton’s motion as\\namended on July 20, 2023. Milton filed a notice of appeal on July 28, 2023, and\\nan amended notice of appeal on August 9, 2023. This appeal was docketed to\\nthe term of this Court beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a\\ndecision on the briefs.\\n      2 Because the Graves sisters’ names are so similar and to avoid\\n\\nconfusion, we will refer to Shakevia by her full name and Shanevia by her\\nnickname, “NeNe,” which is how the witnesses and counsel primarily referred\\nto her at trial.\\n                                      2\\n The two would often argue and their arguments would sometimes\\n\\nturn physical. As a result, Shakevia often stayed at her\\n\\ngrandparents’ house, which was where NeNe was living. Shakevia\\n\\ntestified that there was “bad blood” between Cade and Stroud\\n\\nbecause Cade was jealous of the time Shakevia spent with Stroud\\n\\nand that the two men also argued over Stroud’s failure to contribute\\n\\nto D.G.’s support.\\n\\n     On Sunday, August 13, 2017, Cade and Shakevia were not\\n\\ngetting along and Shakevia had spent the prior week at her\\n\\ngrandparents’ house. That Sunday night, she and NeNe decided to\\n\\ndrive to a nearby business. While they were parked there, they saw\\n\\nCade driving up in his truck, and the sisters sped off, with Shakevia\\n\\ndriving. Cade followed them, and both vehicles drove through the\\n\\nneighborhood until Shakevia pulled into her grandparents’ house.\\n\\nCade pulled behind the sisters’ car but did not get out and instead\\n\\ndrove away.\\n\\n     In the interim, NeNe texted Milton to bring them cigarettes,\\n\\nand a short time later Stroud drove Milton to the grandparents’\\n\\n                                 3\\n house in Stroud’s car. NeNe got into the backseat of Stroud’s car,\\n\\nwhile Shakevia approached the car to get a cigarette. As Shakevia\\n\\nleaned inside the car, Cade “came out of nowhere” and pushed\\n\\nShakevia from behind. Both Shakevia and Cade fell inside the\\n\\nbackseat of Stroud’s car still “tussling.” Shakevia got out of the car\\n\\nand ran to the porch of the house, with Cade following her.\\n\\n     As this altercation was occurring, Stroud and Milton were\\n\\ntelling Cade to stop. Milton told Cade that he was “f**ked up about\\n\\n[himself] for putting [his] hands on [Shakevia] in front of her\\n\\ngrandma,” and Milton called Cade a “p***y n****r” for doing that.\\n\\nStroud argued with Cade for fighting Shakevia, his “baby mama,” in\\n\\nStroud’s car. When the sisters’ grandparents came out of the house\\n\\nin response to the altercation, Stroud escorted Cade off the porch,\\n\\nand Cade walked away. Shakevia testified that Stroud, Milton, and\\n\\nNeNe then drove away in Stroud’s car in the direction opposite from\\n\\nwhere Cade was walking. Shakevia stayed behind and began\\n\\nrepeatedly calling and texting Cade but never got a response.\\n\\n     Shakevia testified that NeNe returned to the house “in a rage”\\n\\n                                  4\\n and “cussing” less than an hour after she left. NeNe told Shakevia\\n\\nthat Shakevia was “stupid as hell” for calling Cade’s phone “while\\n\\nthey up there fighting.” When Shakevia asked what had happened,\\n\\nNeNe did not answer, but only said that “you and everybody else\\n\\ngoing to know what happened to him tomorrow.”\\n\\n     Cade’s body was discovered early on the morning of August 14,\\n\\n2017, lying on the pavement in an isolated area near the\\n\\ngrandparents’ house. Witnesses at the scene, including attending\\n\\nmedical personnel and police investigators, observed that Cade\\n\\nappeared to have suffered at least one gunshot wound to the arm\\n\\nand that he also had an injury to his torso. Emergency medical\\n\\nservices personnel called to the scene detected no signs of life.\\n\\nInvestigators also observed that Cade’s body and clothing were\\n\\nmuddy. And they discovered muddy shoe prints and a blood trail\\n\\nbeginning near a muddy area on the side of the road about 20 yards\\n\\nfrom Cade’s body. The blood trail ended at the body, suggesting that\\n\\nCade had traveled for some distance before collapsing to the\\n\\npavement. Blood samples taken from the blood trail on the roadway\\n\\n                                 5\\n were later identified as matching a blood sample obtained from\\n\\nCade’s body during his autopsy.\\n\\n     Agents from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (“GBI”)\\n\\narrived at the grandparents’ house around 5:00 a.m. to inform\\n\\nShakevia that Cade was dead. Afterwards, NeNe and Shakevia were\\n\\ninterviewed at the Wilkes County Sheriff’s office by GBI Agents\\n\\nDerrick Glasco and Austin Bradshaw. Agent Bradshaw first\\n\\nquestioned Shakevia at 6:20 a.m., and she told the agent that NeNe\\n\\nhad driven away with Stroud and Milton from the house, but she did\\n\\nnot know who had shot Cade. Meanwhile, Agent Glasco began\\n\\ninterviewing NeNe at 6:43 a.m., and as NeNe acknowledged at trial,\\n\\nher stories “changed numerous . . . times.” NeNe first told Glasco\\n\\nabout the altercation between Cade and Shakevia, but she never\\n\\nmentioned that Stroud or Milton were at her grandparents’ house or\\n\\nthat she was with them after the altercation. Instead, NeNe said she\\n\\nsmoked a cigarette after the altercation and went into the house.\\n\\n     When Agent Bradshaw joined Agent Glasco and NeNe at\\n\\naround 7:00 a.m., the agents began to video record the interview.\\n\\n                                  6\\n NeNe continued to maintain that she had not left her grandparents’\\n\\nhouse, although she eventually told the agents that Milton and\\n\\nStroud were at the house during the altercation between Cade and\\n\\nShakevia.3 But when the agents accused NeNe of lying and\\n\\nsuggested that she was covering for her boyfriend, Milton NeNe\\n\\nsaid, “Jarvis [Milton] shot Pooh,” which was Cade’s nickname. She\\n\\nstated that Stroud and Milton came over to the grandparents’ house\\n\\nto pick up NeNe and Shakevia, and as the sisters were getting into\\n\\nthe car with the two men, Cade came up behind Shakevia and\\n\\npushed her in the car, leading to the altercation. NeNe also admitted\\n\\nthat she left in Stroud’s car with Stroud and Milton after Cade left.\\n\\nNeNe said that as they drove away from the house, Stroud and\\n\\nMilton decided to follow Cade, and they caught up with him walking\\n\\nalong the road. When they drove up, Cade began yelling, and Milton\\n\\nand Stroud yelled back. Stroud then said, “F**k it, let’s go beat him\\n\\nup.” Both Stroud and Milton got out of the car while NeNe stayed in\\n\\nthe car. When the two men got out of the car, Cade immediately hit\\n\\n\\n     3 Neither GBI agent had interviewed Stroud or Milton at that point.\\n\\n                                    7\\n Stroud, leading to a “two-on-one” fight, with Stroud and Milton\\n\\nfighting Cade. NeNe then heard a gunshot, but she never saw a gun.\\n\\nShe thought Milton shot Cade because she heard Stroud say,\\n\\n“Damn, boy, you done f**ked up.” When the three drove away from\\n\\nthe scene, NeNe saw Cade running up the road, and he appeared to\\n\\nbe holding his arm. Stroud and Milton then took NeNe to her\\n\\ngrandparents’ house at her request, and she ran inside.\\n\\n     When asked at trial why her stories changed during the\\n\\ninterview, NeNe testified that she first said she had not left her\\n\\ngrandparents’ house because she was scared and nervous and did\\n\\nnot want anyone to know that she was at the scene of the shooting\\n\\nor in any way involved. She testified that after the GBI agents told\\n\\nher that her story was false, she told them that Milton shot Cade\\n\\nbecause she thought that was what they wanted to hear as they had\\n\\naccused her of trying to protect her boyfriend and they were\\n\\nthreatening that she could be charged with a crime if she did not tell\\n\\nthem what had happened. NeNe said that to avoid being charged\\n\\nshe “was willing to tell them anything.” Agent Bradshaw testified,\\n\\n                                  8\\n however, that he “just tried to make it clear to her how serious this\\n\\nwas, that a man had lost his life, and if she was in the vehicle, her\\n\\nwithholding information she could potentially be charged.” This\\n\\nportion of NeNe’s videotaped interview was played for the jury.4\\n\\n     Agent Bradshaw testified that, after he interviewed both\\n\\nsisters that morning, he went back to the crime scene at 8:20 a.m. to\\n\\nview the scene in the daylight, as the area had been dark earlier in\\n\\nthe morning. While at the scene, near an area on the side of the road\\n\\nwhere it looked like the mud had been freshly turned up and the\\n\\nblood trail and muddy shoe prints began, he discovered a gold\\n\\npendant “jammed up in the mud.” Agent Bradshaw later matched\\n\\nthe pendant to a profile picture from Stroud’s Facebook page, which\\n\\nshowed him wearing a necklace with a very similar pendant. The\\n\\nprofile picture was posted to Stroud’s page on August 3, 2017, ten to\\n\\n\\n     4 The video reflects that Agent Bradshaw told NeNe that he knew she\\n\\nwas leaving things out of her story because he had already talked to Shakevia.\\nHe told NeNe that the agents knew that she had left the house with Milton\\nand Stroud. Agent Bradshaw told NeNe that she was implicating herself by\\nnot being truthful and because a man had died, she could be charged with\\nmurder as she was in the car and lied to police about what happened. The agent\\nthen posited that NeNe was there when Cade was shot and saw what\\nhappened, but she was covering for her boyfriend.\\n                                      9\\n eleven days before Cade was shot.\\n\\n     Agent Bradshaw interviewed Stroud at 8:52 a.m. the same\\n\\nmorning. During the interview, Stroud gave the GBI permission to\\n\\nsearch his car, where investigators located mud and blood smears\\n\\nboth inside and outside of the vehicle. A blood smear located on the\\n\\nvehicle’s front center console was later determined to match Cade’s\\n\\nblood sample. Milton was arrested later that afternoon, and Agent\\n\\nBradshaw interviewed him at 2:52 p.m. that day. The agent testified\\n\\nthat Milton said that after the altercation occurred at the\\n\\ngrandparents’ house, Stroud drove him and NeNe to Milton’s house.\\n\\nMilton said they did not make any stops and denied having any\\n\\nknowledge or involvement in Cade’s death.\\n\\n     At Milton’s trial, NeNe again changed her story about what\\n\\nhappened that night. She testified that Stroud and Milton did not\\n\\ngo looking for Cade after they left the grandparents’ house, but,\\n\\ninstead, they just happened upon him walking in the road. She said\\n\\nStroud stopped the car, and Stroud and Cade were yelling at each\\n\\nother. Although NeNe stated in her interview that both Milton and\\n\\n                                10\\n Stroud fought with Cade in a “two-on-one” fight, at trial she testified\\n\\nthat Milton tried to be the peacemaker, that he told Stroud, “y’all\\n\\ncan deal with that on another time,” and that only Stroud fought\\n\\nwith Cade. NeNe testified that while Cade and Stroud were fighting,\\n\\nMilton stood beside NeNe’s side of the car smoking a cigarette, and\\n\\nthat he was still standing there when she heard the gunshot. And\\n\\nunlike in her interview where she said she heard Stroud say, “Damn,\\n\\nboy, you done f**ked up,” at trial she testified to hearing Stroud say,\\n\\nafter the gunshot, “damn man, I done f**ked up.” NeNe testified that\\n\\nshe did not see a gun, but when Stroud started walking to the car,\\n\\nshe saw that he had his shirt off and was wrapping his hand in the\\n\\nshirt. She could not see what was in his hand, but she said that\\n\\nStroud placed the wrapped shirt between his legs when he got back\\n\\ninto the car. And she testified that she never really saw Cade after\\n\\nthat, contrary to her statement in her interview that after the\\n\\ngunshot she saw Cade running away holding his arm.\\n\\n     The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Cade’s\\n\\nbody testified that it appeared that a single bullet entered and exited\\n\\n                                  11\\n his right arm, then re-entered his right torso where it struck several\\n\\nof his ribs, his right lung, and ultimately his heart, resulting in\\n\\nmassive hemorrhaging and death. The medical examiner did not,\\n\\nhowever, rule out the possibility that the wounds to the arm and the\\n\\ntorso could have been made by separate gunshots.\\n\\n      Additionally, the State played DVD recordings of two phone\\n\\ncalls Milton made at the jail shortly after his arrest. In the calls,\\n\\nMilton stated that he had been charged with murder and that he\\n\\nneeded to get the charge reduced to manslaughter.\\n\\n      2. Milton asserts that the evidence presented at trial was not\\n\\nsufficient for a rational trier of fact to find him guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt under Jackson v. Virginia.5 “Under [the Jackson]\\n\\ntest, we view all of the evidence presented at trial in the light most\\n\\n\\n      5 Although Milton purports to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\\n\\nas to all the charges of which the jury found him guilty, he was only sentenced\\non the charges of malice murder and possession of a firearm in the commission\\nof a felony. The other charges were either merged into his murder conviction\\nor vacated. Therefore, his challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to\\nsupport those crimes are moot, and we confine our analysis to the evidence\\npresented in support of malice murder and the firearm possession charge. See\\nAnderson v. State, \\n299 Ga. 193\\n, 196 (1) n.4 (\\n787 SE2d 202\\n) (2016) (defendant’s\\nclaims about sufficiency of evidence were moot for crimes that were vacated or\\nthat mergedr).\\n                                      12\\n favorable to the verdicts and consider whether any rational juror\\n\\ncould have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of\\n\\nthe crimes of which he was convicted.” Kirkland v. State, __ Ga. __,\\n\\n__ (8), \\n2024 WL 674830\\n, at *13 (Case No. S23A0942, decided Feb.\\n\\n20, 2024). See also Jackson, \\n443 U. S. at 319\\n (III) (B); Fitts v. State,\\n\\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 141 (3) (\\n859 SE2d 79\\n) (2021). “This limited review\\n\\nleaves to the jury the resolution of conflicts in the evidence, the\\n\\nweight of the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and reasonable\\n\\ninferences to be made from basic facts to ultimate facts.” Muse v.\\n\\nState, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n, 647 (2) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Milton was charged individually and as a party to the crime of\\n\\nmalice murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of\\n\\na crime. “A person commits the offense of murder when he\\n\\nunlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied,\\n\\ncauses the death of another human being.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (a). And\\n\\nunder OCGA §16-11-106 (b) (1), it is unlawful for any person to “have\\n\\non or within arm’s reach of his or her person a firearm . . . during\\n\\n                                  13\\n the commission of, or the attempt to commit . . . [a]ny crime against\\n\\nor involving the person of another.”\\n\\n      Moreover, “[e]very person concerned in the commission of a\\n\\ncrime is a party thereto and may be charged with and convicted of\\n\\ncommission of the crime.” OCGA § 16-2-20 (a). To obtain a conviction\\n\\nof a person as a party to the crime, the State must prove “that he\\n\\nintentionally aided or abetted in the commission of the crimes or\\n\\nintentionally advised, encouraged, counseled, or procured someone\\n\\nelse to commit the crimes.” Frazier v. State, \\n308 Ga. 450\\n, 453 (2) (a)\\n\\n(\\n841 SE2d 692\\n) (2020). “Conviction as a party to a crime requires\\n\\nproof of a common criminal intent, which the jury may infer from\\n\\nthe defendant’s presence, companionship, and conduct with another\\n\\nperpetrator before, during, and after the crimes.” Muse, 316 Ga. at\\n\\n648 (2) (citation and punctuation omitted). Thus, to prove Milton\\n\\nguilty of the charges of malice murder and possession of a firearm\\n\\nduring the commission of a felony, it was not necessary for the State\\n\\nto prove that Milton personally possessed a weapon or fired a gun at\\n\\nCade as long as the State proved that Milton was a party to the\\n\\n                                 14\\n crimes. See Scoggins v. State, \\n317 Ga. 832\\n, 836-39 (1) (a)-(b) (\\n896\\n\\nSE2d 476\\n) (2023) (even where evidence did not conclusively\\n\\nestablish which of the two defendants shot victim or had a weapon,\\n\\nevidence of a common criminal intent, including defendant’s\\n\\npresence, companionship, and conduct before and immediately after\\n\\nthe fatal shooting supported convictions as a party to the crimes of\\n\\nmalice murder and possession of a firearm).\\n\\n     Upon review of the record, we conclude the evidence at trial,\\n\\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, was\\n\\nconstitutionally sufficient to support Milton’s convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\nfelony. The State produced evidence that on the morning after Cade\\n\\nwas shot, NeNe told police that Milton shot Cade. Although NeNe\\n\\nsubsequently testified at trial that Stroud, rather than Milton, was\\n\\nthe shooter and that she originally identified Milton as the shooter\\n\\nonly because she felt pressured by police to do so, the jurors had the\\n\\nopportunity to review the portion of the video recording leading up\\n\\nto NeNe’s identification of Milton as the shooter, and it was up to\\n\\n                                 15\\n them to assess her credibility and decide which version to believe.\\n\\nSee Lewis v. State, \\n314 Ga. 654\\n, 659 (2) (\\n878 SE2d 467\\n) (2022) (where\\n\\nwitness provided conflicting testimony at trial about the events\\n\\nsurrounding the shooting and the identity of the shooter, it “was for\\n\\nthe jury to assess the credibility of the witnesses” and “to resolve\\n\\nany discrepancies in the evidence presented at trial.” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)).\\n\\n      Moreover, even if the jury had concluded that Stroud was the\\n\\nshooter, the evidence was sufficient to find Milton guilty as a party\\n\\nto the crime. NeNe initially told police that Stroud and Milton went\\n\\nlooking for Cade together after they had both argued with him and\\n\\nthat Stroud and Milton fought Cade together two-on-one after\\n\\nStroud said, “let’s go beat him up.” 6 Milton and Stroud also left the\\n\\nscene together in Stroud’s car after Cade was shot, and Cade’s blood\\n\\nwas found inside Stroud’s car. After his arrest, Milton lied to police\\n\\nabout what happened on the night of the shooting. Thus, the\\n\\n\\n      6Although NeNe testified at trial that they came upon Cade by chance\\n\\nand only Stroud fought Cade, it was for the jury to resolve this conflict. See\\nLewis, 314 Ga. at 659.\\n                                     16\\n evidence supported Milton’s presence and active participation\\n\\nbefore, during, and after the commission of the crimes.\\n\\n     We conclude that this and other evidence at trial was more\\n\\nthan sufficient to authorize the jury to find Milton guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt of the crimes of malice murder and possession of a\\n\\nfirearm during the commission of a crime, either as the shooter or\\n\\nas a party to the crimes.

ELEBY v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       BOGGS, Chief Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Lekievius Eleby challenges his 2012 convictions for\\n\\nfelony murder and other crimes in connection with a home invasion\\n\\nthat resulted in the death of Danavan Bussey 1 Appellant contends\\n\\n\\n       1 The crimes occurred on December 5, 2010. On March 16, 2011, a Lamar\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Appellant, Shameik Spinks, and Bryce Smith on\\nmultiple counts: Count 1—the felony murder of Bussey (armed robbery); Count\\n2—the felony murder of Bussey (aggravated assault); Count 3—armed robbery;\\nCount 4—burglary; Count 5—the aggravated assault of Holmes; Count 6—the\\naggravated assault of Johnson; Counts 7, 8, and 9—the false imprisonment of\\nBattle, Holmes, and Johnson; Count 10—conspiracy to commit armed robbery;\\nand Count 12—tampering with evidence. Appellant was separately indicted in\\nCount 13 for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and\\nSpinks was also separately indicted for the same offense. On January 5, 2012,\\nbefore trial, Bryce Smith pled guilty to robbery by intimidation and received\\na sentence of 15 years in prison, with 10 to serve, and testified against\\nAppellant at trial. On February 27, 2012, before trial, Spinks pled guilty to\\nfelony murder. He testified for the defense at trial. At a trial from February 27\\nto March 6, 2012, a jury found Appellant guilty on all counts of the indictment.\\n       On March 6, 2012, the trial court sentenced Appellant to life in prison\\nfor felony murder (armed robbery); to a concurrent sentence of life in prison for\\narmed robbery; to 15 consecutive years in prison for burglary; to 15 concurrent\\n that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his convictions\\n\\nbecause the identifications of Appellant as one of the participants\\n\\nwere not reliable; that the indictment was multiplicitous; that the\\n\\ntrial court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence of past\\n\\nrecollection recorded; that the trial court erred in failing to grant\\n\\nAppellant’s    motion     to   suppress     certain    pretrial   and    trial\\n\\nidentifications; that the trial court committed plain error when it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nyears in prison for the aggravated assaults of Holmes and Johnson; to 10\\nconcurrent years in prison on the three false imprisonment counts; to 10\\nconcurrent years in prison for conspiracy to commit armed robbery; to 10\\nconcurrent years in prison on the tampering count; and to five consecutive\\nyears in prison on the possession count. The trial court merged Count 2 for\\nsentencing purposes. On March 19, 2012, Appellant filed a motion for new trial,\\nwhich he amended through new counsel on March 16, 2020. On August 2, 2023,\\nthe trial court denied the motion for new trial, as amended. Appellant filed a\\ntimely notice of appeal, and the case was docketed in this Court for the term\\nbeginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n      We note that there was a significant delay between the filing of\\nAppellant’s motion for new trial in 2012 and the filing of his amended motion\\nin 2020. See Everett v. State, 899 SE2d 699, 700 n.2 (Ga. 2024) (stating that\\n“[w]e are troubled by the inordinate and unexplained delay between the filing\\nof Everett’s motion for new trial in 2010 and the filing of an amended motion\\n12 years later”). Here, Appellant was appointed new counsel in 2013, but no\\nsubstantive filings by that counsel appear in the record. In August 2019,\\nAppellant retained current appellate counsel, who filed the amended motion\\nfor new trial in 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      2\\n allowed a GBI agent to give her opinion about the meaning of certain\\n\\ntext messages; that Appellant’s sentences for the aggravated\\n\\nassaults of Holmes and Johnson should have merged with each other\\n\\nor with the armed robbery offense; that the conspiracy to commit\\n\\narmed robbery should have merged with the conviction for armed\\n\\nrobbery; that the possession offense should have been merged with\\n\\nfelony murder; that the prosecutor made improper and prejudicial\\n\\ncomments in his closing argument; and that his trial counsel was\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective for failing to make certain objections at\\n\\ntrial. For the reasons that follow, we vacate Appellant’s convictions\\n\\nand sentences for armed robbery and conspiracy to commit armed\\n\\nrobbery. Appellant’s remaining claims are not preserved for appeal,\\n\\nare without merit, or do not require reversal.\\n\\n     1. The evidence presented at trial showed that the victims—\\n\\nBussey, Holmes, and Johnson—were friends who attended Gordon\\n\\nCollege together and lived in a house on Westchester Drive in\\n\\nBarnesville in December 2010. Appellant also lived on Westchester\\n\\nDrive. Johnson testified that he knew Appellant from “hanging\\n\\n                                  3\\n around Barnesville” and that, although he did not “hang out” with\\n\\nShameik Spinks, 2 he had “seen him around.” Likewise, Holmes\\n\\ntestified that he had met Appellant at a club, had seen him around\\n\\nGordon College and also knew him from the Westchester Drive\\n\\nneighborhood, but that, at the time of the crimes, he did not know\\n\\nhis last name.\\n\\n     Before the crimes, there had been animosity between the\\n\\nvictims and Appellant, with the victims thinking that Appellant had\\n\\ntwice broken into their home. In September 2010, Bussey, who was\\n\\nwith Johnson, confronted Appellant, who was with his cousin\\n\\nSpinks, about the break-ins. According to Johnson, this led to a fight\\n\\nbetween Bussey and Appellant, with Spinks also “trying to jump on\\n\\n[Bussey].” Johnson added that Bussey and Appellant threw some\\n\\npunches at each other and the fight “just ended.” In addition, on the\\n\\nnight of December 4, 2010, one night before the crimes at issue here,\\n\\nwhen the victims were driving down Westchester Drive, they saw\\n\\n\\n\\n     2 Appellant testified that Spinks’s “granddaddy and my father are first\\n\\ncousins” and Johnson and Holmes referred to Spinks as Appellant’s cousin.\\n                                     4\\n Spinks walking down the street, pulled up next to him, and “had a\\n\\ncouple of words with him.” Holmes testified that he asked Spinks\\n\\nabout the fight with Bussey and that Spinks replied that he was “not\\n\\ngoing to fight,” “I’m going to shoot.” The victims drove away.\\n\\n     In the early morning hours of December 5, 2010, the victims\\n\\nwere having a party at which a few other people, including Diamond\\n\\nRhodes and Keitrae Battle, were present. Rhodes and Bussey were\\n\\nfriends, having met at Gordon College, and Battle knew Bussey\\n\\nthrough a mutual friend. Rhodes and Battle both testified that they\\n\\nregularly socialized at Bussey’s house. At trial, Johnson testified\\n\\nthat he heard a knock on the door and opened it. He testified that\\n\\n“all [he] remembered [wa]s a gun in [his] face and they came in.”\\n\\nWhen asked “how many people came in,” Johnson said, “[i]t was\\n\\nthree guys. One stood at the door. Lekievius and Shameik, they\\n\\ncame in.” Johnson added that he recognized Appellant and Spinks\\n\\neven though they had their faces partially covered from the mouth\\n\\ndown. Appellant was armed with a handgun, and Spinks was armed\\n\\nwith a shotgun. When Appellant and Spinks came into the house,\\n\\n                                  5\\n “they asked for money and whatever was valuable.” According to\\n\\nJohnson, Appellant went to the living room where Holmes was\\n\\nsitting and had him bend over a table. Bussey then came from the\\n\\nback of the house and tried to talk to the intruders. Bussey\\n\\napproached Spinks and attempted to take the shotgun from him.\\n\\nThe two men struggled for it, then “a shot [went] off,” and Bussey\\n\\nfell to the floor. After the shot was fired, Appellant and Spinks “were\\n\\nstill demanding . . . stuff.” Spinks took Johnson to Bussey’s room and\\n\\nAppellant took Holmes to Johnson’s room. Johnson found Rhodes’s\\n\\nhandbag in Bussey’s room and gave it to Spinks. Shortly after that,\\n\\nAppellant and Spinks left. At trial, although Johnson identified\\n\\nAppellant as one of the intruders in the house that night, he\\n\\nacknowledged that, when he was first interviewed by the police, he\\n\\ndid not say that Appellant was present during the crimes. According\\n\\nto Johnson, at the time of the interview, he had “just witnessed the\\n\\nmurder of my best friend,” and “my mind was elsewhere.” Johnson\\n\\ntestified that the crimes lasted five to ten minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  6\\n      Holmes’s testimony tracked that of Johnson, and he added that\\n\\nAppellant came into the house with his hoodie pulled up to his\\n\\nmouth but that Appellant let his hoodie slip down, allowing Holmes\\n\\nto see his entire face. Holmes added that the other person had a\\n\\nbandanna covering his mouth but not the rest of his face and that\\n\\nhe recognized that person as Spinks. According to Holmes,\\n\\nAppellant was carrying a revolver, and Spinks had a shotgun.\\n\\nHolmes also acknowledged that, in an interview with the police, he\\n\\nwas shown a photograph only of Appellant, but added that the\\n\\nphotograph “just confirmed [Appellant’s] name” and did not “suggest\\n\\nto [him] that that night it was Lekievius.”\\n\\n     When Battle heard intruders come into the house, she hid in\\n\\nthe bathtub. However, once she heard shots, she tried to exit the\\n\\nhouse through the front door but was stopped by one of the intruders\\n\\nand stayed near the front door until she saw the three intruders exit\\n\\nthe house and walk around the left side of it.\\n\\n     According to Smith, who lived in the neighborhood, he,\\n\\nAppellant, Spinks, and some other people were at the home of\\n\\n                                  7\\n Ardrana Pate on the night of the crimes. Smith added that he had\\n\\nbeen friends with Appellant since he “was young”; that he had\\n\\nknown Spinks since the summer of 2010; and that he had met\\n\\nBussey “through [Appellant].” Smith added that he left Pate’s house\\n\\nbetween midnight and 1:00 a.m. and that Spinks later texted him,\\n\\nasking him “to hit a lick,” which Smith said meant to commit a\\n\\nrobbery. Smith agreed and went outside his house to smoke a\\n\\ncigarette. He then saw Spinks and Appellant “coming down,” with\\n\\nAppellant carrying a handgun and Spinks carrying a shotgun.\\n\\nSmith, who testified that he did not have a weapon, “jumped off\\n\\n[his] porch” and the men “ran over to the [victims’] house.”\\n\\nAccording to Smith, Appellant and Spinks knocked on the door, and\\n\\nwhen someone answered, Appellant and Spinks went into the house.\\n\\nSmith heard Bussey trying to “calm everything down,” but, he\\n\\nadded, “they started tussling.” Smith then heard two shots; “[t]he\\n\\nfirst one was kind of loud, but the second one was very loud.” Smith\\n\\ndid not see who was shot, and he then ran to his driveway, from\\n\\nwhere he saw Appellant and Spinks running. He saw Appellant and\\n\\n                                 8\\n Spinks go by a neighbor’s house, and “then [he] saw a person throw\\n\\na   shotgun    over   the   fence.”       On   cross-examination,   Smith\\n\\nacknowledged that he had given “different versions” of the events of\\n\\nthat night in interviews with law enforcement officials. Among other\\n\\nversions, Smith told officers that he thought Spinks and Appellant\\n\\nwere the perpetrators, but that it was just a “guess” and that he was\\n\\nhome in his kitchen when he heard gunshots; that Spinks,\\n\\nAppellant, and a man named Kellius Collier committed the crimes\\n\\nand that he was at home and saw “the whole thing out of [his]\\n\\nwindow”; that he was on his porch when he saw Spinks, Appellant,\\n\\nand an unspecified third person commit the crimes; that he did not\\n\\nknow anything about the crimes; and that he participated in the\\n\\ncrimes by standing in the doorway of the victims’ house. Smith\\n\\ntestified that he had given these different versions because “[he] was\\n\\nscared. It was [his] first time ever [to] be in trouble.”\\n\\n     Ardrana Pate, who lived near the victims’ home, testified that\\n\\nshe knew Smith and Appellant and had met Spinks. She also knew\\n\\nthe victims. Pate testified that on the night of December 4-5, 2010,\\n\\n                                      9\\n Appellant, Spinks, Smith, and Ashley Parker came to her house.\\n\\nSmith was the last to arrive, shortly after midnight. She added that\\n\\nshe overheard the group “jokingly saying that [it] would be a sweet\\n\\nlick” to rob the victims’ home and that Appellant asked Spinks to let\\n\\nhim “see the piece.” According to Pate, Spinks had a small backpack\\n\\nand Appellant “thought that the gun was in it and it actually wasn’t.\\n\\n[Spinks] said . . . [he] moved it.” She added that they left her house\\n\\nabout 1:30 to 1:45 a.m. on December 5. Similarly, Ashley Parker,\\n\\nwho knew Appellant, Smith, and Spinks, testified that she was at\\n\\nPate’s house with the three men and then went to Appellant’s home,\\n\\nleaving Appellant’s house at about 1:45 a.m.\\n\\n     Immediately after the shooting, an occupant of Bussey’s house\\n\\ncalled 911, and law enforcement officials arrived at the crime scene\\n\\naround 3:52 a.m. Bussey had been shot once in the leg with the\\n\\nhandgun and once to the right side of his face with the shotgun. The\\n\\nshotgun wound was fatal. Law enforcement officers subsequently\\n\\nrecovered a pump shotgun from the backyard of a home on\\n\\nWestchester Drive. A GBI firearms examiner determined that a\\n\\n                                 10\\n shotgun shell found at the crime scene was fired from that shotgun.\\n\\nAlthough a .22-caliber bullet was recovered from Bussey’s leg, the\\n\\nhandgun used in the crimes was never recovered.\\n\\n     GBI Agent Cayce Ingalls testified about text messages that\\n\\nAppellant and Spinks sent to each other from December 4 to 5, 2010.\\n\\nFor example, at 4:37 p.m. on December 4, Spinks sent Appellant a\\n\\ntext message saying that he would “be over” and that he had “the 22\\n\\nand the 22 bullets and the pump shells.” At 7:43 p.m. on December\\n\\n4, Appellant received a text message from Spinks saying that\\n\\n“n***** just pulled up on me. Then I start poppin and they got scared\\n\\nLOL they was just like tell [Appellant] it’s on site and I was like then\\n\\nit’s on. . . . They bi**hes LOL you wanna kill these n*****.”\\n\\n     In the meantime, from December 4 to 5, Spinks was texting a\\n\\nperson named Marquevus Smith. At 9:00 a.m. on December 4,\\n\\nSpinks asked Marquevus if he had “the pump shells I gotta hit the\\n\\nbig lick . . . today,” and at 2:00 p.m. on December 4, Spinks asked\\n\\nMarquevus if he had “the 22.” Marquevus responded that he had the\\n\\npump shells, and with regard to Spinks’s question about the “22,”\\n\\n                                  11\\n Marquevus told Spinks to “stop texting nonsense my n**** text\\n\\nmessages get tracked.” Around 6:00 p.m. on December 4, Spinks\\n\\ndirected Marquevus to leave “the pump and the 22” under the porch\\n\\nof Spinks’s aunt. In text messages around 1:40 to 1:55 a.m. on\\n\\nDecember 5, Spinks told Marquevus that he “might have to come hit\\n\\nthis lick”; that this was the “best time” to hit “them college n*****\\n\\ndown there in the house with some hoes”; rob “them soft ass college\\n\\nboys . . . is a sweet lick ‘cause they gonna show us where everything\\n\\nat”; and that “them hoes gonna be quiet cause they gonna be scared\\n\\nto get shot.” Marquevus, however, declined to participate, saying\\n\\nthat the college girls would be “snitching” and he knew that “all of\\n\\nthem . . . got cell phones.”\\n\\n     The State also offered evidence that Spinks texted Smith at\\n\\n1:55 a.m. on December 5, asking him if he “want[ed] to hit a lick.”\\n\\nSmith asked, “where about and what’s it worth.” Spinks replied that\\n\\n“it’s the college boys,” and Smith said that he lived “right by” them,\\n\\nthat he watched them, that there “ain’t none in there worth all that.”\\n\\nSmith added that they should “wait ‘til [they were] gone.” Spinks\\n\\n                                 12\\n replied that they would get nothing “when they gone,” and Smith\\n\\nasked Spinks if he was at Appellant’s house. Spinks replied that he\\n\\nwas, and at 2:13 a.m., Smith texted Spinks that he would “be up\\n\\nthere when [he] g[o]t back from” a friend’s house. At 2:37 a.m.,\\n\\nSpinks texted Smith “where you at cause we left Kevius’s house. He\\n\\nwent to sleep.”\\n\\n     Agent Ingalls and Lieutenant Al Moltrum of the Barnesville\\n\\nPolice Department interviewed Appellant at 8:37 a.m. on December\\n\\n5, as well as at 2:39 p.m. that same day. In the first interview,\\n\\nAppellant denied committing the crimes, saying that he did not “go\\n\\nto [the victims’ home] last night,” that he “ain’t went down there and\\n\\nshot nobody,” and that “[i]f them boys saying I was at they house,”\\n\\nthey were lying, “[p]robably ‘cause they don’t like me.” He also\\n\\ndenied being with Spinks on the night of December 4-5, adding that\\n\\nhe was home by 10:45 p.m., got into the bed that he shared with his\\n\\nlittle brother, and went to sleep. In the second interview, law\\n\\nenforcement officials informed Appellant that they had learned,\\n\\ncontrary to Appellant’s statements during his first interview, that\\n\\n                                 13\\n Spinks was with him on the night of the crimes. Appellant continued\\n\\nto deny his involvement in the crimes, saying that he was home in\\n\\nbed. Appellant, however, did say that Spinks texted him on the night\\n\\nof December 4 and told him about his argument with Bussey and his\\n\\nfriends that night. According to Appellant, Spinks said that he was\\n\\n“going to get them.” Appellant told Spinks to “stay out of their way.”\\n\\nLieutenant Moltrum told Appellant that Pate had told the officers\\n\\nthat Spinks and Appellant were at her house around 2:00 a.m. on\\n\\nDecember 5 and that Appellant had gotten himself into trouble in\\n\\nthe first interview in saying that he had gone to sleep around\\n\\n“midnight.” Appellant said that Pate was “lying” and that it was\\n\\n“probably later than that” when he went to sleep. Similarly, when\\n\\nLieutenant Moltrum informed Appellant that Spinks had said that\\n\\nAppellant was with Spinks “the whole time,” Appellant said that\\n\\nSpinks was lying.\\n\\n     Appellant and Spinks testified in Appellant’s defense at trial.\\n\\nSpinks testified that Appellant did not plan or take part in the\\n\\nrobbery. According to Spinks, the last time he saw Appellant on the\\n\\n                                 14\\n night of the crimes, Appellant “said he was going to go to sleep.” He\\n\\nadded that, during his plea hearing, he told the trial court that, if\\n\\nAppellant were convicted, the “court would be convicting an\\n\\ninnocent man.” He further testified that he, Smith, and “some dude\\n\\n[Smith] brought named Pooh” committed the crimes.\\n\\n     Appellant testified that he lived on Westchester Drive with his\\n\\nmother, father, little brother, and sister, where he shared a bedroom\\n\\nwith his little brother, who is six years old. He added that he knew\\n\\nSmith, who lived down the street from him, and that he had known\\n\\nSpinks since August 2010. With regard to Spinks’s text at 4:37 p.m.\\n\\non December 4, Appellant said that he thought that Spinks was\\n\\nsimply saying that “he was happy that he had a gun.” Appellant\\n\\nadded that he saw Spinks about 8:30 that night at a friend’s house\\n\\nand that Spinks had a book bag with him with a .22-caliber revolver\\n\\ninside of it. Appellant left the friend’s house and went home.\\n\\nHowever, after midnight on December 5, he went with Spinks and\\n\\nParker to Pate’s house. After leaving Pate’s house, Appellant,\\n\\nSpinks, and Parker went to Appellant’s house, where they drank\\n\\n                                 15\\n and watched television in the garage. According to Appellant, he\\n\\nsubsequently went to bed, and Spinks and Parker left his house.\\n\\nAppellant then called his girlfriend and then went to sleep.\\n\\nAppellant testified that he was not “involved in any way with the\\n\\nrobbery of” Bussey and his friends. On cross-examination, Appellant\\n\\nacknowledged that he told the police on the morning of December 5\\n\\nthat he had not seen Spinks on the night of December 4 to 5 and did\\n\\nnot know where Spinks was.\\n\\n     Cell phone records showed that Appellant spoke with his\\n\\ngirlfriend for about 45 minutes beginning at 2:26 a.m. on December\\n\\n5. Appellant’s girlfriend testified that, during this conversation, she\\n\\nheard Appellant tell his little brother to “scoot over in the bed.” She\\n\\nadded that she did not hear any background noise during the\\n\\nconversation and that Appellant did not mention anything about\\n\\nplanning a robbery. According to Appellant’s girlfriend, Appellant\\n\\nfell asleep several times during their conversation. She also testified\\n\\nthat Appellant called her back at 4:06 a.m. that same morning and\\n\\ntold her that someone in the neighborhood had been shot. Appellant\\n\\n                                  16\\n “sounded like he had just [woken] up, like he had been asleep.”\\n\\nAccording to Appellant’s girlfriend, he did not appear to be out of\\n\\nbreath or “sound as though he had been running.”\\n\\n     1. Appellant claims that the evidence is insufficient to support\\n\\nhis convictions because he was not “competently identified” as one\\n\\nof the assailants. However, the evidence establishing Appellant’s\\n\\nidentification as a participant in the crimes was sufficient. That\\n\\nevidence included testimony from a co-indictee and two victims that\\n\\nAppellant entered the victims’ house with a handgun and\\n\\nparticipated in the crimes committed therein. It also included\\n\\nevidence that contradicted the version of events that Appellant\\n\\ninitially gave to law enforcement officials regarding his activities on\\n\\nthe night of the crimes. This evidence, viewed in the light most\\n\\nfavorable to the verdicts, was clearly sufficient as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process to authorize a rational jury to conclude\\n\\nthat Appellant participated in the crimes committed at the victims’\\n\\nhouse. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (99 SCt 2781, 61\\n\\nLE2d 560) (1979); Ward v. State, 316 Ga. 295, 298 (888 SE2d 75)\\n\\n                                  17\\n (2023) (explaining that “the testimony of a single witness is\\n\\ngenerally sufficient to establish a fact” (cleaned up)). Although\\n\\nAppellant claims that the identifications of him were not reliable, it\\n\\nwas for the jury to resolve “conflicts or inconsistencies in the\\n\\nevidence, credibility of witnesses, and reasonable inferences to be\\n\\nderived from the facts.” Graham v. State, 313 Ga. 436, 440 (870 SE2d\\n\\n424) (2022) (cleaned up).\\n\\n     2. Relying solely on the non-binding, solo concurrence by\\n\\nJustice Stevens in Ball v. United States, 470 U.S. 856, 867-868 (105\\n\\nSCt 1668, 84 LE2d 740) (1985), Appellant argues that double\\n\\njeopardy concerns prohibited his prosecution on the multi-count or\\n\\n“multiplicitous” indictment in this case. This claim, however, is\\n\\nwithout merit. First, the majority in Ball explained that “even where\\n\\nthe [Double Jeopardy] Clause bars cumulative punishment for a\\n\\ngroup of offenses, the Clause does not prohibit the State from\\n\\nprosecuting the defendant for such multiple offenses in a single\\n\\nprosecution.” Id. at 860 n.7 (cleaned up). Similarly, we have held\\n\\nthat the “procedural protections against double jeopardy apply only\\n\\n                                 18\\n to   ‘multiple    prosecutions,’     meaning      multiple     or   successive\\n\\nindictments or criminal proceedings” and “do not apply to a single\\n\\nindictment that contains multiple counts.” Williams v. State, 307\\n\\nGa. 778, 779 (838 SE2d 235) (2020) (cleaned up). For these reasons,\\n\\nthis claim fails.3\\n\\n      3.   Appellant contends that the trial court erred in not\\n\\npermitting the jury to have access to a transcript of an interview of\\n\\nJohnson by law enforcement officials as a past recollection\\n\\nrecorded. 4 However, at trial, Appellant contended only that the jury\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 As part of his argument in the enumeration concerning the indictment,\\n\\nAppellant raises an issue about the trial court’s response to a jury question.\\nDuring its deliberations, the jury asked the trial court whether, with regard to\\nthe tampering with evidence count of the indictment, the State had to prove\\nthat Appellant “was the one who physically had possession of the shotgun and\\nwas the one who disposed of the weapon.” The trial court answered “no” to this\\njury question, and Appellant contends that the answer was an abuse of\\ndiscretion. However, Appellant affirmatively waived this issue by agreeing\\nthat the correct answer to the jury’s question was “no.” See Hughes v. State,\\n310 Ga. 453, 457 (851 SE2d 580) (2020) (appellant affirmatively waived any\\nerror in answering the jury’s questions on the issue of proximate cause when\\nhe “agreed that re-reading the indictment was the appropriate means to\\nanswer the jury’s questions”).\\n\\n      4 Appellant contended that the transcript should either be read to the\\n\\njury or given to them to review in the jury box. He did not seek to have the jury\\ntake the transcript to the jury room. The transcript of Johnson’s interview was\\nnot introduced into evidence at trial.\\n                                       19\\n should have access to a short written statement that Johnson gave\\n\\nto the police, not that the jury should be given access to the\\n\\ntranscript of Johnson’s interview. There is therefore no ruling by the\\n\\ntrial court on an evidentiary issue regarding the transcript of\\n\\nJohnson’s interview. Because this case was tried in 2012 under our\\n\\nformer Evidence Code, plain error review of the evidentiary claim\\n\\nthat the trial court erred in not granting the jury access to the\\n\\ntranscript of Johnson’s interview is not available. See Pyatt v. State,\\n\\n298 Ga. 742, 746 n.7 (784 SE2d 759) (2016) (explaining that plain\\n\\nerror review under our current Evidence Code “applies only to any\\n\\nmotion made or hearing or trial commenced on or after January 1,\\n\\n2013” (cleaned up)). Moreover, under the former Evidence Code,\\n\\nbecause Appellant did not seek at trial to have the jury be given\\n\\naccess to the transcript of the interview, any error in denying his\\n\\nrequest to give the jury access to it is not preserved for appeal. See\\n\\nRucker v. State, 293 Ga. 116, 121-122 (744 SE2d 36) (2013) (holding,\\n\\nin a case under the former Evidence Code, that a claim that the trial\\n\\ncourt erred in not permitting the introduction of certain evidence\\n\\n                                  20\\n was not preserved for review because the defendant did not seek to\\n\\nintroduce the evidence during trial).\\n\\n      4. Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\nmotion to suppress the pretrial and trial identifications by Johnson,\\n\\nHolmes, and Smith. More specifically, Appellant contends that the\\n\\nidentifications were the result of impermissibly suggestive\\n\\nprocedures and thus violated his right to due process. We conclude\\n\\nthat these claims fail. 5\\n\\n      (a) First, Appellant raised no objection at trial to Smith’s\\n\\nidentification of Appellant as one of the perpetrators. Appellant’s\\n\\nchallenge to Smith’s testimony is therefore not preserved for review.\\n\\nSee Lane v. State, 312 Ga. 619, 622 (864 SE2d 34) (2021) (explaining\\n\\nthat “in the absence of a timely objection, there is no appellate\\n\\nreview of evidentiary rulings under the old Evidence Code” (cleaned\\n\\n\\n      5 We note that, with the adoption of OCGA §§ 17-20-1 through 17-20-3,\\n\\n“the Georgia General Assembly has prioritized improving the accuracy of\\neyewitness identifications.” Curry v. State, 305 Ga. 73, 76 n.3 (823 SE2d 758)\\n(2019). These provisions, however, did not become effective until July 1, 2016,\\nafter the trial of this case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      21\\n up)).\\n\\n        (b)   Appellant     sought     to    suppress    Johnson’s     in-court\\n\\nidentification of him on the ground that Johnson’s identification was\\n\\nthe result of an impermissibly suggestive process because Holmes\\n\\ntold Johnson that Appellant was one of the gunmen. 6 In this regard,\\n\\nat trial, when Johnson was asked on cross-examination whether he\\n\\nremembered telling law enforcement officials during his second\\n\\ninterview that Holmes told him that Appellant was the “guy” behind\\n\\nSpinks during the crimes, Johnson testified, “yeah, he told me. We\\n\\ntalked about it. . . . But he didn’t say, like—you know, it wasn’t no,\\n\\nlike, I didn’t know who it was.” However, the due process principles\\n\\non which Appellant relies, as explained by such cases as Neil v.\\n\\nBiggers, 409 U.S. 188 (93 SCt 375, 34 LE2d 401) (1972), and\\n\\nSimmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (88 SCt 967, 19 LE2d\\n\\n1247) (1968), apply only when the suggestive circumstances leading\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        6 At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Johnson testified that he was\\n\\nnever shown any lineup by law enforcement officials. «T4. 114-115» No other\\nevidence was offered on this point. In addition, there was no evidence offered\\nat trial of any pretrial identification of Appellant by Johnson.\\n                                        22\\n to an identification are arranged or orchestrated by law enforcement\\n\\nofficials.

State, 307 Ga. 444, 449\\n\\n(836 SE2d 92) (2019) (quoting the foregoing principles from Perry).\\n\\nSee also Clay v. State, 309 Ga. 593, 598 (847 SE2d 530) (2020)\\n\\n(holding that, where a witness identified the defendant in a photo\\n\\n                                   23\\n array after seeing a news report of the defendant’s arrest, the\\n\\ndefendant could not challenge the witness’s identification based on\\n\\nthe foregoing due process principles because the defendant was not\\n\\n“challenging the identification procedure used by law enforcement,\\n\\nbut, instead, is challenging the weight and credibility of [the\\n\\nwitness’s] identification,” matters that were reserved for the jury).\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not\\n\\nerr   in    denying   Appellant’s    motion      to   suppress    Johnson’s\\n\\nidentification testimony.\\n\\n      (c)   In   contrast,   Appellant’s   claim      regarding   Holmes’s\\n\\nidentification testimony implicates due process concerns because the\\n\\nrecord shows that, at Holmes’s interview with law enforcement\\n\\nofficials on the morning of the crimes, he identified Appellant as\\n\\nbeing involved in the crimes after law enforcement officials showed\\n\\nHolmes a single photo of Appellant.\\n\\n      “If   an   out-of-court   identification    by a    witness    is   so\\n\\nimpermissibly suggestive that it could result in a substantial\\n\\nlikelihood of misidentification, evidence of that out-of-court\\n\\n                                    24\\n identification violates due process and is inadmissible at trial.”\\n\\nLewis v.

(cleaned up). “Second, if a trial court properly concludes\\n\\nthat the State employed an impermissibly suggestive pre-trial\\n\\nidentification procedure, the issue becomes whether, considering the\\n\\ntotality of the circumstances, there was a substantial likelihood of\\n\\nirreparable misidentification.” Id. (cleaned up). If there is not a\\n\\nsubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, “then both\\n\\nthe pre-trial and in-court identifications are admissible.” Curry v.\\n\\nState, 305 Ga. 73, 76 (823 SE2d 758) (2019) (cleaned up). We\\n\\nconsider the “totality of the circumstances” in determining whether\\n\\n                                   25\\n there is a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. See\\n\\nHoward v. State, ___ Ga. ___, ___ (899 SE2d 669, 677) (2024).\\n\\n      Factors to consider include (1) a witness’s opportunity to\\n      view the accused at the time of the crime; (2) the witness’s\\n      degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness’s prior\\n      description of the accused; (4) the witness’s level of\\n      certainty at the confrontation; and (5) the length of time\\n      between the crime and the confrontation.\\n\\nId. 7 “Moreover, whether the witness knows the defendant is a\\n\\ncritical factor in determining the reliability of an identification.”\\n\\n\\n      7 In two recent cases, we have noted that there is tension between the\\n\\n“level-of-certainty” aspect of the due process test for determining the likelihood\\nof misidentification and our holding in Brodes v. State, 279 Ga. 435 (614 SE2d\\n766) (2005), that trial courts should “refrain from informing jurors [that] they\\nmay consider a witness’s level of certainty when instructing them on the\\nfactors that may be considered in deciding the reliability of that identification.”\\nId. at 442. See State v. Harris, 316 Ga. 272, 281 n.12 (888 SE2d 50) (2023);\\nPearson v. State, 311 Ga. 26, 29 n.5 (855 SE2d 606) (2021). In Harris, we\\nexplained that\\n\\n      [w]hile it seems incompatible that a trial judge should consider the\\n      witness’s level of certainty when determining the likelihood of\\n      misidentification but the jury may not be instructed to consider the\\n      witness’s level of certainty when determining the reliability of the\\n      identification, no one has asked us to reconsider our decision in\\n      Brodes, and the trial court’s consideration of this factor is expressly\\n      sanctioned under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, see Neil v.\\n      Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199 (93 SCt 375, 34 LE2d 401) (1972).\\n\\n316 Ga. at 281 n.12.\\n\\n\\n                                        26\\n Lewis, 314 Ga. at 670 (cleaned up). “We review a trial court’s ruling\\n\\non a motion to suppress identification evidence for an abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion,” State v. Harris, 316 Ga. 272, 280 (888 SE2d 50) (2023),\\n\\nand in reviewing a ruling on such a motion, “evidence is construed\\n\\nmost favorably to uphold the findings and judgment and the trial\\n\\ncourt’s findings on disputed facts and credibility must be accepted\\n\\nunless clearly erroneous.” Wright v. State, 294 Ga. 798, 801 (756\\n\\nSE2d 513) (2014) (cleaned up). Finally, “in determining whether the\\n\\ntrial court erred in denying the motion to suppress identification\\n\\ntestimony, this court may consider the evidence adduced both at the\\n\\nsuppression hearing and at trial.” Id. at 802 (cleaned up).\\n\\n     At trial, Lieutenant Moltrum and Agent Ingalls testified that\\n\\nthey conducted an interview with Holmes at 6:11 a.m. on December\\n\\n5, about two hours after the crimes. They added that Holmes\\n\\nidentified a man he referred to as “Kevian’s cousin” as being the\\n\\nperpetrator with the shotgun, but that Holmes said “not really”\\n\\nwhen asked if he could identify the second perpetrator who entered\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 27\\n the house with a handgun. 8 Because Lieutenant Moltrum had heard\\n\\nofficers at the crime scene discussing names like “Lekievius Collier,”\\n\\n“Kevius,” and “Lekievius Eleby,” and because Lieutenant Moltrum\\n\\nknew a “Kelius Collier,” as well as Appellant, he asked Holmes about\\n\\n“Kevian,” such as where he lived. Lieutenant Moltrum asked\\n\\nHolmes if “Kevian” lived three or four houses away from the victims,\\n\\nand Holmes said that he did. Lieutenant Moltrum knew that\\n\\nAppellant lived at that location, and he showed Holmes a copy of\\n\\nAppellant’s driver’s license. Holmes recognized the picture on the\\n\\ndriver’s license and identified the person depicted as “Kevian” and\\n\\nsaid that he was the second intruder. The trial court did not address\\n\\nwhether the use of a single photo for identification was\\n\\nimpermissibly suggestive, but skipped to the second part of the due\\n\\nprocess test, ruling that there was not a substantial likelihood of\\n\\nirreparable misidentification. We conclude that, even assuming that\\n\\nshowing Holmes the driver’s license photograph was impermissibly\\n\\n\\n      8 At the pretrial hearing and at trial, Holmes denied that he initially said\\n\\nthat he could identify the second intruder.\\n\\n                                       28\\n suggestive, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that\\n\\nthere   was     not     a   substantial     likelihood    of     irreparable\\n\\nmisidentification.\\n\\n     Here, the evidence indicates that the likelihood of irreparable\\n\\nmisidentification was low. Holmes had an ample opportunity to view\\n\\nthe perpetrator at the crime scene. In this regard, Holmes testified\\n\\nthat, at the time of the crimes, a light was on that “really shined into\\n\\nthe living room” where he was sitting when the intruders came into\\n\\nthe house. Holmes added that he was close enough to touch\\n\\nAppellant     and     Spinks   during     the   crimes,   that    Appellant\\n\\naccompanied Holmes to Johnson’s bedroom to look for items to take,\\n\\nand that the crimes lasted about seven minutes. Moreover, Holmes\\n\\nhad become personally acquainted with Appellant before the crimes\\n\\nand testified that, during the crimes, he was able to see Appellant’s\\n\\nface and recognized his voice when Appellant spoke. In addition,\\n\\nHolmes testified that, during the crimes, he was “paying attention”\\n\\nto the people at the door and to the “people who took me to the back”\\n\\nof the house, and he remained certain in his identification of\\n\\n                                   29\\n Appellant as being one of the assailants. Holmes also testified that\\n\\nbeing shown the photograph of Appellant did not change his “mind\\n\\nin anyway [sic],” as he knew from the crime scene “who had come in\\n\\nthe house.” Finally, there was only a very short time—about two\\n\\nhours—between the time that Holmes saw Appellant during the\\n\\ncrimes and the identification. Considering the totality of the\\n\\ncircumstances, we conclude that, even though Holmes failed to\\n\\ninitially identify Appellant when speaking to law enforcement\\n\\nofficials, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the\\n\\npresentation of a single photo to Holmes did not create a substantial\\n\\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification. See Howard, ___ Ga. at\\n\\n___ (899 SE2d at 677-678) (holding that an initial photo array that\\n\\nwe assumed was impermissibly suggestive did not lead to\\n\\nsubstantial likelihood of misidentification even where a witness who\\n\\nhad not met the defendant before the day of the shooting and who\\n\\nwas uncertain in identifying the defendant in the initial photo array\\n\\nhad “a significant opportunity to view [the defendant] before and\\n\\nduring the shooting” and identified the defendant with certainty in\\n\\n                                   30\\n a second photo array); Harris, 316 Ga. at 281 (explaining that “if the\\n\\nwitness was acquainted or otherwise personally familiar with the\\n\\nsuspect before making an out-of-court identification, then there is\\n\\nnot a substantial likelihood of misidentification regardless of an\\n\\nimpermissibly suggestive procedure” (cleaned up)); Pearson v. State,\\n\\n311 Ga. 26, 30 (855 SE2d 606) (2021) (holding that there was no\\n\\nsubstantial likelihood of misidentification where the witnesses had\\n\\na good opportunity to view the perpetrator during the crime, “paid\\n\\nattention to him at that time,” expressed certainty in their\\n\\nidentifications, and the showup occurred shortly after the crimes);\\n\\nWright, 294 Ga. at 800, 802-803 (rejecting argument that a witness’s\\n\\nin-court identification should have been excluded for substantial\\n\\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification where the witness was\\n\\nunable to select defendant definitively from a photo array but\\n\\ntestified that his later identification “was based on remembering\\n\\n[the defendant] from the scene of the crime”).\\n\\n     5. Appellant contends that the trial court committed plain\\n\\nerror when it allowed Agent Ingalls to testify about her\\n\\n                                 31\\n understanding of the meaning of various text messages introduced\\n\\ninto evidence. However, because this case was tried under our\\n\\nformer Evidence Code, plain error review of this evidentiary claim\\n\\nis not available. See Lane, 312 Ga. at 622. Moreover, under our\\n\\nformer Evidence Code, the claim is not preserved for review because\\n\\nAppellant did not object to the testimony in question. See Id.\\n\\n(explaining that under the former Evidence Code, “in the absence of\\n\\na timely objection, there is no appellate review of evidentiary\\n\\nrulings”).\\n\\n     6. Appellant contends that the trial court made several errors\\n\\nin sentencing him. We agree with one of Appellant’s claims, and we\\n\\nhave identified one merger error in Appellant’s sentencing that\\n\\nrequires correction.\\n\\n     Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to merge\\n\\nthe aggravated assaults of Holmes and Johnson with the armed\\n\\nrobbery conviction. At the outset, we note that the trial court erred\\n\\nin sentencing Appellant on the armed robbery count. Because the\\n\\narmed robbery served as the underlying felony for the felony murder\\n\\n                                 32\\n conviction on which Appellant was sentenced, the conviction and\\n\\nsentence for armed robbery must be vacated. See Ruff v. State, 314\\n\\nGa. 386, 389 (877 SE2d 239) (2022) (where a defendant is “found\\n\\nguilty only of felony murder, the underlying felony would certainly\\n\\nbe deemed to have merged, as a matter of law, into the felony murder\\n\\nand a separate sentence for that underlying felony would not be\\n\\nauthorized” (cleaned up)). However, “the same merger analysis\\n\\napplies in determining whether the . . . aggravated assault merged\\n\\ninto either the armed robbery conviction or the felony murder\\n\\npredicated on that armed robbery.” Hood v. State, 309 Ga. 493, 503\\n\\nn.9 (847 SE2d 172) (2020) (cleaned up). In this regard, we have held\\n\\nthat “because there is no element of aggravated assault with a\\n\\ndeadly weapon that is not contained in armed robbery, that form of\\n\\naggravated assault will merge into armed robbery if the crimes are\\n\\npart of the same act or transaction.” Id. at 502-503 (cleaned up).\\n\\nHowever, “where one crime is completed before another crime, the\\n\\n‘same conduct’ does not establish the commission of both offenses.”\\n\\nJackson v. State, 318 Ga. 393, 411 (897 SE2d 785) (2024) (cleaned\\n\\n                                33\\n up). Here, the aggravated assaults of Holmes and Johnson were\\n\\ncompleted once Appellant and Spinks entered the house and pointed\\n\\ntheir guns at Holmes and Johnson, and the armed robbery was\\n\\nbased on Appellant and Spinks subsequently taking the victims to\\n\\nbedrooms in the back of the house and taking a purse from one of\\n\\nthe bedrooms. Under these circumstances, the aggravated assaults\\n\\ndo not merge with the armed robbery conviction. See Thomas v.\\n\\nState, 289 Ga. 877, 878-881 (717 SE2d 187) (2011) (holding that\\n\\nwhere the defendant committed an armed robbery against the\\n\\nvictim in the music room of an apartment, but where the victim was\\n\\nsubsequently forced into a nearby bathroom and the defendant\\n\\ncommitted an aggravated assault against the victim in the\\n\\nbathroom, the conviction for aggravated assault did not merge with\\n\\nthe conviction for armed robbery because “although the conviction\\n\\nfor the armed robbery of [the victim] also resulted from the music-\\n\\nroom holdup, the conviction for his aggravated assault was based on\\n\\nAppellant’s forcing the shotgun down his throat later in the\\n\\nbathroom, as the indictment clearly specified”). Cf. Womac v. State,\\n\\n                                34\\n 302 Ga. 681, 681-682, 684-685 (808 SE2d 709) (2017) (holding that\\n\\nwhere the evidence showed that the defendant committed an\\n\\naggravated sexual battery against a minor on the bed of a motel\\n\\nroom, causing the victim to run into the bathroom, where the\\n\\ndefendant committed other crimes, the aggravated sexual battery\\n\\ndid not merge with the other crimes under Drinkard v. Walker, 281\\n\\nGa. 211 (636 SE2d 530) (2006), because it was completed before the\\n\\nother crimes were committed).\\n\\n     In addition, contrary to Appellant’s contention, the trial court\\n\\ndid not err in sentencing Appellant for the separate assaults of\\n\\nHolmes and Johnson, as those counts do not merge with each other.\\n\\nSee Sillah v. State, 315 Ga. 741, 758 (883 SE2d 756) (2023) (“If\\n\\ncrimes are committed against different victims . . . , they do not\\n\\nmerge.”). Finally, Appellant correctly claims (and the State\\n\\nconcedes) that the trial court should have merged the offense of\\n\\nconspiracy to commit armed robbery with the conviction for felony\\n\\nmurder predicated on armed robbery. See OCGA § 16-4-8.1 (a\\n\\n“person may not be convicted of both conspiracy to commit a crime\\n\\n                                 35\\n and the completed crime”); Simmons v. State, 314 Ga. 883, 893 (880\\n\\nSE2d 125) (2022) (explaining that “the trial court properly merged\\n\\nthe count[] alleging conspiracy to commit aggravated assault [of the\\n\\nvictim] . . . into the felony murder conviction predicated on\\n\\naggravated assault [of the victim]” (cleaned up)).\\n\\n     7. Appellant claims that the prosecutor made several improper\\n\\narguments in closing. In particular, Appellant complains that the\\n\\nprosecutor referred to him as a “drug dealer.” Appellant, however,\\n\\ndid not object to any part of the prosecutor’s closing argument. His\\n\\nclaim is therefore not preserved for review. See Poellnitz v. State,\\n\\n296 Ga. 134, 136 (765 SE2d 343) (2014) (holding that the defendant’s\\n\\ncontention that the prosecutor made improper remarks during\\n\\nclosing argument was not preserved for review because of the failure\\n\\nto make a contemporaneous objection).\\n\\n     8.   Appellant contends that his trial counsel provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to object when\\n\\nAgent Ingalls testified as to her interpretation of certain text\\n\\nmessages and when the State introduced autopsy photographs that\\n\\n                                 36\\n he contends were gruesome and prejudicial. However, Appellant did\\n\\nnot raise either of these claims in his motion for new trial or in his\\n\\namended motion, where he was represented by appellate counsel.\\n\\nHe also did not raise them at the hearing on his motion for new trial,\\n\\nand the trial court did not rule on the claims. Accordingly, he has\\n\\nnot preserved these claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\\n\\nfor review. See, e.g., Allen v. State, 317 Ga. 1, 12-13 (890 SE2d 700)\\n\\n(2023) (explaining that “ineffectiveness claims must be raised and\\n\\npursued at the earliest practicable moment, which for a claim of\\n\\nineffective assistance of trial counsel is at the motion for new trial\\n\\nstage if the defendant is no longer represented by the attorney who\\n\\nrepresented him at trial” and holding that appellant did not\\n\\npreserve for review a claim of ineffective assistance where he failed\\n\\nto raise the claim in his initial motion for new trial or the\\n\\namendment or during the hearing on the motion for new trial, and\\n\\nthe trial court did not address the claim in its order denying the\\n\\nmotion for new trial (cleaned up)).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed in part and vacated in part. All the Justices\\n\\n                                 37\\n concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          38\\n '),\n",

IN THE MATTER OF CURTIS LEE ALLEN.\\n\\n        PER CURIAM.\\n\\n        This disciplinary matter is before the Court on a petition for\\n\\nvoluntary reciprocal discipline filed by Respondent Curtis Lee Allen\\n\\n(State Bar No. 009905), pursuant to Rule 9.4 (b) of the Georgia Rules\\n\\nof Professional Conduct (“GRPC”) and Bar Rule 4-227 (b). In his\\n\\npetition, Allen, who has been a member of the State Bars of Georgia\\n\\nand Florida since 1994, asks this Court to impose a ten-day\\n\\nsuspension, nunc pro tunc, as substantially similar discipline to a\\n\\nten-day suspension he received in Florida for his conduct in\\n\\nrepresenting an insurance company in two cases. In its response, the\\n\\nState Bar urges the Court to accept Allen’s petition. We agree that\\n\\na ten-day suspension is appropriate as “substantially similar\\n\\ndiscipline,” see GRPC 9.4 (b) (3), for the suspension Allen received\\n in   Florida.   Nevertheless,     Allen’s   petition    contains    several\\n\\ndeficiencies that preclude final resolution of this matter at this time.\\n\\nAccordingly, we reject his petition for voluntary reciprocal\\n\\ndiscipline.\\n\\n     To resolve two disciplinary actions pending against him in\\n\\nFlorida, Allen and the Florida Bar entered into a consent judgment,\\n\\npursuant to which the Florida Supreme Court entered an order on\\n\\nDecember 28, 2023, suspending him from the practice of law for ten\\n\\ndays, effective January 29, 2024, placing him on probation for one\\n\\nyear, directing him to attend the Florida Bar’s Ethics School, and\\n\\nentering judgment against him in the amount of $1,450.10 for the\\n\\ncost of the Florida Bar’s action against him.1 Allen states that he\\n\\nserved his suspension from January 29 to February 7, 2024. The\\n\\nState Bar of Georgia then initiated a reciprocal disciplinary action\\n\\nagainst Allen pursuant to GRPC 9.4 (b), and in response, he filed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     1 Although Allen states in his petition that the Florida Supreme Court’s\\n\\norder and the consent judgment are “attached,” neither of those documents\\nappears in the record before this Court.\\n\\n                                     2\\n this petition for voluntary discipline. See GRPC 9.4 (b); Bar Rule 4-\\n\\n227 (b).\\n\\n      In his petition, Allen explains that in the first disciplinary\\n\\nmatter, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal observed in a\\n\\npublished opinion that, while representing an insurance company,\\n\\nAllen “made argumentative and unprofessional remarks to both the\\n\\ninsureds and their counsel” while conducting examinations under\\n\\noath. In the second matter, while representing the same insurance\\n\\ncompany in a dispute over attorney fees, he made comments about\\n\\nthe opposing party and counsel “which were not consistent with the\\n\\nhigh standards of professionalism.” In both matters, he was found\\n\\nto have violated Florida Rules 3-4.3 (Misconduct and Minor\\n\\nMisconduct),2 4-4.4 (a) (Respect for Rights of Third Persons),3 and 4-\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Florida Rule 3-4.3 provides in relevant part that “[t]he commission by\\n\\na lawyer of any act that is unlawful or contrary to honesty and justice may\\nconstitute a cause for discipline whether the act is committed in the course of\\nthe lawyer’s relations as a lawyer or otherwise, whether committed within\\nFlorida or outside the state of Florida, and whether the act is a felony or a\\nmisdemeanor.”\\n      3 Florida Rule 4-4.4 (a) provides that “[i]n representing a client, a lawyer\\n\\nmay not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass,\\n\\n                                        3\\n 8.4 (d) (Misconduct).4 Allen observes that Florida Rule 4-4.4 (a) is\\n\\nanalogous to GRPC 4.4 (a), but Georgia does not have a disciplinary\\n\\nrule equivalent to Florida Rules 3-4.3 or 4-8.4 (d). Allen states that\\n\\nin the consent judgment with the Florida Bar, he stipulated to four\\n\\naggravating      factors:    prior    disciplinary     history,    pattern     of\\n\\nmisconduct, multiple offenses, and substantial experience in the\\n\\npractice of law. See ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions\\n\\n(“ABA Standards”) 9.22 (a), (c), (d), and (i). He asserts that the\\n\\nFlorida Bar stipulated to four mitigating factors: absence of a\\n\\ndishonest or selfish motive, personal or emotional problems arising\\n\\nfrom or related to his stressful divorce at the time of his misconduct,\\n\\nfull and free disclosure to the bar or cooperative attitude toward the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndelay, or burden a third person or knowingly use methods of obtaining evidence\\nthat violate the legal rights of such a person.”\\n      4 Florida Rule 4-8.4 (d) provides in relevant part that “A lawyer shall not\\n\\n. . . engage in conduct in connection with the practice of law that is prejudicial\\nto the administration of justice, including to knowingly, or through callous\\nindifference, disparage, humiliate, or discriminate against litigants, jurors,\\nwitnesses, court personnel, or other lawyers on any basis, including, but not\\nlimited to, on account of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, national origin,\\ndisability, marital status, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status,\\nemployment, or physical characteristic[.]”\\n\\n                                        4\\n disciplinary proceedings, and remorse. See ABA Standards 9.32 (b),\\n\\n(c), (e), and (l). He assures the Court that he has taken steps to\\n\\nensure that his future conduct will be professional and will comply\\n\\nwith disciplinary rules. Accordingly, he requests, as substantially\\n\\nsimilar discipline, that this Court suspend his license to practice law\\n\\nin Georgia for ten days, nunc pro tunc and concurrent with his\\n\\nFlorida suspension, and that the Court allow his reinstatement upon\\n\\nthe entry of its opinion.\\n\\n     The State Bar responds by agreeing with Allen’s recitation of\\n\\nthe disciplinary matters against him and by stating that it does not\\n\\ncontest the facts that Allen expressed remorse for his actions and\\n\\ncooperated fully with the Florida Bar. Therefore, the State Bar\\n\\nrecommends that the Court accept Allen’s voluntary petition and\\n\\nimpose the requested discipline.\\n\\n     This Court has generally interpreted the Bar Rules governing\\n\\nreciprocal discipline to require the imposition of substantially\\n\\nsimilar discipline as was imposed in the other jurisdiction, and here,\\n\\nthe ten-day suspension Allen requests is identical to the suspension\\n\\n                                   5\\n he served in Florida.5 See In the Matter of Van Dyke, 316 Ga. 168,\\n\\n177 (886 SE2d 811) (2023) (noting “the nature of reciprocal\\n\\ndiscipline matters[,] . . . wherein this Court must only impose\\n\\n‘substantially similar’ discipline”). See also In the Matter of\\n\\nPettinato, 315 Ga. 831, 835-836 (884 SE2d 894) (2023) (accepting\\n\\nattorney’s voluntary petition for reciprocal discipline and imposing\\n\\nten-day suspension, which is generally not a disciplinary sanction\\n\\navailable in Georgia, because the requested suspension was\\n\\n“identical” to discipline imposed in Florida). However, we decline to\\n\\naccept Allen’s petition at this stage for two reasons. First, although\\n\\nAllen’s petition references various documents associated with the\\n\\nFlorida disciplinary proceeding, no such documents were attached\\n\\nfor our review. See In the Matter of Thompson, 310 Ga. 753, 754 (854\\n\\n\\n\\n     5   Allen is on disciplinary probation in Florida for one year, but the\\nGeorgia Bar Rules do not provide for probation as a sanction. However, this\\nCourt has previously approved reciprocal suspensions “without adding time for\\nthe probationary period” imposed by other jurisdictions, so this would not\\npreclude our acceptance of his petition. See, e.g., In the Matter of Thompson,\\n315 Ga. 81, 85 (880 SE2d 214) (2022); In the Matter of Hanzelik, 294 Ga. 727,\\n728 (755 SE2d 758) (2014). Instead, as explained below, we reject his petition\\nbecause of his failure to make certain showings in connection with his request\\nfor reciprocal discipline.\\n\\n                                      6\\n SE2d 522) (2021) (rejecting attorney’s voluntary petition for\\n\\nreciprocal suspension for, inter alia, failing to provide documents\\n\\nfrom his Florida disciplinary proceeding). Second, although Allen\\n\\nrequests that his suspension be imposed nunc pro tunc to the dates\\n\\nhe served his suspension in Florida, he has failed to show that he is\\n\\nentitled to a retroactive suspension. This Court has held that “when\\n\\nan attorney requests entry of a suspension or voluntary surrender\\n\\norder nunc pro tunc, it is the lawyer’s responsibility to demonstrate\\n\\nthat they voluntarily stopped practicing law, the date on which their\\n\\nlaw practice ended, and that they complied with all the ethical\\n\\nobligations implicated in such a decision, such as assisting clients in\\n\\nsecuring new counsel and facilitating the transfer of client files and\\n\\ncritical information about ongoing cases to new counsel.” In the\\n\\nMatter of Onipede, 288 Ga. 156, 157 (702 SE2d 136) (2010). This\\n\\nCourt has imposed retroactive suspensions as reciprocal discipline\\n\\nwhen the attorney made a showing that he or she stopped practicing\\n\\nlaw in Georgia while suspended in another jurisdiction, which the\\n\\nState Bar did not contest or dispute. See, e.g., In the Matter of Van\\n\\n                                  7\\n Dyke, 316 Ga. 168, 177 (3) (886 SE2d 811) (2023) (imposing\\n\\nretroactive suspension as reciprocal discipline where attorney\\n\\nprovided evidence that he stopped practicing law in Georgia in\\n\\nFebruary 2019); In the Matter of Thompson, 315 Ga. 81, 85 (880\\n\\nSE2d 214) (2022) (imposing retroactive suspension as reciprocal\\n\\ndiscipline where attorney showed that he was not practicing law in\\n\\nGeorgia and the State Bar indicated that he was on inactive status).\\n\\nHere, in contrast, Allen failed to provide any evidence that he\\n\\nstopped practicing law in Georgia during his suspension in Florida.\\n\\nAccordingly, he has not made the necessary showing to have his\\n\\nsuspension imposed nunc pro tunc to the dates of his Florida\\n\\nsuspension. When this Court finds a voluntary petition for discipline\\n\\ndeficient, our practice is to reject the petition. See In the Matter of\\n\\nThompson, 310 Ga. 753, 654 (854 SE2d 522) (2021) (rejecting\\n\\npetition for voluntary reciprocal discipline, even though the State\\n\\nBar recommended the Court accept the petition, due to several\\n\\ndeficiencies in the petition, including that the attorney referenced,\\n\\nbut failed to attach, documents associated with his Florida\\n\\n                                  8\\n disciplinary proceeding). Accordingly, we reject Allen’s petition for\\n\\nvoluntary reciprocal discipline.\\n\\n     Petition for voluntary discipline rejected.

GOLDEN v. FLOYD HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT,\\n           INC. d/b/a FLOYD MEDICAL CENTER.\\n\\n        MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n         On October 21, 2021, Jami Lynn Golden filed a renewal action\\n\\nagainst Floyd Healthcare Management, Inc. d/b/a Floyd Medical\\n\\nCenter (“Floyd Medical”) in Floyd County Superior Court, asserting\\n\\nclaims of medical malpractice and hospital negligence, among other\\n\\nclaims. Floyd Medical moved to dismiss, arguing in part that OCGA\\n\\n§ 9-3-71 (b), a five-year medical malpractice statute of repose,\\n\\nexpired in July 2021 and thus time-barred Golden’s suit. The trial\\n\\ncourt denied that motion, concluding that the claims were not time-\\n\\nbarred by OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) because the repose statute was tolled\\n\\nby former Chief Justice Harold D. Melton’s “Order Declaring\\n\\nStatewide Judicial Emergency” dated March 14, 2020 (“March 14\\n\\nOrder”). The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that OCGA § 9-3-71\\n (b) was not tolled by the March 14 Order but, instead, that OCGA §\\n\\n9-3-71 (b) expired before Golden filed her renewal complaint. See\\n\\nGolden v. Floyd Healthcare Mgmt., Inc., 368 Ga. App. 409, 417-25\\n\\n(3) (890 SE2d 288) (2023). For the reasons below, we conclude that\\n\\nGolden’s claims were not time-barred because the March 14 Order\\n\\ntolled OCGA § 9-3-71 (b), and that under these circumstances there\\n\\nis no impediment in the federal or Georgia Constitutions for the\\n\\nstatute of repose to be tolled, so we reverse.\\n\\n     1. An appellate court “review[s] de novo a trial court’s ruling on\\n\\na motion to dismiss, accepting as true all well-pled material\\n\\nallegations in the complaint and resolving any doubts in favor of the\\n\\nplaintiff.” Maynard v. Snapchat, Inc., 313 Ga. 533, 535 (2) (870 SE2d\\n\\n739) (2022) (citation and punctuation omitted). Viewed in this light,\\n\\nthe record shows that:\\n\\n           Golden visited Floyd Emergency Care Center at\\n     approximately 8:30 p.m. on July 1, 2016, complaining of\\n     abdominal pain, fever, chills, and nausea. Among other\\n     readings taken during Golden’s triage assessment,\\n     medical staff noted that she had a low-grade fever, a heart\\n     rate of 118 beats per minute, a white blood cell count of\\n     4.9, and bands of 15 percent. As a result of these readings,\\n\\n                                   2\\n Golden alleged that she satisfied two general internal\\ncriteria of “systemic inflammatory response syndrome”\\n(or, SIRS) to be monitored for sepsis — an elevated heart\\nrate and bands in excess of 10 percent.\\n      A nurse practitioner [Charles William Stein] initially\\nsuggested that Golden was suffering from an ovarian cyst\\nor endometriosis and administered saline fluid and\\nmedications to control her pain. At approximately 2:00\\na.m. on July 2, “a computer generated Sepsis Alert\\nconcerning . . . Golden activated based on an algorithm\\nthat interpreted her vital signs and lab results as being at\\nrisk for sepsis[.]” Golden alleged that [Sharon] Gaylor, the\\ncharge nurse on duty at the time of the sepsis alert, failed\\nto forward the alert to the attending physician on duty [Dr.\\nGarrett H. Barnes] and the primary nurse assigned to\\nGolden, in violation of Floyd Medical’s written sepsis alert\\npolicy. Golden was prescribed additional pain medication\\nand discharged approximately one hour after the sepsis\\nalert, with instructions to follow up in two to three days.\\n      Golden’s symptoms persisted and her condition\\nworsened throughout the day, including the onset of\\nadditional symptoms of a sore throat, headache, dizziness,\\nand shortness of breath. At approximately 4:00 p.m. on\\nJuly 2, an ambulance transported Golden, by then in\\nseptic shock, to Redmond Regional Emergency Care\\nCenter for treatment. Medical staff initiated Redmond\\nRegional’s sepsis protocol, administered extensive\\ntreatment of Golden, and admitted Golden to the Redmond\\nRegional Medical Center Intensive Care Unit. Golden\\nremained in Redmond Regional’s ICU for 11 days before\\ntransferring to University of Alabama-Birmingham\\nMedical Center for further treatment. As a result of the\\nseptic shock, Golden suffered necrosis that required the\\namputation of parts of her fingers and toes.\\n\\n\\n                             3\\n Golden, 368 Ga. App. at 410-12 (footnote omitted).\\n\\n     In June 2018, Golden filed suit in federal court against Floyd\\n\\nMedical, the      attending physician (Dr.         Barnes),    the   nurse\\n\\npractitioner (Stein), and a physician’s assistant (Danny Day\\n\\nRogers), among others. Her complaint asserted several claims,\\n\\nincluding claims for medical malpractice and hospital negligence.\\n\\n     During the pendency of her case, the COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\nbegan. In response to the pandemic, former Chief Justice Melton\\n\\nissued the March 14 Order, citing as the basis of his authority,\\n\\nOCGA § 38-3-62. As pertinent here, the March 14 Order provided:\\n\\n     Pursuant to OCGA § 38-3-62, during the period of this\\n     Order, the undersigned hereby suspends, tolls, extends,\\n     and otherwise grants relief from any deadlines or other\\n     time schedules or filing requirements imposed by\\n     otherwise applicable statutes, rules, regulations, or court\\n     orders, whether in civil or criminal cases or\\n     administrative matters, including, but not limited to any:\\n     (1) statute of limitation . . . and (11) such other legal\\n     proceedings as determined to be necessary by the\\n     authorized judicial official. 1\\n\\n\\n     1   Order Declaring Statewide Judicial Emergency (Mar. 14, 2020),\\nhttps://www.gasupreme.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CJ-Melton-amended-\\nStatewide-Jud-Emergency-order.pdf. The March 14 Order did not explicitly set\\nout that statutes of repose were tolled pursuant to the order. See id.\\n                                     4\\n This Court subsequently issued several documents clarifying the\\n\\neffect of the March 14 Order. On March 27, 2020, this Court issued\\n\\na document called “Guidance on Tolling Filing Deadlines Under the\\n\\nChief Justice’s Order Declaring Statewide Judicial Emergency”\\n\\n(“March 27 Guidance”) applicable to “all proceedings and filing\\n\\ndeadlines,” clarifying that the March 14 Order tolled all “non-\\n\\nconstitutional filing deadlines” if the “filing deadline date was after\\n\\nMarch 14, 2020[.]”2 On April 6, 2020, this Court issued another\\n\\nguiding document clarifying that “[i]f the period of limitation for a\\n\\nparticular cause of action commenced prior to March 14, 2020 . . .\\n\\nthe running of the period of limitation was suspended on March 14”\\n\\nand would “resume when the tolling provision of the March 14\\n\\ndeclaration . . . expired or [was] otherwise terminated.”3 Finally, on\\n\\nJuly 10, 2020, then-Chief Justice Melton issued an order that\\n\\n\\n     2 Guidance on Tolling Filing Deadlines Under the Chief Justice’s Order\\n\\nDeclaring     Statewide      Judicial    Emergency    (Mar.    27,    2020),\\nhttps://www.gasupreme.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Guidance-for-tolling-\\nfiling-deadlines-final-3.30.20-002.pdf.\\n       3 Guidance on Tolling Statutes of Limitation Under the Chief Justice’s\\n\\nOrder Declaring Statewide Judicial Emergency (Apr. 6, 2020),\\nhttps://www.gasupreme.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Guidance-for-Tolling-\\nStatutes-of-Limitation-04_06_20.pdf.\\n                                     5\\n reinstated, starting from July 14, 2020, all deadlines suspended,\\n\\ntolled, or extended by the March 14 Order, subject to exceptions not\\n\\nrelevant here.4\\n\\n      In June 2021, the federal district court granted a motion by the\\n\\ndefendants to strike Golden’s expert Rule 26 disclosures, and she\\n\\nthen filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss her complaint without\\n\\nprejudice, which the district court granted.\\n\\n      On October 21, 2021, Golden filed a renewal action in Floyd\\n\\nCounty Superior Court against Floyd Medical, asserting claims of\\n\\nmedical malpractice and hospital negligence in Count I of her\\n\\nrenewal complaint. 5 Floyd Medical moved to dismiss, arguing in part\\n\\nthat OCGA § 9-3-71 (b), the five-year medical malpractice statute of\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Fourth Order Extending Declaration of Statewide Judicial Emergency\\n\\n(Jul. 10, 2020), https://www.gasupreme.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4th-\\nSJEO-FINAL.pdf. We refer to the March 14 Order, the guiding documents\\nissued on March 27 and April 6, and the July 10 reinstatement order, as,\\ncollectively, “the COVID emergency orders.”\\n       5 Count II of Golden’s renewal complaint asserted a claim of “ordinary\\n\\nnegligence.” The trial court dismissed Count II on the grounds that the\\nordinary negligence claim did not relate back to the filing of the initial\\ncomplaint and was barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations,\\nand the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. See Golden, 368 Ga. App. at\\n415-16 (1) (b). We did not grant Golden’s petition for certiorari on this issue.\\n                                       6\\n repose, expired on July 1-2, 2021, five years from Golden’s allegedly\\n\\nnegligent treatment, and so her October 21, 2021 renewal complaint\\n\\nwas time-barred. The trial court denied Floyd Medical’s motion to\\n\\ndismiss with respect to Golden’s Count I medical malpractice and\\n\\nhospital negligence claims, determining that Chief Justice Melton’s\\n\\nMarch 14 Order tolled OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) for 122 days such that the\\n\\nrepose period for those claims expired on October 31, 2021.\\n\\n     The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Golden’s claims\\n\\nwere barred by the five-year medical malpractice statute of repose\\n\\nin OCGA § 9-3-71 (b). See Golden, 368 Ga. App. at 417-25 (3). The\\n\\nCourt of Appeals reasoned that the March 14 Order did not toll\\n\\nOCGA § 9-3-71 (b), because Georgia courts, even in cases decided\\n\\nafter the enactment of the Judicial Emergency Act in 2004, have\\n\\nheld that statutes of repose are “absolute” and “cannot be tolled,” see\\n\\ne.g., Simmons v. Sonyika, 279 Ga. 378, 379-80 (614 SE2d 27) (2005)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted), and because the March 14 Order\\n\\nand subsequent guiding documents did not specifically state that the\\n\\nMarch 14 Order tolled statutes of repose. See Golden, 368 Ga. App.\\n\\n                                  7\\n at 422-25 (3).\\n\\n      This Court, in turn, granted review to consider three questions:\\n\\n      (1)   Does OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) empower “[a]n authorized\\n            judicial official” to “suspend, toll, extend, or\\n            otherwise grant relief from” the application of a\\n            statute of repose?\\n\\n      (2)   Did Chief Justice Melton’s “Order Declaring\\n            Statewide Judicial Emergency” dated March 14,\\n            2020, and subsequent orders suspend, toll, extend,\\n            or otherwise grant relief from the application of a\\n            statute of repose?\\n\\n      (3)   Assuming that the answers to questions (1) and (2)\\n            are “yes,” can OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) and Chief Justice\\n            Melton’s COVID emergency orders be applied to toll\\n            the statute of repose in OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) consistent\\n            with the federal and Georgia Constitutions? See\\n            Southern States Chemical, Inc. v. Tampa Tank &\\n            Welding, Inc., 316 Ga. 701 (888 SE2d 553) (2023).\\n\\n      3. Turning now to the first question, we answer it in the\\n\\naffirmative: OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) empowers an “authorized judicial\\n\\nofficial”—here, Chief Justice Melton6—to “suspend, toll, extend, or\\n\\notherwise grant relief from” the application of a statute of repose.\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 OCGA § 38-3-60 (1) (A) explicitly defines the term “[a]uthorized judicial\\n\\nofficial,” as used in OCGA § 38-3-62 (a), as including “[t]he Chief Justice of the\\nGeorgia Supreme Court[.]”\\n                                        8\\n      OCGA § 38-3-62—which the Georgia General Assembly\\n\\nenacted in 2004 as part of the “Judicial Emergency Act of 2004”\\n\\n(OCGA §§ 38-3-60 et seq.), see Ga. L. 2004, pp. 420-21, §§ 1-3—\\n\\nprovides in subsection (a) that:\\n\\n          An authorized judicial official in an order declaring\\n     a judicial emergency, or in an order modifying or\\n     extending a judicial emergency order, is authorized to\\n     suspend, toll, extend, or otherwise grant relief from\\n     deadlines or other time schedules or filing requirements\\n     imposed by otherwise applicable statutes, rules,\\n     regulations, or court orders, whether in civil or criminal\\n     cases or administrative matters, including, but not\\n     limited to . . . (1) A statute of limitation . . . and (11) Such\\n     other legal proceedings as determined to be necessary by\\n     the authorized judicial official.\\n\\nOCGA § 38-3-62 (a).7\\n\\n     The question before us—whether OCGA § 38-3-62 (a)\\n\\nempowers an authorized judicial official to toll, suspend, extend, or\\n\\notherwise grant relief from a statute of repose—turns on whether a\\n\\nrepose statute falls within the meaning of “deadlines or other time\\n\\nschedules or filing requirements imposed by otherwise applicable\\n\\n\\n\\n     7 OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) does not explicitly set out that statutes of repose\\n\\nmay be tolled by a judicial emergency order.\\n                                      9\\n statutes . . . including, but not limited to” the list of items that OCGA\\n\\n§§ 38-3-62 (a) (1)-(11) enumerates. See OCGA § 38-3-62 (a).\\n\\n     When we consider the meaning of a statute, we “presume that\\n\\nthe General Assembly meant what it said and said what it meant.”\\n\\nBell v. Hargrove, 313 Ga. 30, 32 (2) (867 SE2d 101) (2021) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). Thus, “we must afford the statutory text\\n\\nits plain and ordinary meaning, . . . view the statutory text in the\\n\\ncontext in which it appears, and . . . read the statutory text in its\\n\\nmost natural and reasonable way, as an ordinary speaker of the\\n\\nEnglish language would. . . . [I]f the statutory text is clear and\\n\\nunambiguous, we attribute to the statute its plain meaning, and our\\n\\nsearch for statutory meaning is at an end.” Mayor v. Harris, 302 Ga.\\n\\n853, 854-55 (809 SE2d 806) (2018) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     Here, it is clear and unambiguous that statutes of repose fall\\n\\nwithin the meaning of “deadlines” under OCGA § 38-3-62 (a). To\\n\\nstart, a statute of repose is within the plain and ordinary meaning\\n\\nof a “deadline” imposed by a statute. A “deadline” ordinarily refers\\n\\n                                   10\\n to a “time limit” such as one for the “completion of an assignment,”\\n\\nsee The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 466\\n\\n(4th ed. 2000), and a statute of repose provides just that—a time\\n\\nlimit by which a litigant can file a non-barred suit, see Black’s Law\\n\\nDictionary 1423 (7th ed. 1999) (defining a “statute of repose” as “a\\n\\nstatute that bars a suit a fixed number of years after the defendant\\n\\nacts in some way . . . even if this period ends before the plaintiff has\\n\\nsuffered any injury” (emphasis added)). Also, our case law has\\n\\nrepeatedly referred to a statute of repose as a “deadline.” See e.g.,\\n\\nRosenberg v. Falling Water, Inc., 289 Ga. 57, 60 (709 SE2d 227)\\n\\n(2011) (“[T]he defendant would not be allowed to cause the plaintiff\\n\\nto miss the deadline imposed by the statute of repose and then use\\n\\nthat same statute to defeat the plaintiff’s otherwise viable action.”\\n\\n(emphasis added)); Robinson v. Boyd, 288 Ga. 53, 57 (2) (701 SE2d\\n\\n165) (2010) (“Where the General Assembly wishes to put a firm\\n\\ndeadline on filing lawsuits, it knows how to enact a statute of repose\\n\\ninstead of a statute of limitation.” (emphasis added)).\\n\\n     Floyd Medical argues that OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) does not\\n\\n                                  11\\n authorize the tolling of statutes of repose because OCGA § 38-3-62\\n\\n(a) does not specifically mention such statutes. But Floyd Medical\\n\\noffers no case, and we know of none, holding that a law must\\n\\nmention a statute of repose to toll it or to authorize its tolling. As\\n\\nexplained above, OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) provides that “deadlines” can\\n\\nbe tolled, and a statute of repose is plainly a “deadline.” And, while\\n\\nOCGA § 38-3-62 (a) does not specifically mention a repose statute as\\n\\na deadline that can be tolled, OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) makes clear that\\n\\nthe list of “deadlines” it authorizes to be tolled is non-exhaustive, by\\n\\nintroducing that list with the language “including, but not limited\\n\\nto” (emphasis added). See Raffensperger v. Jackson, 316 Ga. 383, 386\\n\\n(1) n.6 (888 SE2d 483) (2023) (“By specifying that the named services\\n\\n‘shall include, but not be limited to,’ the list is not exhaustive.”);\\n\\nRockdale County. v. U.S. Enterprises, Inc., 312 Ga. 752, 765 (3) (865\\n\\nSE2d 135) (2021) (pointing to the phrase “including but not limited\\n\\nto” in a statute as “a means of introducing non-exhaustive examples”\\n\\n(punctuation omitted)). Thus, Floyd Medical’s argument fails.\\n\\n      At times, Floyd Medical also appears to argue that a statute of\\n\\n                                  12\\n repose cannot be tolled under any circumstances, relying on\\n\\nSimmons, 279 Ga. at 380, where we stated that “by definition, a\\n\\nstatute of ultimate repose cannot be ‘tolled’” (quoting Osburn v.\\n\\nGoldman, 269 Ga. App. 303, 303 (1) (a) (603 SE2d 695) (2004)). See\\n\\nalso Simmons, 279 Ga. at 380 (“statutes of repose may not be ‘tolled’\\n\\nfor any reason” (citation and punctuation omitted)). But as Floyd\\n\\nMedical concedes, the legislature has tolled such statutes in the\\n\\npast. See e.g., OCGA § 9-3-73 (c) (2) (A) (tolling the repose period set\\n\\nforth in OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) for children under the age of five until\\n\\ntheir tenth birthday).\\n\\n     In any event, Simmons does not assist Floyd Medical’s\\n\\nargument. In Simmons, the issue was whether OCGA § 9-3-92,\\n\\nwhich provides that the “time between the death of a person and the\\n\\ncommencement of representation upon his estate . . . shall not be\\n\\ncounted against his estate in calculating any limitation applicable\\n\\nto the bringing of an action,” tolled a later-enacted statute of repose,\\n\\nOCGA § 9-3-71 (b). In concluding that it did not, Simmons reasoned\\n\\nthat, as a matter of statutory construction, OCGA § 9-3-92 referred\\n\\n                                  13\\n to statutes of limitation and could not have contemplated a statute\\n\\nof repose that was enacted over 100 years later. See Simmons, 279\\n\\nGa. at 379 (“Because we presume that the legislature enacts all\\n\\nstatutes with knowledge of the existing laws, the provisions of the\\n\\nmore recently adopted medical malpractice statute of repose carry\\n\\ngreater weight than those of the preexisting unrepresented estate\\n\\nstatute.”). For additional support, Simmons then stated, quoting\\n\\nonly part of a sentence from a Court of Appeals case, that “[b]y\\n\\ndefinition, a statute of ultimate repose cannot be ‘tolled[.]’” Id. at 380\\n\\n(quoting Osburn, 269 Ga. App. at 303 (1) (a), but omitting a caveat\\n\\nthat Osburn contained: “‘[B]y definition, a statute of ultimate repose\\n\\ncannot be “tolled” to permit actions to be brought for injuries which\\n\\ndid not occur until after the statutory period had expired.’” (emphasis\\n\\nadded)).\\n\\n     Here, by contrast, OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) was enacted after the\\n\\nfive-year medical malpractice statute of repose and in contemplation\\n\\nthat filing deadlines may need to be tolled or suspended because of\\n\\na judicial emergency. Applying Simmons’s reasoning, we determine\\n\\n                                   14\\n that by referring to filing “deadlines,” the later-enacted tolling\\n\\nprovision (OCGA § 38-3-62 (a)) contemplates and authorizes the\\n\\ntolling of statutes of repose.\\n\\n      Moreover, we decline to read Simmons as holding that the\\n\\nlegislature can never toll or authorize the tolling of a statute of\\n\\nrepose given that the unrepresented estate statute in Simmons did\\n\\nnot contemplate the tolling of a later-enacted repose statute, that\\n\\nSimmons omitted a caveat from Osburn when quoting it, and that\\n\\nthe legislature has provided for circumstances when a repose statute\\n\\nmay be tolled. See Simmons, 279 Ga. at 379-80; OCGA § 9-3-73 (c)\\n\\n(2) (A). And to the extent that Simmons—or any other case from a\\n\\nGeorgia court8—can be read to establish an absolute rule that a\\n\\nstatute of repose can never be tolled under any circumstances, we\\n\\ndisapprove of such a holding.\\n\\n      For these reasons, we answer our first question on certiorari in\\n\\n\\n      8 See e.g., Rosenberg v. Falling Water, Inc., 302 Ga. App. 78, 80 (1) (a)\\n\\n(690 SE2d 183) (2009) (“statutes of repose may not be ‘tolled’ for any reason”\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)); Balotin v. Simpson, 286 Ga. App. 772, 773\\n(650 SE2d 253) (2007) (“the statute of repose, unlike a statute of limitation,\\nmay not be tolled for any reason”).\\n                                      15\\n the affirmative: OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) empowers “[a]n authorized\\n\\njudicial official” to “suspend, toll, extend, or otherwise grant relief\\n\\nfrom” the application of a statute of repose.\\n\\n     4. Turning to the second certiorari question, we also answer it\\n\\nin the affirmative. The COVID emergency orders suspended, tolled,\\n\\nextended, and otherwise granted relief from the application of a\\n\\nstatute of repose. Mirroring the language of OCGA § 38-3-62 (a), the\\n\\nMarch 14 Order stated that “the undersigned hereby suspends, tolls,\\n\\nextends, and otherwise grants relief from any deadlines . . . imposed\\n\\nby otherwise applicable statutes . . . including, but not limited to\\n\\nany: (1) statute of limitation . . . and (11) such other legal\\n\\nproceedings as determined to be necessary by the authorized judicial\\n\\nofficial.” (emphasis added). The March 27 Guidance explicitly\\n\\nclarified that the March 14 Order applied to “all proceedings and\\n\\nfiling deadlines.” As explained above, a statute of repose is plainly a\\n\\n“deadline” by which a litigant can file a non-barred suit. And, just\\n\\nlike above, the list of “deadlines” contemplated by the March 14\\n\\nOrder is non-exhaustive, given that the order uses the language\\n\\n                                  16\\n “including, but not limited to[.]” Thus, a statute of repose falls within\\n\\nthe meaning of “deadlines” or “filing deadlines” tolled, suspended,\\n\\nextended, or otherwise granted relief from by the March 14 Order.\\n\\n     5. Turning to the last question, we consider whether OCGA §\\n\\n38-3-62 (a) and the COVID emergency orders can be applied to toll\\n\\nOCGA § 9-3-71 (b), consistent with the federal and Georgia\\n\\nConstitutions, in light of Tampa Tank, 316 Ga. 701.\\n\\n     In Tampa Tank, a manufacturer sued a contractor for breach\\n\\nof an express warranty after discovering problems with a tank that\\n\\nhad been installed on its premises. See id. at 701, 703. At the time\\n\\nthat the lawsuit was filed, which was ten years after installation of\\n\\nthe tank, the applicable eight-year statute of repose under OCGA §\\n\\n9-3-51 (a) had run. See id. at 713, 715-16 (2). Subsequently, the\\n\\nGeneral Assembly amended that statute of repose so as to exclude\\n\\nthe repose period from applying to actions for breach of express\\n\\ncontractual warranties. See id. at 705; Ga. L. 2020, p. 37, § 1; OCGA\\n\\n§ 9-3-51 (c). When the manufacturer tried to rely on the amendment\\n\\nto bring its breach-of-express-warranty claim, we held that the pre-\\n\\n                                   17\\n amendment eight-year repose period still applied to bar the claim,\\n\\nreasoning that the contractor had, under the Due Process Clause of\\n\\nthe federal and Georgia Constitutions, 9 a “vested right to be free\\n\\nfrom liability for [the manufacturer’s] contract claims as set out in\\n\\nthe pre-2020 version of [statute of repose].” See id. at 706 (1), 712 (1)\\n\\n(b).\\n\\n       Floyd Medical argues that applying OCGA § 38-3-62 (a) and\\n\\nthe March 14 Order to toll OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) would violate its due\\n\\nprocess rights by depriving Floyd Medical of its vested, substantive\\n\\nrights in the five-year repose statute because Floyd Medical should\\n\\nhave been able to rely on the repose statute as of the date of Golden’s\\n\\nallegedly negligent treatment in July 2016. In contrast, Golden\\n\\nargues that any vested rights that Floyd Medical had, vested only\\n\\nwhen the repose period on her medical malpractice claims (without\\n\\ntolling) would have expired—that is, in July 2021. Thus, Golden\\n\\n\\n       9 The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides\\n\\nthat no State may “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\\nprocess of law.” Paragraph I of Article I, Section I of the Georgia Constitution\\nof 1983 provides: “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property except\\nby due process of law.”\\n                                        18\\n contends the March 14 Order tolled OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) before Floyd\\n\\nMedical’s rights under the repose statute vested, and so did not\\n\\ndeprive Floyd Medical of vested rights.\\n\\n     We agree with Golden that Floyd Medical’s rights would have\\n\\nvested only when OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) would have expired on Golden’s\\n\\nmedical malpractice claims and did not vest when Golden’s allegedly\\n\\nnegligent treatment occurred. In Tampa Tank, we explained that a\\n\\ncritical part of what makes a defendant’s rights under a statute of\\n\\nrepose, vested rights, is that a statute of repose “extinguishes a\\n\\nplaintiff’s right to bring a cause of action.” See 316 Ga. at 711 (1) (b)\\n\\n(emphasis added). Indeed, only when a repose statute extinguishes\\n\\na plaintiff’s rights to bring a claim, does a defendant, in turn, have\\n\\nthe “right to be free from liability” for such a claim. See id. at 712 (1)\\n\\n(b) (“Based on the nature of a statute of repose, we conclude that a\\n\\nstatute of repose creates a substantive right in being free from\\n\\nliability for a claim after a fixed period of time and join the majority\\n\\nof jurisdictions that have reached that conclusion.” (emphasis\\n\\nadded)); Phagan v. State, 287 Ga. 856, 860 (700 SE2d 589) (2010)\\n\\n                                   19\\n (“‘The statute of repose destroys the previously existing rights so\\n\\nthat, on the expiration of the statutory period, the cause of action no\\n\\nlonger exists.’” (emphasis added; quoting Wright, 262 Ga. at 845 (1)).\\n\\nBecause the March 14 Order tolled OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) before the\\n\\nlatter would have barred Golden’s claims in July 2021, the March 14\\n\\nOrder did not deprive Floyd Medical of vested rights in violation of\\n\\ndue process. Thus, we conclude that Chief Justice Melton’s COVID\\n\\nemergency orders can be applied to toll OCGA § 9-3-71 (b) consistent\\n\\nwith the federal and Georgia Constitutions. See Tampa Tank, 316\\n\\nGa. at 712 (1) (b).\\n\\n      Judgment reversed. All the Justices concur, except Peterson,\\nP.J., and Pinson, J., disqualified.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  20\\n '),\n",

BARRON v. PRITCHETT.\\n\\n      BARNES, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      In this divorce action between Brian Barron (“Husband”) and Bembry Pritchett\\n\\n(“Wife”), Husband appeals from an order denying his motion for a new trial.\\n\\nHusband contends that the trial court erred in finding that the parties’ prenuptial\\n\\nagreement was enforceable. He further asserts that the trial court committed legal\\n\\nerror when it found that, even if the agreement were otherwise unenforceable under\\n\\nGeorgia law, it could be enforced as a matter of equity. As explained more fully below,\\n\\nwe find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in concluding the agreement is\\n\\nenforceable. Accordingly, we affirm the final judgment and decree of divorce.\\n       The record shows that the parties had a relatively lengthy romantic history that\\n\\nculminated in a brief marriage. The couple began dating in or around the fall of 2013\\n\\nand during their relationship, they had unprotected sexual intercourse on a number\\n\\nof occasions. Husband engaged in the intercourse despite his knowledge that he was\\n\\ninfected with the Type 2 Herpes Virus. Moreover, Husband failed to disclose his\\n\\ninfected status to Wife. In or around 2015, Wife discovered that she had become\\n\\ninfected with the virus, and she threatened to file both criminal and civil complaints\\n\\nagainst Husband. Husband retained an attorney to draft a settlement agreement and\\n\\nrelease with respect to Wife’s claims, and the parties executed that agreement on July\\n\\n23, 2015.\\n\\n      Under the terms of the settlement, Husband agreed to pay Wife two lump-sum\\n\\npayments of $6,000 each and bi-weekly payments of $438.46, with those payments\\n\\ncontinuing until the death of one of the parties. Additionally, Husband agreed to\\n\\nmaintain a 30-year term life insurance policy with Wife as the sole beneficiary. In\\n\\nexchange, the release portion of the agreement provided:\\n\\n      [Wife] hereby forever releases, discharges and covenants to hold\\n      harmless [Husband] . . . from any and all claims, demands, damages,\\n      punitive damages, exemplary damages, costs, expenses, attorney fees,\\n\\n\\n                                          2\\n       actions and causes of action, expenses, compensation, consequential\\n      damage or any other thing whatsoever on account of, or in any way\\n      growing out of, any and all known and unknown damages, relative to the\\n      alleged [conduct] of [Husband] [as set forth herein]. [Wife] further\\n      covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless [Husband]\\n      from the claims, if any, of any and all other persons and entities, whether\\n      named herein or not, including but not limited to, any health care\\n      providers, health care facility, corporation, authority or governmental\\n      agency, arising out of such failures. It is the intent of this agreement to\\n      release [Husband] from all further liability for such activity, and [Wife]\\n      expressly acknowledges and agrees that this indemnification agreement\\n      applies to any claims against [Husband] for any additional contribution\\n      which may be allegedly required of him as a result of the same.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      In 2019, several years after entering the settlement agreement, the parties\\n\\nmarried. Less than a week before their wedding, they entered the prenuptial\\n\\nagreement at issue. The agreement applies in the event of the dissolution of the\\n\\nmarriage. Under that agreement, both Husband and Wife waived any right they may\\n\\nhave to receive alimony or property from the other in the event of death or divorce.\\n\\nThe prenuptial agreement further provides, in relevant part, that “the parties\\n\\nspecifically acknowledge that they have fully acquainted themselves with the net\\n\\n\\n                                          3\\n worth and income . . . and assets of the other party”; that “the parties have agreed\\n\\nthat each is economically independent of the other”; and that “[e]ach party covenants\\n\\nand represents to the other that he or she has disclosed to the other the nature and\\n\\nextent of his or her various property, interest and sources of income.” Additionally,\\n\\nthe agreement affirmed that its execution would not operate to extinguish or modify\\n\\nthe 2015 settlement agreement, and that the parties intended the terms and conditions\\n\\nof that agreement to”remain of full force and effect[.]” Finally, the agreement\\n\\nrequired husband, both during the marriage and upon any dissolution of the same, to\\n\\n“maintain in full force and effect medical and dental insurance policies having the\\n\\nsame terms and benefits as presently exist for the benefit of [Wife].” The agreement\\n\\nalso required Husband to pay all costs associated with any such policies.\\n\\n      The parties separated in December 2019, two months after they married. In\\n\\nAugust 2020, husband filed the underlying complaint for divorce, in which he asserted\\n\\nthat the prenuptial agreement was void for failure to comply with the requirements of\\n\\nGeorgia law Specifically, Husband claimed that the parties’ failure to disclose to one\\n\\nanother material facts concerning their finances rendered the agreement\\n\\nunenforceable. Wife answered and sought to enforce the prenuptial agreement.\\n\\n\\n                                          4\\n       The case proceeded to a bench trial at which Wife testified that her attorney\\n\\nprepared the prenuptial agreement. At the time the couple married, Wife was\\n\\ngenerally aware of Husband’s annual income and his retirement funds. She had also\\n\\ndiscussed Husband’s debts with him, and she knew he had a home mortgage and liens\\n\\non the two trucks he owned. Wife was also necessarily aware of Husband’s monthly\\n\\nexpenses under the settlement agreement. With respect to her own assets, Wife stated\\n\\nthat when the couple married, she owned her own home with no mortgage. Other\\n\\nassets she owned included two cars, an “outdoor building” and what she described\\n\\nas “valuable furniture.” Wife was employed, but she never discussed her general\\n\\nfinances with Husband, although she could not remember whether she ever told\\n\\nHusband what funds she had in her bank accounts.\\n\\n      Husband testified that at the time he signed the prenuptial agreement, he was\\n\\naware he had a right to consult a lawyer about the same, but he chose not to do so. He\\n\\nalso confirmed that before entering the prenuptial agreement, the couple never had\\n\\nany financial discussions about debts or assets. He had, however, discussed his salary\\n\\nwith Wife at or around the time they entered the settlement agreement. When the\\n\\ncouple married, he was aware that wife had a job, but he had no knowledge of her\\n\\n\\n                                          5\\n salary. Additionally, he had no knowledge of Wife’s assets explaining that, although\\n\\nhe knew she lived in a house, he was unaware she owned it. He did not even know if\\n\\nwife had a bank account, although he assumed she did.\\n\\n      Both parties testified that Husband began paying for Wife’s health insurance\\n\\nin 2015, about the time the parties entered the settlement agreement. Husband\\n\\ndeducted the amount paid for Wife’s health insurance from the amount he otherwise\\n\\nowed her under the settlement agreement each month, and paid the balance of those\\n\\nfunds directly to Wife. Notably, however, Husband never testified that he would have\\n\\nrefused to enter the prenuptial agreement if he had more knowledge of Wife’s\\n\\nfinances. Instead, when asked why he executed the agreement, Husband responded\\n\\nthat Wife was threatening to sue him for defaulting under the settlement agreement.\\n\\nHusband further explained that the alleged default resulted from the fact that he was\\n\\nnot paying Wife the full amount owed under the settlement agreement, but was\\n\\ninstead using part of those monies to pay for her health insurance.\\n\\n      After hearing the evidence and receiving briefs on the legal issues, the trial court\\n\\nentered its final judgment and decree of divorce, in which it found the prenuptial\\n\\nagreement enforceable. In doing so, the court acknowledged that the evidence at trial\\n\\n\\n                                           6\\n established that financial documentation was not attached to the prenuptial\\n\\nagreement, and that the parties never discussed the particulars of their financial\\n\\nsituations. The court further noted, however, that the parties “had become familiar\\n\\nwith their respective standards of living over the course of years, [and] had operated\\n\\nunder the existing settlement agreement for years.” The court also considered the fact\\n\\nthat “[Husband] made no attempt to discover any additional information regarding\\n\\n[Wife’s] financial situation or to obtain additional relevant information.” Additionally,\\n\\nthe court concluded that those things about which Husband alleged he had no\\n\\nknowledge, including “debts, credit card accounts, or specific income, had no bearing\\n\\non [Husband’s] decision to sign the [prenuptial] agreement.” The court therefore\\n\\nconcluded that the agreement was not “obtained through the nondisclosure of\\n\\nmaterial facts.” The court further found that even if the prenuptial agreement could\\n\\notherwise be considered invalid under Georgia law, those provisions relating to the\\n\\nHusband paying for Wife’s health insurance and referencing the parties’ prior\\n\\nsettlement agreement should be enforced as a matter of equity, based on Husband’s\\n\\nconduct in infecting wife with an incurable disease. Thus, the court incorporated the\\n\\nprenuptial agreement into the final judgment and decree.\\n\\n\\n                                            7\\n       Following entry of judgment, Husband filed a motion for a new trial, which the\\n\\ntrial court denied. Husband then filed an application for discretionary appeal, which\\n\\nthis Court granted. This appeal followed.\\n\\n      In Scherer v. Scherer, \\n249 Ga. 635\\n (\\n292 SE2d 662\\n) (1982), the Supreme Court\\n\\nof Georgia established a three-part test to be employed in determining whether a\\n\\nprenuptial agreement is enforceable. Under that test, the trial court must determine:\\n\\n(1) whether “the agreement [was] obtained through fraud, duress or mistake, or\\n\\nthrough misrepresentation or nondisclosure of material facts”; (2) whether “the\\n\\nagreement [is] unconscionable”; and (3) whether “the facts and circumstances [have]\\n\\nchanged since the agreement was executed, so as to make its enforcement unfair and\\n\\nunreasonable.” \\nId. at 641\\n (3). “Whether an agreement is enforceable in light of these\\n\\ncriteria is a decision made in the trial court’s sound discretion.” Alexander v.\\n\\nAlexander, \\n279 Ga. 116\\n, 117 (\\n610 SE2d 48\\n) (2005). On appeal, therefore, “we review\\n\\nthe trial court’s legal holdings de novo, and we uphold the trial court’s factual findings\\n\\nas long as . . . there is some evidence in the record to support them.” (Citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted.) Dodson v. Dodson, \\n298 Ga. 117\\n, 118 (\\n779 SE2d 638\\n) (2015).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            8\\n       The burden is on the party seeking enforcement of a prenuptial agreement to\\n\\ndemonstrate that all three prongs of the Scherer test are satisfied. Lawrence v. Lawrence,\\n\\n286 Ga. 309\\n, 312 (4) (\\n687 SE2d 421\\n) (2009). Husband contends that the trial court\\n\\nerred in finding that Wife’s evidence satisfied that the first prong of the Scherer test.\\n\\nTo meet her evidentiary burden, Wife was required to show that there was no\\n\\n“misrepresentation or nondisclosure of a material fact,” Alexander, \\n279 Ga. at 118\\n,\\n\\nand “that the party opposing enforcement entered into the agreement freely,\\n\\nvoluntarily, and with full understanding of its terms after being offered the\\n\\nopportunity to consult with independent counsel.” (Citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted.) Lawrence, \\n286 Ga. at 313\\n (4).\\n\\n      Although the trial court acknowledged that Wife had failed to disclose her\\n\\nassets to Husband prior to the execution of the prenuptial agreement, the court\\n\\nnevertheless held that Wife satisfied the first prong of Scherer. To support this\\n\\nholding, the trial court relied on: (1) the fact that the parties “had become familiar\\n\\nwith their respective standards of living” over the course of their years-long\\n\\nrelationship; ; (2) Husband’s failure to make any effort “to discover additional\\n\\ninformation regarding [Wife’s] financial situation or to obtain other relevant\\n\\n\\n                                            9\\n additional information”; and (3) the fact that Husband’s lack of knowledge as to\\n\\nWife’s assets “had no bearing on [Husband’s] decision to sign the . . . agreement.”\\n\\nPut another way, the court found that Wife’s assets were not a material fact that\\n\\naffected Husband’s decision to enter into the prenuptial agreement. On appeal,\\n\\nHusband challenges each of these conclusions.\\n\\n       We agree with Husband that relevant precedent does not support the trial\\n\\ncourt’s reliance on each party’s familiarity with the other’s standard of living as a\\n\\nsubstitute for full disclosure of a party’s finances. See Dodson, \\n298 Ga. at 118-119\\n (first\\n\\nprong of Scherer not satisfied where, although prenuptial agreement listed “all of\\n\\nHusband’s assets, it contain[ed] no values for [those] assets — including the value of\\n\\nHusband’s bank accounts and two closely-held businesses owned by him”). Cf.\\n\\nMallen v. Mallen, \\n280 Ga. 43\\n, 47 (1) (\\n622 SE2d 812\\n) (2005) (affirming enforcement of\\n\\nprenuptial agreement where, although husband’s financial statement did not include\\n\\nincome, “it did reveal Husband to be a wealthy individual with significant\\n\\nincome-producing assets, including an 80% ownership share of the business bearing\\n\\nhis name[,]” and having lived with husband for four years prior to marriage, wife knew\\n\\nfrom their standard of living that husband had significant income from his business).\\n\\n\\n                                            10\\n       We also agree with Husband that the trial court erred as a matter of law in\\n\\nfinding that he had an obligation to seek information about Wife’s finances. Our\\n\\nSupreme Court has made clear “that Scherer imposes an affirmative duty of full and\\n\\nfair disclosure of all material facts on parties entering into an [prenuptial] agreement.”\\n\\nBlige v. Blige, \\n283 Ga. 65\\n, 70 (2) (\\n656 SE2d 822\\n) (2008). See also Lawrence, \\n286 Ga.\\n\\nat 313\\n (4) (“Georgia law, like that of virtually every other state, imposes an affirmative\\n\\nduty of pre-execution disclosure on parties to [a prenuptial] agreement.”). And “in\\n\\nthe absence of a full and fair disclosure, the other spouse does not have a general duty\\n\\nto investigate the assets of the other party.” Dodson, \\n298 Ga. at 119\\n.\\n\\n      As to the first prong of Scherer, however, the question is not whether there was\\n\\na misrepresentation of or a failure to disclose financial information. The question is\\n\\ninstead a broader one. Specifically, Scherer requires a trial court to determine whether\\n\\nthere has been a “full and fair disclosure of all material facts [by the] parties entering\\n\\ninto [a prenuptial] agreement.” (Emphasis supplied.) Blige, \\n283 Ga. at 70\\n (2). See also\\n\\nAlexander, \\n279 Ga. at 118\\n (“[t]he question before the court was whether there was a\\n\\nmisrepresentation or nondisclosure of a material fact,” and where the issue was\\n\\nwhether wife had knowingly waived her rights to receive any of husband’s property,\\n\\n\\n                                            11\\n the value of that property constituted a material fact); Dodson, \\n298 Ga. at 118-119\\n\\n\\n(same); Blige, \\n283 Ga. at 69-72\\n (2) (same). And as a general rule, it is for the trial court\\n\\nto determine which facts are material to the prenuptial agreement at issue. Alexander,\\n\\n279 Ga. at 117-118\\n.\\n\\n       Here, some evidence, including Husband’s own testimony as to his reasons for\\n\\nentering the prenuptial agreement, supports the trial court’s finding that, under the\\n\\ncircumstances of this case, Wife’s finances did not constitute material information.\\n\\nAccordingly, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that\\n\\nWife satisfied the first prong of Scherer and in concluding that the prenuptial\\n\\nagreement was enforceable.

ZEP,\\n     INC.\\n\\n      GOBEIL, Judge.\\n\\n      At issue in these three appeals is the interpretation and interplay of the Georgia\\n\\nInsurers Insolvency Pool Act, OCGA § 33-36-1 et seq. (the “Pool Act”) and\\n\\nGeorgia’s Workers’ Compensation Act, OCGA § 34-9-1 et seq. (the “WCA”).1\\n\\nSpecifically, in the context of a compensable workers’ compensation claim, these\\n\\n\\n\\n      1\\n        Although Case No. A24A0287 is otherwise unrelated to A24A0103 and\\nA24A0211, we heard these cases together. All three involve the same core issues\\nregarding the Pool Act.\\n appeals require us to address the Georgia Insurers Insolvency Pool’s (the “Pool”)\\n\\nright to reimbursement from the solvent insurer of a business utilizing the services of\\n\\na staffing company when the staffing company’s insurer has become insolvent.\\n\\n                           Summary of the Cases Presented\\n\\n      Briefly, as relevant to Case No. A24A0287, Jeffrey Ward sustained a\\n\\ncompensable injury in July 2017. On the date of his injury, Ward was employed by\\n\\nNorth Georgia Staffing, Inc. (“NGS”), a temporary staffing company, and NGS had\\n\\nassigned him to work at a warehouse owned and operated by Zep, Inc. (“Zep”).\\n\\nNGS’s workers’ compensation insurer, Guarantee Insurance Company\\n\\n(“Guarantee”), accepted the claim as compensable and commenced payment of\\n\\nmedical and indemnity benefits. After Guarantee was declared insolvent, the Pool\\n\\nassumed responsibility for Ward’s claim as required by OCGA § 33-36-14 of the Pool\\n\\nAct. The Pool then sought reimbursement for all amounts it had paid toward Ward’s\\n\\nclaim from Zep’s still-solvent insurer, New Hampshire Insurance Company\\n\\n(“NHIC”).\\n\\n      The matter proceeded to a hearing before an administrative law judge (“ALJ”)\\n\\nwith the State Board of Workers’ Compensation (the “Board”). The ALJ ruled that\\n\\n\\n                                          2\\n the Pool was not entitled to reimbursement from NHIC. The Board’s Appellate\\n\\nDivision affirmed this ruling, and the Superior Court of Bartow County likewise\\n\\naffirmed the conclusion that the Pool was not entitled to reimbursement from NHIC.\\n\\nOn appeal, the Pool argues that the superior court erred by (1) applying an “any\\n\\nevidence” standard to the Appellate Division’s conclusions of law; (2) deferring to\\n\\nthe Appellate Division’s “flawed” interpretation of the Pool Act; (3) failing to\\n\\nconsider Zep’s liability as a statutory employer (OCGA § 34-9-11 (c)); (4) interpreting\\n\\nthe Pool Act in a way that would permit businesses to enter into contracts that\\n\\ncontravene the Pool Act’s requirements; and (5) failing to apply the correct test to\\n\\ndetermine whether Ward was a borrowed servant of Zep at the time of his injury;\\n\\n      As relevant to Case Nos. A24A0103 and A24A0211, Jay Hall sustained a work-\\n\\nrelated injury in 2010 while performing work for Carpet Cycle, LLC (“Carpet\\n\\nCycle”). At the time, he was employed by Aliyah Personnel, Inc. (“Aliyah”), a\\n\\ntemporary staffing company that provided workers for companies including Carpet\\n\\nCycle. Aliyah’s insurer, Lumbermen’s Underwriting Alliance (“Lumbermen’s”),\\n\\npaid medical and indemnity benefits on Hall’s workers’ compensation claim. In 2016,\\n\\nLumbermen’s underwent liquidation, and the Pool took over administration of Hall’s\\n\\n\\n                                           3\\n claim. The Pool then sought reimbursement from Carpet Cycle and its still-solvent\\n\\ninsurer, Rochdale Insurance Company (“Rochdale”).\\n\\n      An ALJ with the Board denied the Pool’s request for reimbursement, and the\\n\\nAppellate Division and the Superior Court of Gordon County affirmed this denial. In\\n\\nCase No. A24A0103, the Pool appeals, raising the same arguments it raised in Case\\n\\nNo. A24A0287. In addition, the Pool argues that the superior court erred by finding\\n\\nthat the date of injury, rather than the date of insolvency, controls the analysis of\\n\\nHall’s employment status for purposes of the Pool Act.\\n\\n      In Case No. A24A0211, Carpet Cycle/Rochdale have filed a cross-appeal from\\n\\nthe superior court’s order, arguing that the Pool Act, as applied, is unconstitutional,\\n\\nand the superior court should have considered whether the Pool Act violates Carpet\\n\\nCycle/Rochdale’s constitutional rights to due process and access to the courts.\\n\\n      As explained more fully below, we affirm in Case No. A24A0287. In Case No.,\\n\\nA24A0103, we affirm in part and reverse in part, and we agree with the Pool that the\\n\\nBoard applied the wrong test in determining whether Hall was Carpet Cycle’s\\n\\nborrowed servant at the time of his work injury. However, as relevant to Carpet\\n\\nCycle/Rochdale’s cross-appeal in Case No. A24A0211, we remand the case to the\\n\\n\\n                                          4\\n superior court for a determination of the constitutional issues raised but not ruled\\n\\nupon.\\n\\n                                   Standard of Review\\n\\n              In reviewing a workers’ compensation award, this Court must\\n        construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing\\n        before the appellate division. In addition, the findings of the Board, when\\n        supported by any evidence, are conclusive and binding, and neither the\\n        superior court nor this Court may substitute itself as a factfinding body\\n        in lieu of the State Board. But erroneous applications of law to\\n        undisputed facts, as well as decisions based on erroneous theories of law,\\n        are subject to a de novo standard of review.\\n\\n\\nCho v.

THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n      MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n      Appellant Justin Christopher Gold was convicted of malice\\n\\nmurder in relation to the stabbing death of Antonio DePass.1 On\\n\\nappeal, Gold argues that the trial court erred in charging the jury\\n\\non excessive force and that his trial counsel rendered ineffective\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 DePass died on September 11, 2018.      On November 15, 2018, a DeKalb\\nCounty grand jury indicted Gold for malice murder (Count 1), felony murder\\n(Count 2), aggravated assault (Count 3), and possession of a knife during the\\ncommission of a felony (Count 4). At a trial from November 8 through 16, 2021,\\na jury found Gold guilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced Gold to life in\\nprison without the possibility of parole for malice murder, plus a consecutive\\nfive years in prison for the weapon charge. The felony murder count was\\nvacated by operation of law, and the aggravated assault count merged for\\nsentencing purposes.\\n       Gold filed a timely motion for new trial on November 17, 2021, which\\nwas amended by new counsel on July 28, 2023. Following a hearing on August\\n2, 2023, the trial court denied Gold’s motion for new trial, as amended, on\\nOctober 10, 2023, except the trial court modified the sentence on Count 1 to\\nlife in prison with the possibility of parole. Gold filed a timely notice of appeal\\non November 1, 2023, and the case was docketed to the April term of this Court\\nand thereafter submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n assistance by failing to object to evidence of DePass’s good character\\n\\nor to a detective’s testimony about whether Gold’s conduct was\\n\\nconsistent with an assertion of self-defense. For the reasons that\\n\\nfollow, we affirm.\\n\\n     The evidence at trial showed that on the afternoon of\\n\\nSeptember 11, 2018, as a resident arrived home at the Covington\\n\\nGlenn Apartment Complex and pulled into her parking spot, she\\n\\nsaw a man lying face-down in a pool of blood in the grass nearby, so\\n\\nshe called 911. Officers with the DeKalb County Police Department\\n\\narrived on the scene, where they found a dead body, later identified\\n\\nas DePass, with wounds to the face, neck, and shoulder. Officers\\n\\nfound DePass’s car nearby, still running, with a trail of blood leading\\n\\nfrom the driver’s side of the car to DePass’s body.\\n\\n     An Uber driver also saw DePass’s body, called 911, and spoke\\n\\nwith officers when they arrived. She explained during her 911 call\\n\\nthat she had received a request to pick up a rider from the\\n\\napartment complex, and when she arrived, she saw the body. She\\n\\nalso interacted with the man who had requested the ride, but she\\n\\n                                  2\\n cancelled his ride because he was “acting really strange” and “trying\\n\\nto rush [her] off,” but she “didn’t feel comfortable leaving.” When\\n\\nofficers arrived on scene and spoke with the Uber driver, she\\n\\nprovided a physical description of the man who had requested the\\n\\nride; the email address associated with the rider’s Uber account,\\n\\nwhich included the name “jgold”; and the address where he had\\n\\nrequested to be taken.\\n\\n     Based on this information, an officer conducted surveillance on\\n\\nthat address, where he observed a person matching the description\\n\\ngiven by the Uber driver exit the home while carrying a red bag and\\n\\nride away in the passenger side of a vehicle. The officer conducted\\n\\na traffic stop on the vehicle, and the passenger, Gold, was non-\\n\\ncompliant, yelled at the officer to shoot him and kill him, and tried\\n\\nto flee as he was being arrested. The bag Gold carried contained a\\n\\nbloody knife, and DNA testing confirmed the blood on the knife to be\\n\\nDePass’s.\\n\\n     Gold was arrested and transported to the police department\\n\\nwhere he waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436\\n\\n                                 3\\n (86 SCt 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966), and was interviewed by\\n\\nDetective Bryan Smith. The interview was audio-recorded. During\\n\\nthe interview, Gold initially stated that DePass was coming to meet\\n\\nhim to give him money but that when Gold came outside, he found\\n\\nDePass already dead, after which Gold picked up the knife from the\\n\\nground; Gold also said that he noticed another person sitting in the\\n\\npassenger seat of DePass’s car.       After being challenged on this\\n\\nversion of events, Gold admitted that he and DePass had argued\\n\\nover the money, but Gold maintained that he did not stab DePass.\\n\\nGold said that DePass arrived at the apartment complex and Gold\\n\\ngreeted him, but that Gold then went inside to change and when he\\n\\ncame back out, he found DePass on the ground bleeding; Gold\\n\\nmaintained that another person was sitting in DePass’s vehicle.\\n\\nLater, another detective spoke to Gold, and at that time, Gold asked\\n\\n“can I please just kill myself?”, before admitting that he stabbed\\n\\nDePass, stating that DePass pulled a knife on him and swung it at\\n\\nhim, so Gold took it from DePass, and then Gold stabbed DePass\\n\\nbecause “I was trying to defend myself and I was mad that he did\\n\\n                                  4\\n that.”\\n\\n     The medical examiner who performed DePass’s autopsy\\n\\ntestified that DePass suffered “probably 20 different cuts on his\\n\\nface,” and a “fatal” stab wound to his shoulder that severed his aorta\\n\\nand trachea, causing massive blood loss and blood aspiration; the\\n\\nmedical examiner ruled DePass’s death a homicide. DePass’s sister\\n\\ntestified at trial that shortly before DePass’s death, Gold had\\n\\ncontacted their mother about money that DePass owed him. During\\n\\ntheir investigation, law enforcement officers also discovered text\\n\\nmessages sent between Gold and DePass on September 11, 2018,\\n\\nabout settling a drug debt; in those messages, DePass expressed\\n\\nanger about Gold contacting DePass’s mother regarding the debt.\\n\\n     1.    Gold contends that the trial court erred in charging the\\n\\njury on excessive force.2 More precisely, Gold argues that because\\n\\n\\n\\n     2 The trial court charged the jury:\\n\\n     A defendant is not justified in using excessive force while acting in\\n     self-defense. If you decide that the defendant used more force than\\n     was reasonably necessary to defend against the alleged victim’s\\n     threats or use of force, then the defendant’s actions would not be\\n     justified.\\n\\n                                      5\\n he—who provided the only direct evidence about what happened\\n\\nduring the altercation between himself and DePass—claimed that\\n\\nhe acted in response to DePass attacking him with the knife, there\\n\\nwas no evidence that DePass used anything less than deadly force,\\n\\nmaking it confusing and misleading to charge the jury on excessive\\n\\nforce.\\n\\n     Gold objected to the excessive force charge at the charge\\n\\nconference and renewed his objection after the trial court charged\\n\\nthe jury, so the issue is preserved for ordinary review on appeal.\\n\\nWynn v. State, 313 Ga. 827, 839 (5) (874 SE2d 42) (2022). “When\\n\\ndetermining whether a charge is erroneous, we look to the charges\\n\\ngiven as a whole.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted). “Jury\\n\\ninstructions must tell the jury the law of the case fully and fairly\\n\\nand are authorized if supported by slight evidence.” Bowman v.\\n\\nState, 317 Ga. 457, 463 (2) (b) (893 SE2d 735) (2023) (citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n\\nSee Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instruction, Vol. II: Criminal Cases §\\n3.16.20.\\n\\n                                   6\\n      The trial court provided the full suggested pattern jury\\n\\ninstructions on self-defense, including that “[a] defendant is justified\\n\\nin using force that is intended or likely to cause death or serious\\n\\nbodily injury when he reasonably believes that the use of such force\\n\\nis necessary to prevent a death or serious bodily injury to himself or\\n\\nthe commission of a forcible felony, which means a felony that\\n\\ninvolves the use of force or violence against another”; “[t]he State\\n\\nhas the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the\\n\\nDefendant’s actions were not justified”; and “a person who is not the\\n\\naggressor is not required to retreat before being justified in using\\n\\nforce he or she reasonably believes to be necessary.” See Georgia\\n\\nSuggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases §\\n\\n3.10.10; 3.10.13.\\n\\n     These charges were a correct statement of the law, see OCGA\\n\\n§§ 16-3-20 (1); 16-3-21 (a); 16-3-23.1, and, given the evidence\\n\\npresented, the trial court did not err in also giving the suggested\\n\\npattern jury instruction on excessive force as part of its broader\\n\\ninstructions on self-defense. Although Gold claimed that DePass\\n\\n                                   7\\n pulled the knife on him and that Gold was defending himself in\\n\\ndisarming DePass, the jury was not required to believe this account,\\n\\nparticularly in light of Gold’s conflicting stories about the stabbing.\\n\\nMoreover, Gold inflicted some 20 knife wounds upon DePass, which\\n\\nwas at least slight evidence that the force Gold used was excessive.\\n\\nSee Wynn, 313 Ga. at 838-40 (5) (holding that trial court’s self-\\n\\ndefense charge, which included charge on excessive force, “when\\n\\nviewed as a whole, was proper” where the only evidence about the\\n\\nsequence of events leading to the deceased’s death came from the\\n\\ndefendant’s testimony that the deceased was the initial aggressor\\n\\nand was going to kill him); Welbon v. State, 278 Ga. 312, 312 (1), 313\\n\\n(3) (602 SE2d 610) (2004) (explaining that “[t]his Court has held that\\n\\nthe [excessive force] charge, which comes from the Suggested\\n\\nPattern Jury Instructions, is a correct statement of the law, and it\\n\\nwas proper in light of the entire justification charge given,” where\\n\\ndefendant claimed that he shot the deceased four to six times in self-\\n\\ndefense because she was reaching for a gun (citations omitted)); see\\n\\nalso Jackson v. State, 317 Ga. 139, 144 (1) (891 SE2d 878) (2023)\\n\\n                                  8\\n (“[E]ven if [the deceased] was the initial aggressor as [the defendant]\\n\\nclaimed, a jury could easily reject his self-defense claim given that\\n\\n[the defendant] brutally and repeated[ly] stabbed [the victim].”).\\n\\nAccordingly, this enumeration of error fails.\\n\\n        2.   Gold also asserts that his trial counsel rendered\\n\\nineffective assistance by failing to object (a) to improper evidence of\\n\\nDePass’s good character from the testimony of DePass’s sister and\\n\\n(b) to testimony of Detective Smith that opined that Gold’s actions\\n\\nwere not consistent with an assertion of self-defense. These claims\\n\\nfail.\\n\\n        To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Gold\\n\\nmust show both that his counsel’s performance was deficient and\\n\\nthat such deficiency prejudiced his defense. See Strickland v.\\n\\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (III) (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674)\\n\\n(1984). To satisfy the deficiency prong, Gold must demonstrate that\\n\\nhis counsel “performed at trial in an objectively unreasonable way\\n\\nconsidering all the circumstances and in the light of prevailing\\n\\nprofessional norms.” Bacon v. State, 316 Ga. 234, 239 (3) (887 SE2d\\n\\n                                    9\\n 263) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). In doing so, Gold\\n\\nmust overcome “[a] strong presumption . . . that trial counsel’s\\n\\nperformance was reasonable and that counsel’s decisions and\\n\\nchoices at trial fell within the broad range of professional conduct as\\n\\nassessed from counsel’s perspective at the time of trial and under\\n\\nthe specific circumstances of the case.” Id. (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). To establish prejudice, Gold “must prove that there is a\\n\\nreasonable probability that, but for his trial counsel’s deficiency, the\\n\\nresult of the trial would have been different.” Bates v. State, 313 Ga.\\n\\n57, 62 (2) (867 SE2d 140) (2022).       And if Gold fails to make a\\n\\nsufficient showing on either the deficiency or the prejudice prong,\\n\\nwe need not address the other prong. See Washington v. State, 313\\n\\nGa. 771, 773 (3) (873 SE2d 132) (2022).\\n\\n     (a)   Gold argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective\\n\\nassistance by failing to object under OCGA §§ 24-4-404 (character\\n\\nevidence) and 24-6-608 (character and conduct of witness) to\\n\\nDePass’s sister’s trial testimony, in response to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nquestion “can you tell the jury just a little about who your brother\\n\\n                                  10\\n was as a person?,” that “Antoine was the life of the party, the nice\\n\\nguy. He was always willing to help someone,” and “[h]e was a great\\n\\ndad.”\\n\\n        We recognize that “reasonable decisions as to whether to raise\\n\\na specific objection are ordinarily matters of trial strategy and\\n\\nprovide no ground for reversal,” Clements v. State, 317 Ga. 772, 798\\n\\n(7) (c) (896 SE2d 549) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted), and\\n\\nthat an attorney in the position of Gold’s trial counsel may\\n\\nreasonably choose not to object to certain evidence even if it is\\n\\nobjectionable, particularly where, as here, DePass’s sister’s\\n\\ncomments were fleeting and counsel may not have wanted to\\n\\nantagonize a sympathetic witness. See, e.g., Moore v. State, 315 Ga.\\n\\n263, 268-69 (2) (c) (882 SE2d 227) (2022) (counsel acted reasonably\\n\\nin not objecting to victim’s grieving mother’s testimony that victim\\n\\nwas “a ‘good kid’ and a good older brother,” as trial counsel “might\\n\\nvery well have wanted to avoid the appearance of attacking a grief-\\n\\nstricken witness”); Kilpatrick v. State, 276 Ga. 151, 152-53 (2) (575\\n\\nSE2d 478) (2003) (counsel acted reasonably in not objecting to non-\\n\\n                                   11\\n crucial testimony of victim’s mother to avoid appearing insensitive).\\n\\nHowever, we need not decide whether counsel’s failure to object to\\n\\nthis allegedly improper good character evidence fell within the broad\\n\\nrange of professional conduct because Gold has not carried his\\n\\nburden of proving a reasonable probability that had his trial counsel\\n\\nsuccessfully objected to DePass’s sister’s brief positive comments\\n\\nabout her brother, the result of Gold’s trial would have been\\n\\ndifferent.\\n\\n     As the trial court observed in its order denying Gold’s motion\\n\\nfor new trial, it is unlikely the jury was surprised to hear DePass’s\\n\\nsister remember her deceased brother fondly. Moreover, despite\\n\\nGold’s argument on appeal that this testimony was detrimental to\\n\\nhis claim that DePass was the initial aggressor, DePass’s sister’s\\n\\ntestimony did not touch on whether DePass had a character of\\n\\npeacefulness and thus provided little, if any, rebuttal to Gold’s claim\\n\\nthat DePass attacked him first.        Cf. OCGA § 24-4-404 (a) (2)\\n\\n(“[E]vidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the alleged victim”\\n\\nmay be “offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut\\n\\n                                  12\\n evidence that the alleged victim was the first aggressor.”). Finally,\\n\\naside from the complained-of testimony, the evidence of Gold’s guilt\\n\\nwas strong. This evidence included Gold’s admission that he stabbed\\n\\nDePass, Gold’s possession of the murder weapon, his leaving the\\n\\nscene without calling for any aid for DePass, the several changing\\n\\nversions of events he told police, his statement that he stabbed\\n\\nDePass, in part, because he was mad at DePass, evidence that\\n\\nDePass suffered about 20 different cuts on his face in addition to the\\n\\nfatal stab wound, evidence of motive regarding a money debt\\n\\nbetween the two men, and Gold’s erratic behavior after the killing\\n\\nin attempting to flee and repeatedly expressing a desire to die\\n\\nhimself. See, e.g., Clements, 317 Ga. at 798 (7) (c) (“Even if [a\\n\\nwitness’s] testimony was improper character evidence that should\\n\\nhave been excluded . . . the admission of this testimony did not\\n\\nprejudice [defendant’s] defense given the other compelling evidence\\n\\n[of guilt].”); Ingram v.

IN THE MATTER OF SUSAN MICHELE BROWN.\\n\\n        PER CURIAM.\\n\\n        This disciplinary matter is before the Court on the petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline filed by Respondent Susan Brown (State Bar\\n\\nNo. 090043) before the issuance of a formal complaint. See Bar Rule\\n\\n4-227 (b). In the petition, Brown, who has been a member of the\\n\\nState Bar of Georgia since 1997, admits that she “may have” violated\\n\\nRules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) of the Georgia Rules of Professional\\n\\nConduct (“GRPC”) while serving as the successor trustee of a South\\n\\nCarolina trust—even though the Bar acknowledges that she was\\n\\nacting only in a fiduciary capacity, and not as a lawyer, at the time.1\\n\\n\\n        1 Brown admits that she “was not acting as an attorney in her capacity\\n\\nas the successor trustee,” but that she was acting as a “fiduciary, and that as\\nsuch, her conduct may be a violation of” Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b). Pet.\\nVoluntary Discipline at 6. Brown is willing to accept discipline up to and\\n The Bar asserts that Brown violated Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II)\\n\\n(b) and requests a suspension of between three and six months.\\n\\n      We ultimately conclude that Brown’s conduct did not violate\\n\\nRule 1.15 (I) (c) or 1.15 (II) (b). As we explain below, the text of Rules\\n\\n1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) does not clearly indicate whether these\\n\\nRules apply to lawyers when they are acting as fiduciaries not in\\n\\nconnection with the legal representation of a client or otherwise in\\n\\nthe practice of law.        Even after applying rules of statutory\\n\\nconstruction, either reading of Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b)—\\n\\nthat they do, or do not, apply to lawyers acting as fiduciaries but\\n\\nwho are not engaged in legal representation of a client or in the\\n\\npractice of law—is plausible. However, applying these Rules to\\n\\nlawyers when they are not practicing law would raise serious\\n\\nconstitutional concerns, which we set out below. As a result, under\\n\\nthe canon of constitutional doubt, we interpret Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and\\n\\n1.15 (II) (b) such that they do not apply to lawyers when they are\\n\\n\\n\\nincluding a suspension of between one to six months if her conduct did violate\\nRules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b). Id. at 7, 10.\\n\\n                                      2\\n acting as fiduciaries not in connection with the legal representation\\n\\nof a client or otherwise in the practice of law. Because Brown’s\\n\\nconduct at issue in this matter falls outside our interpretation of\\n\\nRules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b), we conclude that Brown’s conduct\\n\\ndid not violate those Rules. We therefore reject her petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline.\\n\\n     1. Admitted Facts\\n\\n     In her petition, Brown explains that MBJ is a beneficiary of\\n\\ntwo trusts: one created in 2014 by MBJ’s father’s Last Will and\\n\\nTestament (“Trust under Will”) and one created in 1999 by her\\n\\nfather’s Irrevocable Trust (“MBJ Trust”) (collectively, “Trusts”).\\n\\nBoth Trusts were created under the laws of South Carolina and JJW\\n\\n(MBJ’s sister) was a successor trustee for both Trusts prior to Brown\\n\\ntaking over that role. Brown did not draft the will or either of the\\n\\nTrusts and did not serve as a lawyer for the Trusts, the trustee, or\\n\\nany beneficiary in prior litigation undertaken to revise the terms of\\n\\nthe Trusts so that an individual could serve as a successor trustee.\\n\\nIn 2018, MBJ expressed concern about JJW’s handling of the Trusts\\n\\n                                  3\\n and requested that JJW resign as the trustee over MBJ’s two Trusts.\\n\\nAt that point, Brown was contacted and asked if she would consider\\n\\nacting as successor trustee for the Trusts, and she agreed to do so\\n\\nfor a fee and in her “individual capacity,” rather than as a lawyer as\\n\\nshe was not licensed to practice law in South Carolina.2 JJW agreed\\n\\nto those terms and filed, through her counsel, a motion to appoint\\n\\nBrown as successor trustee. On September 24, 2018, the court\\n\\ngranted the motion.\\n\\n     Brown promptly established separate Trust banking accounts\\n\\nto receive the Trusts’ financial assets. JJW transferred funds into\\n\\nthese respective accounts both initially and as other non-cash assets\\n\\nwere sold. During Brown’s term as trustee, she disbursed funds for\\n\\nthe benefit of MBJ as permitted under the Trusts (i.e., rent,\\n\\nallowance, medical treatment, utilities, debts, vehicle, etc.); made\\n\\ndisbursements directly to third-party vendors or by cash, check or\\n\\nwire transfer into MBJ’s personal bank accounts, as MBJ requested;\\n\\n\\n     2 It is undisputed that Brown is not licensed to practice law in South\\n\\nCarolina, and nothing in the Bar’s filings in this case claims that Brown was\\nengaged in the unauthorized practice of law in South Carolina.\\n\\n                                     4\\n and made investments as permitted under the terms of the Trusts,\\n\\nincluding the purchase and sale of securities and real property.\\n\\nBrown asserts that the purchase and sale of real estate was done\\n\\nwith MBJ’s knowledge; was consistent with the prior trustee’s\\n\\ninvestment strategy; and was permitted under the terms of the\\n\\nTrusts.\\n\\n     Brown discussed with MBJ and the person then holding MBJ’s\\n\\npower of attorney their interest in pursuing opportunities for\\n\\ninvestments in the Bahamas and U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”).\\n\\nBrown’s daughter, who lived in the USVI, presented an opportunity\\n\\nfor her to purchase a house that had sustained hurricane damage\\n\\nfor a reduced price.     Brown, who contends that the Trust\\n\\nInstruments allowed for debt as an investment vehicle, investigated\\n\\nthe property and believed that a loan would be a sound investment\\n\\nfor the Trusts given the then-existing interest rates. According to\\n\\nBrown, the terms of the Trusts allowed for loans and contained no\\n\\nprohibitions as to the relationship between the borrower and the\\n\\ntrustee. Brown obtained a promissory note for the Trust’s benefit\\n\\n                                5\\n with an interest rate of 10% for a principal sum of $179,000—though\\n\\nshe later realized that the promissory note did not state the correct\\n\\namount of the debt, which she says should have been $188,900—and\\n\\nhad the funds transferred via wire directly to the closing attorney\\n\\nfor her daughter’s purchase of the property in the USVI.3              She\\n\\nasserts that the error was unintentional but admits that because of\\n\\nthe mistake, she had not secured the distributions from the Trust\\n\\nwith a note that accurately reflected the terms of the loan.\\n\\n      Several months later, after differences arose between JJW,\\n\\nMBJ, and a third sister, JJW filed a petition to alter, amend, or\\n\\nremove Brown as successor trustee of the Trusts and a hearing was\\n\\nset for November 7, 2019. In response, Brown voluntarily filed an\\n\\naffidavit of resignation, which the South Carolina probate court\\n\\naccepted. Brown contends that she was released from attending the\\n\\nhearing, which she was told would be cancelled in any event. But\\n\\nJJW’s counsel went forward with the hearing and, as a result, an\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 Brown says that she made this realization when she began preparing a\\n\\n“response to the Bar.”\\n\\n                                     6\\n order was entered, which barred Brown from having any further\\n\\naccess to the Trusts’ accounts; appointed a new Special Trustee; and\\n\\ndirected that Brown provide a full accounting by November 21, 2019.\\n\\nBrown asserts that she could not complete the accounting in that\\n\\nshort of a time frame, partly because she had been locked out of the\\n\\nTrusts’ electronic accounts and retained no paper records of those\\n\\naccounts and partly because of her own health issues and those of\\n\\nher ailing mother. Therefore, she obtained an extension through\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2020, but she also missed that deadline because of what\\n\\nshe characterizes as a “distress[ed]” emotional state related to\\n\\nhealth concerns, and also because she was missing some of the\\n\\nfinancial records she had requested but had not yet received. At a\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2020 hearing in the South Carolina probate court,\\n\\nBrown was held in contempt but given another 30 days in which to\\n\\nprovide the full accounting. To help her prepare the full accounting,\\n\\nBrown hired her own South Carolina counsel, “secured at her own\\n\\nexpense.” Brown provided the full accounting in April 2020, with\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 7\\n the assistance of her South Carolina counsel, and she asserts that\\n\\nher final accounting has not been challenged.\\n\\n     According to Brown, the promissory note related to the USVI\\n\\nproperty did not come due prior to Brown’s withdrawal as successor\\n\\ntrustee, and the Special Trustee made no effort to enforce the note.\\n\\nNevertheless, after discussion with the newly-appointed Special\\n\\nTrustee, a mortgage was obtained on Brown’s daughter’s USVI\\n\\nproperty and the funds were sent to Brown’s South Carolina counsel\\n\\nto hold pending a written agreement with the Trust. No further\\n\\naction was taken in the South Carolina probate court matter, and\\n\\nthe parties have since entered into a written, confidential settlement\\n\\nagreement resolving all issues, including compliance with the\\n\\nprobate court’s November 7, 2019 and February 27, 2020 orders, as\\n\\nwell as responsibility for attorney fees. Brown asserts that, as part\\n\\nof the settlement agreement, the Trusts have been fully restored as\\n\\nto the USVI transaction; that she has satisfied all obligations under\\n\\nthe settlement agreement; and that the probate matter in the South\\n\\nCarolina court has been dismissed with prejudice.\\n\\n                                  8\\n       2. The Parties’ Positions as to the Alleged Rule Violations\\n\\n            a. The State Bar’s Position\\n\\n      The Bar concedes that Brown was not practicing law or\\n\\notherwise acting in her capacity as a lawyer during her service as\\n\\nthe successor trustee to the MBJ Trusts. It nevertheless asserts\\n\\nthat, as a trustee, Brown was acting as a fiduciary and that she is\\n\\ntherefore subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the State Bar for\\n\\nacts undertaken in that capacity—even if she was not engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of law. It thus contends that Brown has violated Rules\\n\\n1.15 (I) (c)4 and 1.15 (II) (b).5\\n\\n\\n      4 Rule 1.15 (I) (c) says: “Upon receiving funds or other property in which\\n\\na client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the\\nclient or third person. Except as stated in this Rule or otherwise permitted by\\nlaw or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the\\nclient or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person\\nis entitled to receive and, upon request by the client or third person, shall\\npromptly render a full accounting regarding such property.”\\n      5 Rule 1.15 (II) (b) says: “No personal funds shall ever be deposited in a\\n\\nlawyer’s trust account, except that unearned lawyer’s fees may be so held until\\nthe same are earned. Sufficient personal funds of the lawyer may be kept in\\nthe trust account to cover maintenance fees such as service charges on the\\naccount. Records on such trust accounts shall be so kept and maintained as to\\nreflect at all times the exact balance held for each client or third person. No\\nfunds shall be withdrawn from such trust accounts for the personal use of the\\nlawyer maintaining the account except earned lawyer’s fees debited against\\nthe account of a specific client and recorded as such.”\\n\\n                                        9\\n       The Bar reasons that, while some of the GRPC expressly\\n\\nregulate a lawyer’s conduct only while the lawyer is practicing law\\n\\nor in connection with a representation, see, e.g., Rule 1.15 (I) (a)6 and\\n\\n(d),7 others, including Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (a)8 and (b),\\n\\napply to a lawyer’s conduct outside of a legal representation of a\\n\\nclient and regardless of whether the lawyer is engaged in the\\n\\npractice of law. Specifically, with respect to Rule 1.15 (I) (c)—which\\n\\n\\n      6 Rule 1.15 (I) (a) says: “A lawyer shall hold funds or other property of\\n\\nclients or third persons that are in a lawyer’s possession in connection with a\\nrepresentation separate from the lawyer’s own funds or other property. Funds\\nshall be kept in one or more separate accounts maintained in an approved\\ninstitution as defined by Rule 1.15 (III) (c) (1). Other property shall be\\nidentified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such\\naccount funds and other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be\\npreserved for a period of six years after termination of the representation.”\\n      7 Rule 1.15 (I) (d) says: “When in the course of representation a lawyer is\\n\\nin possession of funds or other property in which both the lawyer and a client\\nor third person claim interest, the property shall be kept separate by the\\nlawyer until there is an accounting and severance of their interests. If a dispute\\narises concerning their respective interests, the portion in dispute shall be kept\\nseparate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved. The lawyer shall promptly\\ndistribute all portions of the funds or property as to which the interests are not\\nin dispute.”\\n      8 Rule 1.15 (II) (a) says: “Every lawyer who practices law in Georgia,\\n\\nwhether said lawyer practices as a sole practitioner, or as a member of a firm,\\nassociation, or professional corporation, and who receives money or property\\non behalf of a client or in any other fiduciary capacity, shall maintain or have\\navailable one or more trust accounts as required by these Rules. All funds held\\nby a lawyer for a client and all funds held by a lawyer in any other fiduciary\\ncapacity shall be deposited in and administered from a trust account.”\\n\\n                                       10\\n the Bar says applies to lawyers who receive “funds or other property\\n\\nin which a client or third person has an interest,” regardless of\\n\\nwhether the receipt was in connection with a legal representation or\\n\\nin connection with the practice of law—the Bar contends that Rule\\n\\nimposed upon Brown a duty to maintain complete records of the\\n\\nfiduciary funds in her possession and to promptly render an\\n\\naccounting of trust property upon request—neither of which she did,\\n\\ndespite being given multiple extensions by the South Carolina court\\n\\nto do so. The Bar’s view of Rule 1.15 (II) (a) is similarly expansive:\\n\\nit contends that the Rule requires lawyers, like Brown, “who\\n\\nreceive[] money or property on behalf of a client or in any other\\n\\nfiduciary capacity,” to deposit and administer such funds from a\\n\\ntrust account (although not necessarily an IOLTA).9 See Rule 1.15\\n\\n(II) (a) (emphasis supplied). Noting that Brown, in fact, maintained\\n\\nmultiple trust accounts for the purpose of holding the fiduciary\\n\\nfunds she received, the Bar contends that, because the fiduciary\\n\\n\\n      9 Brown is not charged with a Rule 1.15 (II) (a) violation, but the Bar\\n\\npoints to that Rule as context for interpreting Rule 1.15 (II) (b). Bar Supp. Br.\\nat 2, 5 n.5.\\n\\n                                       11\\n funds were held in trust accounts, Brown was required to comply\\n\\nwith the other obligations set out in Rule 1.15 (II) as to those\\n\\naccounts. The Bar then argues that, in this case, Brown violated\\n\\nRule 1.15 (II) (b)—which provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o funds\\n\\nshall be withdrawn from [the] trust accounts [referenced in Rule\\n\\n1.15 (II) (a)] for the personal use of the lawyer maintaining the\\n\\naccount except earned lawyer’s fees debited against the account of a\\n\\nspecific client and recorded as such”—when she made Trust assets\\n\\nin her possession available to a family member by providing a loan\\n\\nto her daughter for the purchase of real property.10 The Bar further\\n\\ncontends that Brown failed to protect the Trusts’ assets by failing to\\n\\nproperly secure the debt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      10  We note that the GRPC do not provide a definition for the term\\n“personal use,” that the Bar offers none, and that no evidence was presented\\non this point because this matter has been presented to this Court by way of\\nvoluntary petition.

In the Matter of Palazzola, 310 Ga. 634, 646-647 (853\\nSE2d 99) (2020) (noting that in construing Rule 8.4 (a) (4), this Court had not\\n“set forth a clear construction of the term ‘professional conduct’ as used in [the\\nRule], in general or in the particular context of law firm management”).\\n\\n                                       12\\n             b. Brown’s Position\\n\\n      Brown admits that she was acting as a fiduciary with regard to\\n\\nthe Trusts, and that, if the Rules allow for disciplining lawyers who\\n\\nare not engaged in the practice of law and if this Court views her\\n\\nconduct as the Bar does, her conduct may amount to a violation of\\n\\nRules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b).11 Brown asserts, however, that\\n\\nthe Bar’s position that her conduct violates the Rules is anchored in\\n\\nRule 1.15 (II) (a)’s language purporting to extend that Rule’s\\n\\napplication to any lawyer who holds funds or other property “in any\\n\\n\\n\\n      11 More specifically, with regard to the alleged violation of Rule 1.15 (I)\\n\\n(c), Brown acknowledges the Bar’s position that her delay in providing an\\naccounting violated the Rule, but contends that, while there was a delay, she\\neventually did provide an accounting in April 2020 and no one has raised any\\nissues as to that accounting. With regard to the alleged violation of Rule 1.15\\n(II) (b), she asserts that no funds from MBJ’s Trusts were ever commingled in\\nher IOLTA/Trust Account because she properly established and maintained\\nseparate trust accounts for each of MBJ’s Trusts at a reputable financial\\ninstitution and held those accounts separate and apart from her own\\nIOLTA/Trust account. Nevertheless, she admits that she used assets of the\\nMBJ Trust to provide a loan to her daughter for the purchase of real property\\n(as was allowed by the Trust documents); that she unintentionally secured the\\nloan with a note that did not sufficiently cover the loan amount; and that she,\\ntherefore, technically failed to protect the Trusts’ assets. Brown asserts that,\\nif the types of trust accounts referenced in Rule 1.15 (II) (b) encompass MBJ’s\\nTrusts (as opposed to only IOLTA trust accounts) and if the loan to her\\ndaughter constitutes “personal use” of Trust funds under the facts of this\\ncase—then she “admits her conduct did not conform with” Rule 1.15 (II) (b).\\n\\n                                       13\\n other fiduciary capacity,” and she notes that there is no authority\\n\\ninterpreting that phrase as used in the Rule.          Among other\\n\\narguments, Brown asserts that the Bar’s expansive interpretation is\\n\\ninconsistent with the plain and ordinary meaning of the text\\n\\ncontained in Rules 1.15 (I) and (II); does not give members of the Bar\\n\\nnotice of such broad implications; and “creates ambiguity when\\n\\nviewed in context of the inherent authority of this Court to govern\\n\\nthe practice of law.”   She contends that the plain and ordinary\\n\\nmeaning of these two Rules, especially when viewed in context,\\n\\nreveals that the more reasonable interpretation is that the Rules are\\n\\nlimited to conduct involving the practice of law and do not reach a\\n\\nlawyer’s private conduct simply because the lawyer is a member of\\n\\nthe State Bar of Georgia.\\n\\n     3. Analysis\\n\\n     In construing the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct, we\\n\\nfirst look to the text of the relevant Rules, which we construe\\n\\n“‘according to the principles that [] ordinarily apply in the\\n\\ninterpretation of legal text.’” In the Matter of Mignott, 317 Ga. 764,\\n\\n                                 14\\n 766 (893 SE2d 891) (2023) (quoting In the Matter of Palazzola, 310\\n\\nGa. at 649-650 (Peterson, J., concurring specially)). “[W]e must\\n\\nafford the statutory text its plain and ordinary meaning, we must\\n\\nview the statutory text in the context in which it appears, and we\\n\\nmust read the statutory text in its most natural and reasonable way,\\n\\nas an ordinary speaker of the English language would.” Deal v.\\n\\nColeman, 294 Ga. 170, 172-173 (751 SE2d 337) (2013) (cleaned up).\\n\\nBut when the language “is not obvious on its face,” we should employ\\n\\nother “tools of construction” to interpret it and resolve its meaning.\\n\\nSee City of Guyton v. Barrow, 305 Ga. 799, 803-805 (828 SE2d 366)\\n\\n(2019) (noting that the principles of interpretation discussed and\\n\\napplied in Deal “apply to all positive legal rules” and applying them\\n\\nto agency regulations).\\n\\n          a. One reading of the text of Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II)\\n             (b) suggests that its scope is so broad that it could apply\\n             to a lawyer acting as a fiduciary outside of a legal\\n             representation of a client or otherwise outside the\\n             practice of law.\\n\\n     With these principles in mind, we begin by observing\\n\\nimportant context about the Rules at issue here: Rules 1.15 (I) – (III)\\n\\n                                  15\\n set out a lawyer’s duties and obligations in maintaining, accounting\\n\\nfor, resolving conflicts as to, and distributing funds and other\\n\\nproperty that come in her possession. Rule 1.15 (I) speaks generally\\n\\nabout a lawyer’s duties and obligations when she comes into\\n\\npossession of funds or other property in which her client or a third\\n\\nperson may have an interest, while Rule 1.15 (II) specifies that a\\n\\nlawyer who receives money or property on behalf of a client or in a\\n\\nfiduciary capacity must maintain a specific type of trust account,\\n\\nhold the funds and other property separate from his own funds, and\\n\\nadminister the funds or property from the trust account. Finally,\\n\\nRule 1.15 (III) sets out more specific rules for a lawyer’s trust\\n\\naccount, including various record-keeping requirements.\\n\\n     With regard to the specific Rules at issue in this case, we turn\\n\\nfirst to the text of Rule 1.15 (I) (c), which provides that:\\n\\n     Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client\\n     or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly\\n     notify the client or third person. Except as stated in this\\n     rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with\\n     the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or\\n     third person any funds or other property that the client or\\n     third person is entitled to receive and, upon request by\\n\\n                                   16\\n       the client or third person, shall promptly render a full\\n      accounting regarding such property.\\n\\n      Viewed in isolation, the text of Rule 1.15 (I) (c)—which seems\\n\\nto apply generally to “lawyers” who have “receiv[ed] funds or other\\n\\nproperty” and contains no express limitation on its application to\\n\\n“lawyers”—does not appear to require that funds be obtained in\\n\\nconnection with a legal representation of a client or in the practice\\n\\nof law for a lawyer’s conduct to be covered by this Rule. That view\\n\\nis supported by the repeated references to a lawyer’s duties in\\n\\nrelation to a “client or third person”; although the first part of that\\n\\nphrase (which references a “client”) suggests that the Rule may\\n\\napply only to lawyers acting within the scope of a legal\\n\\nrepresentation of a client, the second part of that phrase (“or third\\n\\nperson”) arguably expands the scope of the Rule and suggests that\\n\\nit may apply even apart from an attorney-client relationship or other\\n\\nlegal representation of a client.12 Also lending support for such a\\n\\n\\n      12 Moreover, Comment 1 to Rule 1.15 (I), which provides that “[a] lawyer\\n\\nshould hold property of others with the care required of a professional\\nfiduciary,” arguably could be viewed as elevating the role of a lawyer-fiduciary\\nso as to implicate the GRPC, even when a lawyer is not practicing law.\\n\\n                                      17\\n reading is the fact that other subsections of Rule 1.15 (I) include\\n\\nlanguage expressly limiting their application to actions taken in\\n\\nconnection with a representation,13 whereas subsection (c) contains\\n\\nno such limiting language. Applying the canon of statutory\\n\\ninterpretation known as expressio unius est exclusio alterius\\n\\n(the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others), the\\n\\nomission of such limiting language in subsection (c) would support\\n\\nthe view that subsection (c) applies to lawyer conduct even outside\\n\\nthe scope of the attorney-client relationship in a variety of\\n\\ncircumstances—including perhaps to a lawyer’s participation in\\n\\ncommunity activities.14\\n\\n\\n      13 See, e.g., Rule 1.15 (I) (a) (“[a] lawyer shall hold funds or other property\\n\\nof clients or third persons that are in a lawyer’s possession in connection with\\na representation . . .); 1.15 (I) (d) (“When in the course of representation a lawyer\\nis in possession of funds or other property . . .) (emphasis added).\\n      14 Brown contends that the Bar’s expansive interpretation of Rules 1.15\\n\\n(I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) would subject to this Court’s disciplinary authority\\nlawyer-fiduciaries “who have never practiced law but are members of the Bar,\\nand who are employed in some fiduciary capacity, be it with a financial\\ninstitution[]” or “brokerage and investment advisors.” Brown Supp. Br. at 4\\nn.3. But the logical implications of the Bar’s interpretation extend much\\nfurther. For example, it would appear to subject to this Court’s disciplinary\\nauthority the conduct of a parent (who is a lawyer) who serves as the volunteer\\ntreasurer of her child’s sports team (and thus as a fiduciary) and collects funds\\n\\n                                         18\\n       Turning to Rule 1.15 (II) (b), we note the relevant context that\\n\\nRule 1.15 (II) generally provides additional detail on a lawyer’s\\n\\nduties related to safeguarding certain funds or other property that\\n\\ncome into her possession. The Rule mandates establishing a specific\\n\\ntype of trust account from which a lawyer should administer the\\n\\nidentified funds, dictates certain recordkeeping requirements, and\\n\\nsets out rules prohibiting comingling a lawyer’s personal funds with\\n\\nother funds in her possession and prohibiting the lawyer’s\\n\\nwithdrawal of those funds for her own personal use (with some\\n\\nexceptions).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom team members to pay the team’s expenses. For another, consider a grown\\nchild (who is a lawyer) who serves as the trustee of his or her parent’s trust\\n(and thus as a fiduciary). The lawyer’s conduct as trustee would fall within\\nthe Bar’s disciplinary jurisdiction under the Bar’s interpretation of Rules 1.15\\n(I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b), even if he or she were not practicing law and were not\\nengaged in a legal representation of a client. And all manner of a lawyer’s non-\\nlegal financial dealings outside the practice of law could seemingly fall within\\nthe Bar’s purported disciplinary jurisdiction under its interpretation of Rules\\n1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b): a lawyer’s side-hustle flipping houses; her hobby of\\nselling baseball cards on an e-commerce platform; or her community\\ninvolvement on charitable boards. All of a lawyer’s conduct outside the\\npractice of law and outside a legal representation of a client that puts her in a\\nfiduciary position with the money of another could subject her to the Bar’s\\ndisciplinary jurisdiction under its expansive interpretation of Rules 1.15 (I) (c)\\nand 1.15 (II) (b).\\n                                        19\\n      With that overview, we turn to the text of the specific\\n\\nsubsections of Rule 1.15 (II) at issue in this case. Brown is charged\\n\\nwith a violation of Rule 1.15 (II) (b), but because subsection (b) builds\\n\\non subsection (a), we examine the text of both. Rule 1.15 (II) (a)\\n\\nprovides that:\\n\\n     Every lawyer who practices law in Georgia, whether said\\n     lawyer practices as a sole practitioner, or as a member of\\n     a firm, association, or professional corporation, and who\\n     receives money or property on behalf of a client or in any\\n     other fiduciary capacity, shall maintain or have available\\n     one or more trust accounts as required by these rules. All\\n     funds held by a lawyer for a client and all funds held by a\\n     lawyer in any other fiduciary capacity shall be deposited\\n     in and administered from a trust account.\\n\\nAnd Rule 1.15 (II) (b) provides that:\\n\\n     No personal funds shall ever be deposited in a lawyer’s\\n     trust account, except that unearned attorney’s fees may\\n     be so held until the same are earned. Sufficient personal\\n     funds of the lawyer may be kept in the trust account to\\n     cover maintenance fees such as service charges on the\\n     account. Records on such trust accounts shall be so kept\\n     and maintained as to reflect at all times the exact balance\\n     held for each client or third person. No funds shall be\\n     withdrawn from such trust accounts for the personal use\\n     of the lawyer maintaining the account except earned\\n     lawyer’s fees debited against the account of a specific\\n     client and recorded as such.\\n\\n\\n                                   20\\n      By its plain terms, subsection (a) broadly applies to lawyers\\n\\n“who practice law in Georgia,” but it does not make clear by its\\n\\nexpress terms whether it applies only to funds or property obtained\\n\\nby a lawyer in the course of a legal representation of a client. Insofar\\n\\nas the subsection references a lawyer receiving money or property\\n\\nor holding funds “on behalf of a client,” the text suggests that receipt\\n\\nof the money is related to the practice of law. But the subsection\\n\\nalso references lawyers who receive money or property or hold funds\\n\\n“in any other fiduciary capacity,” which—at least on its face—is so\\n\\ncapacious that it could expand the scope of the Rule such that it\\n\\ncovers lawyer conduct outside the practice of law.           Similarly,\\n\\nsubsection (b) speaks broadly and contains no express language\\n\\nspecifying whether its application is limited to trust accounts\\n\\ncontaining funds obtained by a lawyer in the course of a legal\\n\\nrepresentation of a client.\\n\\n     In sum, Rule 1.15 (I) (c) could reasonably be read to apply to\\n\\nany lawyer who receives funds outside the scope of a legal\\n\\nrepresentation of a client or outside the practice of law because Rule\\n\\n                                  21\\n 1.15 (I) (c) seems to apply generally to “lawyers” who have\\n\\n“receiv[ed] funds or other property” and contains no express\\n\\nlimitation on its application to “lawyers.” And Rule 1.15 (II) (b)\\n\\ncould reasonably be read as applying to any lawyer who obtains\\n\\nfunds on behalf of another and acts as a fiduciary for those funds,\\n\\nregardless of whether the lawyer obtained the funds in the course of\\n\\nthe legal representation of a client or as the result of the practice of\\n\\nlaw.\\n\\n            b. Another reading of the text of Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15\\n               (II) (b) is plausible, and that reading would not apply\\n               those Rules to a lawyer acting as a fiduciary outside the\\n               representation of a client or otherwise outside the\\n               practice of law.\\n\\n       But there is a second plausible interpretation of Rules 1.15 (I)\\n\\n(c) and (II) (b): that Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) apply only when\\n\\nthe lawyer conduct at issue involves a legal representation of a client\\n\\nor otherwise involves the practice of law. Turning back to Rule 1.15\\n\\n(I) (c), this alternative interpretation is supported by text that\\n\\nrepeatedly references a “client,” thus suggesting that the Rule’s\\n\\napplication is limited to the context of a lawyer’s legal\\n\\n                                    22\\n representation of a client. And the subsection’s reference to a “third\\n\\nperson” does not defeat that interpretation, because the term “third\\n\\nperson” supports the reasonable inference that the duties and\\n\\nobligations established by the subsection are owed only within the\\n\\ncontext of a legal representation of a client. Using the term “third\\n\\nperson”15—as opposed to, for example, the term “any other person”—\\n\\nnecessarily contemplates the existence of at least two other people\\n\\nas the “principals” in the relationship or transaction—which, in the\\n\\ncontext of Rule 1.15 (I) (c), would be the lawyer and client, such that\\n\\nthe scope of the Rule would be limited to situations where a lawyer\\n\\ncomes into possession of funds or other property as the result of a\\n\\nlegal representation of a client or the practice of law. Comment 3 to\\n\\nRule 1.15 (I) adds additional support to this understanding of the\\n\\nRule’s scope in that it states, in relevant part, that “[t]hird parties,\\n\\nsuch as a client’s creditors, may have just claims against funds or\\n\\nother property in a lawyer’s custody.” (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\n     15 See Third Party, AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH\\n\\nLANGUAGE (4th ed. 2000) (defining “third party” as “[o]ne other than the\\nprincipals involved in a transaction”).\\n\\n                                  23\\n      This narrower reading of subsection (c) is further supported by\\n\\nthe in pari materia canon of statutory interpretation, which provides\\n\\nthat statutes relating to the same subject matter, including\\n\\nsubsections therein, should be construed together and harmonized\\n\\nwhenever possible. See, e.g., In the Interest of T. B., 313 Ga. 846,\\n\\n853 (874 SE2d 101) (2022); Land USA, LLC v. Georgia Power Co.,\\n\\n297 Ga. 237, 241 (773 SE2d 236) (2015). Here, as noted above, Rule\\n\\n1.15 (I) generally establishes a lawyer’s duties and obligations when\\n\\nshe comes into possession of funds and other property of clients and\\n\\nthird persons.    Applying that canon and construing all of the\\n\\nsubsections of Rule 1.15 (I) together in harmony suggests that they\\n\\nestablish a lawyer’s duties and obligations only as to funds or other\\n\\nproperty that come into a lawyer’s possession as the result of the\\n\\npractice of law or in the course of a legal representation of a client.\\n\\nThis is so because subsection (a) specifically limits its scope to funds\\n\\nor other property that are in the lawyer’s possession in connection\\n\\nwith a representation and requires that the funds or other property\\n\\nbe held separate from the lawyer’s own funds or property in a\\n\\n                                  24\\n separate account at an approved institution; that the other property\\n\\nbe appropriately safeguarded; and that proper records be\\n\\nmaintained for six years after termination of the representation. See\\n\\nRule 1.15 (I) (a). And, although subsection (b) does not contain an\\n\\nexplicit limitation to actions undertaken in connection with a\\n\\nrepresentation, the prohibitions set out there build on the duties\\n\\nidentified in subsection (a), and the use of legal terminology and\\n\\nreference to legal judgments and agreements in paragraphs (2) (i) –\\n\\n(iii) of subsection (b)—which preclude a lawyer from disregarding a\\n\\nthird person’s interest in funds or property where that interest is\\n\\nknown to the lawyer and arose as the result of some legal\\n\\nproceeding, judgment, or agreement—seems to suggest that its\\n\\nobligations are limited to actions undertaken in connection with a\\n\\nrepresentation.   See Rule 1.15 (I) (b).   Moreover, subsection (d)\\n\\nexpressly limits its application to funds obtained “in the course of a\\n\\nrepresentation” and further builds on the lawyer’s duties identified\\n\\nin subsection (a), specifying how to resolve disputes regarding the\\n\\ninterests claimed by the client, the attorney, and the third person.\\n\\n                                 25\\n See Rule 1.15 (I) (d). And, the duties set out in subsection (c) could\\n\\nalso be seen as relating back to the funds described in subsection (a)\\n\\nin that subsection (c) builds on the lawyer’s obligations as to such\\n\\nfunds and property, imposing duties to notify, to distribute\\n\\nappropriately, and to provide an accounting upon request. See Rule\\n\\n1.15 (I) (c). In short, when construed together and viewed in context,\\n\\nsubsections (b) through (d) build on a lawyer’s duties and\\n\\nresponsibilities generally described in subsection (a) and could be\\n\\nviewed as constrained by the language of subparagraph (a) that is\\n\\nreasonably read as limiting the Rule to lawyers acting in the course\\n\\nof their legal representation of clients.        This narrower view of the\\n\\nRule is not only reasonable as a matter of textual construction, but\\n\\nalso strikes a balance between protecting the public from\\n\\nunscrupulous individuals engaged in the practice of law16 and not\\n\\nimposing unnecessary burdens on lawyers in other areas of their\\n\\n\\n      16 Because the Bar concedes that Brown was not practicing law when\\n\\nengaged in the conduct at issue, our explanation of this narrower view of Rule\\n1.15 (I) (c) necessarily does not speak to that Rule’s potential application to a\\nlawyer who receives funds of third persons in connection with a representation\\nof a client or in the practice of law.\\n\\n                                       26\\n lives. Cf. In the Matter of Palazzola, 310 Ga. at 646 (emphasizing\\n\\nthat the term “professional conduct” contained in GRPC 8.4 (a) (4)\\n\\n“is not so capacious as to encompass everything a lawyer does in the\\n\\nmanagement of a law office (or for that matter, in life)”).\\n\\n      We observe a similarly reasonable interpretation of Rule 1.15\\n\\n(II) (b).   In particular, as with Rule 1.15 (I) (c), the repeated\\n\\nreferences to “clients” and “third persons” in Rule 1.15 (II) (b)\\n\\n(which, as noted above, presupposes an existing relationship\\n\\nbetween lawyer and client principals), can plausibly be read to limit\\n\\nits application to trust funds involving funds received by a lawyer in\\n\\nconnection with the practice of law.\\n\\n      In addition to the above analysis of the text and context of\\n\\nRules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b), we note that Rules 1.15 (I) through\\n\\n(III) fall under Part One of the GRPC, which is titled “Client-Lawyer\\n\\nRelationship.” The categorization of the Rules at issue here, while\\n\\nnot necessarily dispositive, offers additional context as to the kind\\n\\nof relationship that forms the framework for application of the rules\\n\\nthat follow.   Similarly, Bar Rule 4-102 [13] provides that “[the\\n\\n                                   27\\n GRPC] are rules of reason.               They should be interpreted with\\n\\nreference to the purposes of legal representation and of the law\\n\\nitself.” That Comment’s focus on the dual purposes of “the law” and\\n\\non a lawyer’s representations of clients also suggests that the GRPC\\n\\nare generally meant to regulate a lawyer’s conduct while she is\\n\\nengaged in the representation of a client or otherwise engaged in the\\n\\npractice of law.17      Taking all of these indications together, it is\\n\\nreasonable to read Rule 1.15 (I) (c) and Rule 1.15 (II) (b) as limited\\n\\nto situations in which the money or property at issue has come into\\n\\na lawyer’s possession by virtue of a legal representation of a client,\\n\\nor because the lawyer was engaged in the practice of law, and that\\n\\nthey do not otherwise extend to a lawyer’s conduct outside of a legal\\n\\nrepresentation of a client or the practice of law—including if (for\\n\\nexample) a lawyer is serving as a fiduciary outside the scope of a\\n\\nlegal representation of a client and outside the practice of law.\\n\\n\\n\\n      17 But see, e.g., Rules 8.4 (a) (2) (conviction of a felony is a violation of the\\n\\nGRPC) and 8.4 (a) (3) (misdemeanor conviction is a violation of the GRPC if it\\ninvolves “moral turpitude where the underlying conduct relates to the lawyer’s\\nfitness to practice law”). Those Rules are not at issue in this matter.\\n\\n                                         28\\n            c. The expansive interpretation of Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and\\n              1.15 (II) (a) and (b) the Bar advocates could result in\\n              discipline that exceeds this Court’s inherent authority\\n              to regulate the practice of law.\\n\\n     Faced with two plausible, alternative interpretations of the\\n\\nRules at issue in this matter, we are compelled to point out that the\\n\\nexpansive interpretation of Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) the Bar\\n\\nadvocates implicates real concerns regarding the scope of this\\n\\nCourt’s inherent authority to regulate the practice of law. We have\\n\\nlong held that this Court has the inherent and exclusive authority\\n\\nto regulate the practice of law in Georgia. See Wallace v. Wallace,\\n\\n225 Ga. 102, 110, 111 (166 SE2d 718) (1969) (recognizing that\\n\\n“courts have an inherent power to regulate the conduct of attorneys\\n\\nas officers of the court, and to control and supervise the practice of\\n\\nlaw generally, whether in or out of court” and holding that “[t]his\\n\\ncourt has long recognized the inherent power of the judiciary. . . .\\n\\nThis means, then, when the constitution declares that the\\n\\n[l]egislative, judicial and executive powers shall forever remain\\n\\nseparate and distinct (art. 1, sec. 1, par. 23), it thereby invests those\\n\\n\\n                                   29\\n officials charged with the duty of administering justice according to\\n\\nlaw with all necessary authority to efficiently and completely\\n\\ndischarge those duties the performance of which is by the\\n\\nconstitution committed to the judiciary, and to maintain the dignity\\n\\nand independence of the courts.” (cleaned up)). But our authority to\\n\\nregulate the practice of law is not unbounded, see In the Matter of\\n\\nPalazzola, 310 Ga. at 650 (Peterson, J., specially concurring)\\n\\n(observing that “not every bad thing a lawyer does should jeopardize\\n\\nthe lawyer’s ability to work” and in evaluating Rule 8.4 (a) (4),\\n\\nexpressing skepticism that “the inherent authority to regulate the\\n\\npractice of law that the Georgia Constitution vests in this Court\\n\\nincludes the authority to adopt such a far-reaching rule even if the\\n\\nCourt wanted to”), including because the Due Process clause\\n\\ncontained in the Georgia Constitution guarantees the “‘right to work\\n\\nin one’s chosen profession free from unreasonable government\\n\\ninterference,’” see id. (quoting Jackson v. Raffensperger, 308 Ga.\\n\\n736, 737 (843 SE2d 576) (2020)). See also In the Matter of Fry, 302\\n\\nGa. 370, 371 (806 SE2d 604) (2017) (noting that the “primary\\n\\n                                 30\\n purpose of a disciplinary action is to protect the public from\\n\\nattorneys who are not qualified to practice law due to incompetence\\n\\nor unprofessional conduct” and that “another important purpose . . .\\n\\ninvolves the protection of the public’s confidence in the legal system”\\n\\n(cleaned up)). Although the outer-most bound of this disciplinary\\n\\nauthority is not clear, what is clear is that the farther the effort to\\n\\ndiscipline a lawyer strays from the “‘primary purpose of . . .\\n\\nprotect[ing] the public from attorneys who are not qualified to\\n\\npractice law due to incompetence or unprofessional conduct,’” Fry,\\n\\n302 Ga. at 371 (citation omitted), the greater the risk that such effort\\n\\ncould exceed this Court’s authority to impose lawyer discipline. See\\n\\nIn the Matter of Palazzola, 310 Ga. at 650 (Peterson, J., concurring\\n\\nspecially).\\n\\n     That concern is implicated here, where the Bar concedes that\\n\\nBrown was not engaged in the practice of law and nonetheless seeks\\n\\ndiscipline on the basis of Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b), which\\n\\npurport to apply not only to a lawyer’s handling of funds and other\\n\\nproperty that are in her possession in connection with a legal\\n\\n                                  31\\n representation of a client—but also to a lawyer’s handling of funds\\n\\nand other property that come into her possession wholly unrelated\\n\\nto the practice of law.\\n\\n           d. We apply the canon of constitutional doubt to construe\\n              Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) here.\\n\\n     In this case, however, we need not decide whether applying\\n\\nRules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) to Brown’s conduct could require\\n\\nan exercise of this Court’s authority that would exceed its\\n\\nconstitutional limits, because we can apply the canon of\\n\\nconstitutional doubt to interpret those Rules. “Under the canon of\\n\\nconstitutional doubt, if a statute is susceptible of more than one\\n\\nmeaning, one of which is constitutional and the other not, we\\n\\ninterpret the statute as being consistent with the Constitution.”\\n\\nPremier Health Care Invs., LLC v.

See\\n\\nDomingue v. Ford Motor Co., 314 Ga. 59, 68 n.8 (875 SE2d 720)\\n\\n(2022) (explaining that where there are not “‘competing plausible\\n\\ninterpretations of [the] statutory text,’ the canon of constitutional\\n\\ndoubt does not apply” (citation omitted)); Crowder v.

Because there are two\\n\\ncompeting and plausible interpretations of Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15\\n\\n(II) (b), the canon of constitutional doubt applies, and we conclude\\n\\nthat it weighs against adopting the Bar’s far-reaching view that\\n\\nRules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) apply to Brown’s conduct at issue\\n\\nhere.\\n\\n\\n                                  *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 33\\n      To put a finer point on it: applying the canon of constitutional\\n\\ndoubt to the competing, plausible interpretations of Rules 1.15 (I) (c)\\n\\nand 1.15 (II) (b), we adopt the narrower construction of the Rules (as\\n\\narticulated above) that avoids serious questions about the\\n\\nconstitutionality of those Rules. And that narrower interpretation\\n\\nleads to the conclusion that Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and 1.15 (II) (b) do not\\n\\napply to Brown’s conduct as a fiduciary in this case, even though she\\n\\nis a lawyer licensed in Georgia, because her conduct does not involve\\n\\na legal representation of a client or the practice of law. See Premier\\n\\nHealth Care Invs., LLC, 310 Ga. at 48-49 (applying the canon of\\n\\nconstitutional doubt to avoid an interpretation of a statute that\\n\\n“could raise serious questions about the constitutionality of the\\n\\nGeneral Assembly’s delegation of rulemaking to the Department [of\\n\\nCommunity Health]”). Consequently, we cannot say that Brown’s\\n\\nconduct violated Rules 1.15 (I) (c) and (II) (b) as we have construed\\n\\nthem, and as such, we elect not to exercise our inherent authority to\\n\\nregulate the practice of law by imposing lawyer discipline under\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  34\\n these circumstances.

MAYO v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       COLVIN, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Justin Scott Mayo appeals his convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and other crimes related to the beating death of his\\n\\ngirlfriend, Stephanie Smith. 1 Appellant argues that the trial court\\n\\n\\n       1Smith died on November 4, 2017. On December 19, 2017, a White\\nCounty grand jury indicted Appellant for one count of malice murder (Count\\n1), one count of felony murder (Count 2) predicated on a count of aggravated\\nassault (Count 3), and an additional two counts of felony murder (Counts 4 and\\n6), each of which was predicted on a separate count of aggravated battery\\n(Counts 5 and 7). Appellant was tried by a jury from March 2 to March 6, 2020.\\nFollowing the close of the State’s evidence, the trial court granted Appellant’s\\nmotion for directed verdict as to Counts 4 through 7, thereby acquitting\\nAppellant of two counts of felony murder and the two counts of aggravated\\nbattery on which those felony murder counts were predicated. On March 6,\\n2020, the jury found Appellant guilty of all the remaining counts: malice\\nmurder (Count 1), felony murder (Count 2), and aggravated assault (Count 3).\\nOn March 10, 2020, Appellant was sentenced to life in prison without the\\npossibility of parole for malice murder (Count 1). Though the trial court\\npurported to merge Counts 2 and 3 into Count 1, Count 2 was actually vacated\\nby operation of law. See Williams v. State \\n316 Ga. 147\\n, 153 (3) (\\n886 SE2d 818\\n)\\n(2023).\\n      On April 1, 2020, Appellant filed a timely motion for new trial, which he\\n committed two reversible errors: (1) the trial court presented the\\n\\njury with a “confusing” verdict form that was inconsistent with the\\n\\njury charge; and (2) the trial court received and responded to a note\\n\\nfrom the jury during its deliberations without informing the parties,\\n\\nthereby depriving Appellant of his right to be present throughout\\n\\nthe proceedings against him under Article I, Section I, Paragraph\\n\\nXII of the Georgia Constitution and his right to effective assistance\\n\\nof counsel under the Sixth Amendment of the United States\\n\\nConstitution. 2 For the reasons stated below, Appellant’s claims fail.\\n\\n\\nsubsequently amended through new counsel on August 10, 2020, and again on\\nOctober 25, 2022. Because Appellant’s motion for new trial concerned the trial\\njudge’s ex parte communication with the jury, Appellant filed a motion to\\nrecuse on April 17, 2020, which Appellant supplemented with an additional\\nfiling on the same day. Appellant’s motion to recuse was granted on May 9,\\n2022, and a different judge was appointed to hear Appellant’s motion for new\\ntrial. Following the subsequent judge’s appointment, the trial court held a\\nhearing on Appellant’s motion for new trial on November 22, 2022, and denied\\nit by written order on January 27, 2023. On February 24, 2023, Appellant filed\\na timely notice of appeal directed to this Court. The case was assigned to the\\nterm of this Court beginning in December 2023, and decided on the briefs.\\n       2 Appellant never states expressly whether his claims arise under the\\n\\nUnited States Constitution or the Georgia Constitution. Though he does not\\ncite either constitution, Appellant avers in his brief that he “raised both the\\nstate and federal constitutional violations of Lowery [v. State, \\n282 Ga. 68\\n (\\n646\\nSE2d 67\\n) (2007)] and the failure to follow this Court’s Lowery procedures”\\nduring the hearing on his motion for new trial. Lowery concerned a defendant’s\\nright to be present at trial under the Georgia Constitution and his right to\\n\\n                                       2\\n       1. At approximately 2:00 p.m. on November 4, 2017, Appellant\\n\\nentered the White County Sheriff’s Office and told the detention\\n\\nofficer at the front desk that he thought his girlfriend, Smith, was\\n\\ndead. Law enforcement officers were dispatched to Appellant and\\n\\nSmith’s shared residence, where they found a trail of bloodstains\\n\\nfrom Smith’s car in the driveway, along the front porch, to the door,\\n\\nwhich had been kicked in. Inside, Smith was found deceased, lying\\n\\nnude in her bed, covered by a blanket and a small red towel or\\n\\nwashcloth over her eyes. Her body exhibited numerous and\\n\\nextensive injuries, and the bedroom itself was littered with broken\\n\\nand overturned objects. There appeared to be bloodstains on the\\n\\n\\n\\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See\\nLowery, \\n282 Ga. at 73\\n (4) (b). Appellant also cites Carter v. State, \\n273 Ga. 428\\n\\n(\\n541 SE2d 366\\n) (2001) and Hanifa v. State, \\n269 Ga. 797\\n (\\n505 SE2d 731\\n) (1998),\\neach of which concerns a defendant’s right to be present at trial under Article I,\\nSection I, Paragraph XII of the Georgia Constitution. See Carter, \\n273 Ga. at\\n429-430\\n (3); Hanifa, \\n269 Ga. at 807\\n (6). We therefore conclude that Appellant’s\\nchallenge to the trial court’s alleged infringement of his right to be present\\nconcerns Appellant’s right under the Georgia Constitution and that his claim\\nregarding effective assistance of counsel is raised under the United States\\nConstitution. We remind counsel to cite those portions of the constitutions on\\nwhich they rely. See Supreme Court Rule 19 (1) (g) (requiring the appellant’s\\nbrief to contain an argument section which “cite[s] the authorities relied on”);\\nSupreme Court Rule 22 (2) (“[B]riefs must contain full and complete citations\\nof authority.”).\\n                                        3\\n floor, and there were large amounts of dried blood in the nearby\\n\\nbathroom.\\n\\n     While law enforcement officers were searching Appellant’s\\n\\nhome, Appellant remained at the White County Sheriff’s Office.\\n\\nThere, he gave one written statement and two oral statements to\\n\\nlaw enforcement officers. Appellant’s second oral statement was\\n\\nvideo-recorded, admitted into evidence at trial, and played for the\\n\\njury. In Appellant’s second oral statement, which was consistent\\n\\nwith his first, Appellant explained that he and Smith had gone out\\n\\nthe prior evening with Smith’s friends to two bars in Helen, Georgia.\\n\\nAppellant stated that he “black[ed] out” from alcohol, but that he\\n\\npartially remembered getting into a verbal fight with Smith in\\n\\nHelen because she had been flirting with and “touching” another\\n\\nman at one of the bars. Appellant further stated that he did not\\n\\nremember whether he or Smith drove them home, but that he had\\n\\nsome memory of getting into a physical fight with Smith during the\\n\\ndrive, kicking in the front door, and continuing the altercation before\\n\\nand after Smith took a bath. Though Appellant’s reported memory\\n\\n                                  4\\n of the events was incomplete, he admitted that he was the sole\\n\\nperson responsible for Smith’s death.\\n\\n     A subsequent autopsy revealed the extent of Smith’s injuries.\\n\\nAccording to the testimony of Dr. John Wassum, an assistant\\n\\nmedical examiner for the GBI, Smith had dozens of contusions\\n\\nacross the front and sides of her body consistent with blunt-force\\n\\ntrauma. There were at least ten contusions on her face, covering\\n\\nboth cheeks and both eyes, her forehead, chin, jaw line, and ear lobe.\\n\\nFurther injuries consistent with blunt-force trauma were found on\\n\\nher abdomen, chest, arms, and hands, as well as on her knees, shins,\\n\\nand both ankles. An internal examination revealed that Smith had\\n\\ntwo broken ribs and a “large[,] ragged laceration” on her liver, which\\n\\ncaused large amounts of internal bleeding. Smith also had a\\n\\nhematoma that was “diffuse across the entire scalp,” as well as\\n\\nsubdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages in her brain. The fifth\\n\\ncervical vertebra in her neck was broken, which, in Dr. Wassum’s\\n\\nopinion, was likely caused by the blunt-force trauma to her chin. Dr.\\n\\nWassum determined that Smith’s cause of death was blunt-force\\n\\n                                  5\\n trauma to her head, neck, and torso.\\n\\n     At trial, Appellant conceded through counsel that he had killed\\n\\nSmith but argued that the jury should find him guilty only of\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter, rather than of murder.\\n\\n     2. On appeal, Appellant argues that the sequencing of the\\n\\nverdict form — which listed pre-printed options for malice murder,\\n\\nfelony murder, voluntary manslaughter, and aggravated assault, in\\n\\nthat order — was “confusing” because it was inconsistent with the\\n\\njury instructions in two related, but distinct ways. First, Appellant\\n\\nclaims that, though the trial court correctly instructed the jury that\\n\\nit could return a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter for\\n\\neither Count 1 (malice murder) or Count 2 (felony murder), the\\n\\nverdict form listed voluntary manslaughter only after Count 2. In\\n\\nAppellant’s view, the form therefore “implied that voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter was not a valid alternative for malice murder in\\n\\nCount 1.” Second, Appellant argues that the verdict form incorrectly\\n\\nimplied that the jury was required to determine whether Appellant\\n\\nwas guilty of malice murder and felony murder before considering\\n\\n                                  6\\n voluntary manslaughter, contrary to the court’s jury charge, which\\n\\ncorrectly provided that the jury must determine if there were\\n\\nmitigating circumstances that would reduce either Count 1 or\\n\\nCount 2 to voluntary manslaughter before it was authorized to\\n\\nreturn a verdict on either count. While both issues arise from the\\n\\ntrial court’s choice to list options for malice murder, felony murder,\\n\\nand voluntary manslaughter in that order, they present distinct\\n\\nchallenges to the verdict form, and, as explained below, only the first\\n\\nof these claims was preserved for ordinary appellate review. We\\n\\naccordingly treat them separately, and, after review, conclude that\\n\\nboth fail.\\n\\n     (a) During its charge to the jury, the trial court instructed the\\n\\njury on Appellant’s presumption of innocence, the State’s burden of\\n\\nproof, and reasonable doubt. The court also instructed the jury on\\n\\nmalice murder, felony murder, and voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n     In defining malice murder, the court explained that “[a] person\\n\\ncommits murder when that person unlawfully and with malice\\n\\naforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another\\n\\n                                  7\\n human being.” The court further instructed the jury that “[l]egal\\n\\nmalice is not necessarily ill will or hatred, but it is an unlawful\\n\\nintention to kill without justification, excuse, or mitigation.”\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) When defining felony murder, the court stated\\n\\nthat “[a] person also commits the crime of murder when, in the\\n\\ncommission of a felony, that person causes the death of another\\n\\nhuman being with or without malice.” Following the court’s\\n\\ninstructions regarding malice murder and felony murder, it stated:\\n\\n     After consideration of all the evidence, before you would\\n     be authorized to return a verdict of guilty of malice\\n     murder or felony murder, you must first determine\\n     whether mitigating circumstances, if any, would cause\\n     the offenses to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.)\\n\\n     The court then defined voluntary manslaughter as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\n     A person commits voluntary manslaughter when that\\n     person causes the death of another human being under\\n     circumstances that would otherwise be murder if that\\n     person acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and\\n     irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation\\n     sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person.\\n\\n\\n                                 8\\n After explaining voluntary manslaughter, the trial court\\n\\nstated:\\n\\n     The burden of proof is upon the State to prove beyond a\\n     reasonable doubt that the offense is not so mitigating. If\\n     you do not believe beyond a reasonable doubt the\\n     defendant is guilty of murder in Count l or felony murder\\n     in Count 2, but do believe beyond a reasonable doubt that\\n     the defendant is guilty of voluntary manslaughter, then\\n     you would be authorized to find the defendant guilty of\\n     voluntary manslaughter as to that respective count and\\n     the form of your verdict in that event would be: [“]We, the\\n     jury, find the defendant guilty of voluntary\\n     manslaughter[”] as to that count.\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied.) The court did not instruct the jury on any other\\n\\ncircumstances in which it was authorized to return a guilty verdict\\n\\nfor voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n     The trial court prepared a verdict form but did not discuss it\\n\\nwith the parties during the charge conference. The form began with\\n\\nCount 1 (malice murder) and provided pre-printed options for the\\n\\njury to mark whether it found Appellant “guilty” or “not guilty.” The\\n\\nform then listed the same options for Count 2 (felony murder).\\n\\nFollowing Count 2, the form stated:\\n\\n     After considering the evidence in this case:\\n\\n                                 9\\n      ( ) We, the jury, finds [sic] the evidence DOES show\\n     sufficient mitigation and that [Appellant] [is] guilty of\\n     the offense of VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.\\n\\n     ( ) We, the Jury, finds [sic] the evidence DOES NOT show\\n     sufficient mitigation and that [Appellant] [is] not guilty\\n     of the offense of VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.\\n\\n(Emphasis in the original.) The form concluded by listing the options\\n\\nof guilty and not guilty for Count 3, aggravated assault.\\n\\n     Immediately following the jury charge, Appellant objected to\\n\\nthe verdict form on the ground that it was inconsistent with the jury\\n\\ninstructions. Appellant argued then, as he does now, that the verdict\\n\\nform should begin with voluntary manslaughter, rather than\\n\\nmurder, so as to make it consistent with the jury charge. The trial\\n\\ncourt overruled Appellant’s objection.\\n\\n     During the jury’s deliberations, the jury wrote a note to the\\n\\ntrial court asking, “On Count 2, if we find the defendant guilty of\\n\\nfelony murder[,] do we mark anything on the second section\\n\\nindicating guilty or not guilty of voluntary manslaughter?” This note\\n\\nwas delivered by the bailiff to the trial judge in chambers. Neither\\n\\n\\n                                 10\\n party was alerted at that time to the jury’s note nor consulted about\\n\\nthe trial court’s response. The trial judge wrote on the note, “No, you\\n\\nwill leave that portion blank,” and the note was returned to the jury.\\n\\n     When the jury finished deliberating, it was asked to read its\\n\\nverdict, and the jury foreperson pronounced the defendant guilty of\\n\\nCounts 1 and 2. After the foreperson read Count 2, the trial judge\\n\\ninterrupted and asked, “And before we go any further, . . . did the\\n\\njury consider . . . whether there were any mitigating circumstances\\n\\nthat would justify voluntary manslaughter?” The foreperson\\n\\nresponded, “Yes.” The court then asked the foreperson to continue,\\n\\nand the foreperson announced that the jury had found Appellant\\n\\nguilty of Count 3, aggravated assault. Consistent with the trial\\n\\ncourt’s response to the note, the jury left blank the portion of the\\n\\nverdict form regarding voluntary manslaughter. The jury was\\n\\npolled, and each member confirmed the verdict.\\n\\n     (b) A verdict form in a criminal case is erroneous when “the\\n\\nform would mislead jurors of reasonable understanding, or the trial\\n\\ncourt erroneously instructed the jury on . . . the possible verdicts\\n\\n                                  11\\n that could be returned, or how the verdict should be entered on the\\n\\nprinted form.” Ruff v. State, \\n314 Ga. 386\\n, 388 (2) (\\n877 SE2d 239\\n)\\n\\n(2022) (citation and punctuation omitted). When determining\\n\\nwhether there is error regarding a preprinted verdict form, the “form\\n\\nis treated as part of the jury instructions which are read and\\n\\nconsidered as a whole.” Atkins v. State, \\n310 Ga. 246\\n, 252 (3) (\\n850\\n\\nSE2d 103\\n) (2020). See also Rowland v. State, \\n306 Ga. 59\\n, 67-68 (6),\\n\\n(\\n829 SE2d 81\\n) (2019) (“In deciding whether a verdict form accurately\\n\\npresented the law and properly guided the jury, we review the form’s\\n\\nlanguage in conjunction with the rest of the trial court’s jury\\n\\ninstructions.”).\\n\\n     (i) As an initial matter, the State argues that Appellant failed\\n\\nto preserve for ordinary appellate review his argument that\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter should have also been included on the\\n\\nverdict form immediately after Count 1, as it had been after Count\\n\\n2, because Appellant failed to object on that specific ground at trial.\\n\\nSee OCGA § 17-8-58 (providing that a party who objects to any\\n\\nportion of the jury charge must “inform the court of the specific\\n\\n                                  12\\n objection and the grounds for such objection before the jury retires\\n\\nto deliberate,” and that a failure to make such an objection “shall\\n\\npreclude appellate review of such portion of the jury charge, unless\\n\\nsuch portion of the jury charge constitutes plain error which affects\\n\\nsubstantial rights of the parties.”). We agree, and therefore review\\n\\nfor plain error Appellant’s claim that the trial court should have\\n\\nlisted voluntary manslaughter after Count 1, in addition to Count 2.\\n\\nSee Jones v.

To show plain error:\\n\\n     the appellant must demonstrate that the instructional\\n     error was not affirmatively waived, was obvious beyond\\n     reasonable dispute, likely affected the outcome of the\\n     proceedings, and seriously affected the fairness, integrity,\\n     or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Satisfying all\\n     four prongs of this standard is difficult, as it should be.\\n\\n\\n                                 13\\n State v. Owens, \\n312 Ga. 212\\n, 219 (3) (\\n862 SE2d 125\\n) (2021). The\\n\\nfailure to meet a single element of this test “dooms a plain error\\n\\nclaim.” Rogers v. State, \\n311 Ga. 634\\n, 638 (3) (\\n859 SE2d 92\\n) (2021).\\n\\n     Here, Appellant has failed to show that the trial court’s\\n\\ndecision to include an option on the verdict form for voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter only after Count 2 instead of after both murder counts\\n\\nlikely affected the outcome of the proceedings. Though there may\\n\\nhave been better ways to formulate or sequence the verdict form, see\\n\\nChapman v. State, \\n258 Ga. 214\\n, 216 (4) (\\n367 SE2d 541\\n) (1988) (“We\\n\\nreiterate here our opinion . . . that it would be safer to omit\\n\\npreprinted terms of ‘guilty’ and ‘not guilty’ from any verdict form\\n\\nsubmitted to the jury and to require the verdict be completed by the\\n\\nhand of the jury.” (citation and punctuation omitted)), the trial court\\n\\ncorrectly instructed the jury that voluntary manslaughter was an\\n\\noption for both murder counts. Specifically, as recounted above, the\\n\\ntrial court instructed the jury that it was required to determine\\n\\n“whether mitigating circumstances . . . would cause the offenses” of\\n\\nmalice murder or felony murder “to be reduced to voluntary\\n\\n                                  14\\n manslaughter.” The court further instructed the jury that if it did\\n\\nnot believe Appellant was guilty of malice murder or felony murder\\n\\nbut did believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was guilty\\n\\nof voluntary manslaughter, then it “would be authorized to find the\\n\\ndefendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter as to that respective\\n\\ncount.” (Emphasis supplied.) In light of these instructions, the\\n\\ncorrectness of which Appellant concedes, and which we are required\\n\\nto view together with the verdict form, it is likely that the jury\\n\\nunderstood the verdict form’s preprinted options for voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter were meant to apply to both counts of murder, rather\\n\\nthan only to Count 2 (felony murder), and it is unlikely that the\\n\\nstructure of the verdict form affected the outcome of the proceedings\\n\\nwith respect to Count 1, as Appellant contends. We therefore\\n\\nconclude that the trial court did not plainly err by listing voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter only after Count 2. See Leeks v. State, \\n296 Ga. 515\\n,\\n\\n522 (6) (\\n769 SE2d 296\\n) (2015) (holding that it was not error for the\\n\\ntrial court to refuse, over objection, to use a special verdict form\\n\\nlisting voluntary manslaughter after each count of murder, and to\\n\\n                                 15\\n instead use a general verdict form with pre-printed options of\\n\\n“guilty” and “not guilty” where the court instructed the jury on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter and where there was “sufficient space\\n\\nunderneath each count for the jury to write in a lesser included\\n\\noffense or another offense.”).\\n\\n     Appellant appears to argue that the jury note implied the\\n\\njurors were “confused” and they did not understand that voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter was a possible alternative to malice murder. As\\n\\nstated above, the jury asked, “On Count 2, if we find the defendant\\n\\nguilty of felony murder[,] do we mark anything on the second section\\n\\nindicating guilty or not guilty of voluntary manslaughter?”\\n\\nAppellant appears to suggest that the framing of the jury’s question,\\n\\nwhich concerns only Count 2, shows that the jury did not have\\n\\nsimilar questions with respect to Count 1. This further implies that\\n\\nthe jury did not have such questions because they did not\\n\\nunderstand that they could convict Appellant of voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter for Count 1.\\n\\n     To the extent any such implication arises, however, it is\\n\\n                                 16\\n insufficient to rebut “the presumption that qualified jurors, in the\\n\\nabsence of clear evidence to the contrary, followed the instructions\\n\\nof the trial court” to consider voluntary manslaughter with respect\\n\\nto each of Appellant’s murder charges. Herring v. State, \\n277 Ga. 317\\n,\\n\\n320 (6) (c) (\\n588 SE2d 711\\n) (2003) (emphasis supplied). The fact that\\n\\nthe jury failed to ask a similar question with respect to Count 1 is\\n\\nnot clear evidence that the jurors ignored the court’s instructions or\\n\\nthat they were confused: it could be that the jury asked this question\\n\\nafter considering any mitigating evidence and determining that\\n\\nAppellant was guilty of felony murder, but before reaching a\\n\\nconsensus on malice murder, and that the Court’s response to its\\n\\nquestion forestalled further similar questions. Other explanations\\n\\nare possible. As such, the jury note falls short of the clear evidence\\n\\nneeded to rebut the presumption of jurors’ adherence to the court’s\\n\\ninstructions. See Herring, \\n277 Ga. at 320\\n (6) (c).\\n\\n     (ii) In Appellant’s second claim regarding the verdict form, he\\n\\nargues that the form improperly listed malice murder and felony\\n\\nmurder before voluntary manslaughter, thereby implying that the\\n\\n                                  17\\n jury should determine its verdicts on those charges prior to\\n\\nconsidering whether there was mitigating evidence that would\\n\\nreduce these charges. Though Appellant preserved this claim for\\n\\nordinary appellate review by objecting at trial, his claim fails.\\n\\n     In Van v. State, \\n294 Ga. 464\\n (\\n754 SE2d 355\\n) (2014), this Court\\n\\nconsidered an almost identical argument regarding the use of a\\n\\nverdict form that listed malice murder, felony murder, and\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter in the same order as the form used here.\\n\\nSee Van, \\n294 Ga. at 467\\n (4). There, we held that “[m]erely listing the\\n\\noffenses on the verdict form in order of malice murder, felony\\n\\nmurder, and voluntary manslaughter did not constitute reversible\\n\\nerror” where the trial court had otherwise properly instructed the\\n\\njurors on the presumption of innocence, the State’s burden of proof,\\n\\nthe possible verdicts that could be returned, and how to enter the\\n\\nverdict on the printed form. \\nId.\\n\\n\\n     Appellant concedes that the trial court’s formal charge to the\\n\\njury — which covered Appellant’s presumption of innocence, the\\n\\nState’s burden of proof, the possible verdicts for each charge and how\\n\\n                                   18\\n to enter such verdicts on the printed form — was correct, but he\\n\\ncontends that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury\\n\\nregarding the verdict form when responding to its note. We therefore\\n\\nconsider whether the court erred in this regard.\\n\\n     As recounted above, during the jury’s deliberations, it sent a\\n\\nnote to the court asking, “On Count 2, if we find the defendant guilty\\n\\nof felony murder[,] do we mark anything on the second section\\n\\nindicating guilty or not guilty of voluntary manslaughter?” and the\\n\\ncourt responded, “No, you will leave that portion blank.” Appellant\\n\\nargues that this response was erroneous: in Appellant’s view, the\\n\\ncourt’s response was akin to “telling the jury it should not even make\\n\\na decision on voluntary manslaughter if it voted to convict on felony\\n\\nmurder.”\\n\\n     Appellant has raised two issues with the court’s response,\\n\\narguing that, consistent with this instruction, (1) the jury could\\n\\ndetermine Appellant was guilty of felony murder without\\n\\nconsidering whether there were mitigating circumstances that\\n\\nwould reduce that offense to voluntary manslaughter or (2) the jury\\n\\n                                 19\\n could determine that Appellant was guilty of both felony murder and\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter (but leave the portion of the verdict\\n\\ncorresponding to voluntary manslaughter blank, in accordance with\\n\\nthe court’s instruction).3\\n\\n      We do not construe the court’s response to the note in a\\n\\nvacuum, however; it was but one instruction that must be considered\\n\\ntogether with the court’s other instructions as a whole. Appellant\\n\\nargues that the court’s response permitted the jury to find the\\n\\ndefendant guilty of felony murder without considering evidence in\\n\\nmitigation. But, as we have already noted, the court previously\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 These options would be problematic because, as we explained in Edge\\n\\nv. State, \\n261 Ga. 865\\n (\\n414 SE2d 463\\n) (1992), a defendant cannot be convicted\\nof both felony murder and voluntary manslaughter for the same underlying\\nassault, and because, where there is at least slight evidence of voluntary\\nmanslaughter, “a sequential charge requiring the jury to consider voluntary\\nmanslaughter only if they have considered and found the defendant not guilty\\nof malice murder and felony murder is not appropriate.” See Edge, \\n261 Ga. at\\n865-867\\n (2). We have held, however, that where, as here, the court instructs\\nthe jury it must first determine whether “mitigating evidence, if any, would\\ncause the offense to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter,” before the jury is\\n“authorized to return a verdict of guilty of malice murder or felony murder,”\\nthe jury charge is not improperly sequential in violation of Edge. See Elvie v.\\nState, \\n289 Ga. 779\\n, 780 (2) (\\n716 SE2d 170\\n) (2011) (explaining that the pattern\\ncharge referenced above “has frequently been relied upon in determining that\\nthe jury was not given improper sequential instructions in violation of Edge”).\\n                                      20\\n instructed the jury that it “must first determine” whether there were\\n\\nmitigating circumstances that would reduce felony murder to\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter “before” the jury “would be authorized to\\n\\nreturn a verdict of guilty” on the felony murder count. When the\\n\\ncourt’s response to the jury note is considered together with this\\n\\ninstruction, Appellant’s first argument fails. It makes no difference\\n\\nthat the court did not recharge the jury that it must first determine\\n\\nwhether there were mitigating circumstances before it was\\n\\nauthorized to find the defendant guilty of felony murder: because the\\n\\njury did not request a recharge on this instruction, the court was\\n\\nwithin its sound discretion not to give it. See Barnes v. State, \\n305\\n\\nGa. 18\\n, 23 (3) (\\n823 SE2d 302\\n) (2019) (“A trial court has a duty to\\n\\nrecharge the jury on issues for which the jury requests a recharge.\\n\\nAs a general matter, however, where no such request has been made\\n\\n[by the jury], the need, breadth, and formation of additional jury\\n\\ninstructions are left to the sound discretion of the trial court.”).\\n\\n     Appellant’s second argument also fails. Appellant claimed at\\n\\ntrial that if the jury followed the trial court’s direction to leave a\\n\\n                                   21\\n portion of the verdict form blank, we would not know if the jury\\n\\nfound Appellant guilty of both felony murder and voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. But the only circumstance under which the court\\n\\nauthorized the jury to return a verdict of guilty of voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter for Count 2 was if, after considering evidence in\\n\\nmitigation, the jury did “not believe beyond a reasonable doubt the\\n\\ndefendant is guilty of . . . felony murder.” Specifically, the court\\n\\ninstructed the jury that a guilty verdict of voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nfor Count 2 required the following: (1) proof by the State of “every\\n\\nessential element” of felony murder “beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2)\\n\\nthe State’s failure “to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\\n\\noffense [was] not . . . mitigat[ed]; and (3) proof beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt that Appellant “cause[d] the death of another human being\\n\\nunder circumstances that would otherwise be murder” (emphasis\\n\\nsupplied); but for (4) the jury’s determination beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt that Appellant acted “solely as a result of a sudden, violent,\\n\\nand irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient\\n\\nto excite such passion in a reasonable person.” Further, as\\n\\n                                 22\\n previously explained, the court instructed the jury that it must\\n\\nconsider evidence in mitigation before returning a verdict of guilty\\n\\nfor felony murder. Considering the court’s response to the note\\n\\ntogether with its previous instructions, as we must, the trial court’s\\n\\ninstructions did not permit the jury to find the defendant guilty of\\n\\nboth felony murder and voluntary manslaughter at the same time\\n\\nwhile leaving the voluntary manslaughter portion of the verdict\\n\\nform blank. Thus, in the context of the court’s other instructions, the\\n\\ncourt’s response was within its discretion and not incorrect. See\\n\\nWhite v. State, \\n291 Ga. 7\\n, 9 (3) (\\n727 SE2d 109\\n) (2012) (no error where\\n\\nthe trial court accepted a verdict that found the defendant guilty of\\n\\nfelony murder but left the portion of the verdict form corresponding\\n\\nto voluntary manslaughter blank); Barnes, \\n305 Ga. at 23\\n (3).\\n\\n     Appellant nonetheless argues that the jury’s note shows it had\\n\\nalready determined Appellant was guilty of felony murder without\\n\\nconsidering voluntary manslaughter, in violation of the jury charge.\\n\\nWe disagree. Because the jury note asked how to complete the\\n\\nverdict form “if” the jury found the defendant guilty of murder, we\\n\\n                                  23\\n cannot conclude from it that the jury had already made such a\\n\\ndetermination or that it made such a determination without first\\n\\nconsidering evidence in mitigation. This is especially true where the\\n\\njury foreperson later confirmed during his recitation of the verdict\\n\\nthat the jury had considered evidence in mitigation as instructed.\\n\\nSee Herring, \\n277 Ga. at 320\\n (6) (c) (“While a verdict form that\\n\\ndemonstrates    the   jury   considered   and   rejected   voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter is helpful, its absence does not overcome the\\n\\npresumption that qualified jurors, in the absence of clear evidence\\n\\nto the contrary, followed the instructions of the trial court to\\n\\nconsider voluntary manslaughter before considering the felony\\n\\nmurder charge.” (citations and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     Because the trial court’s response to the note was not incorrect\\n\\nand because the foreperson confirmed, during the return of the\\n\\nverdict and in response to the judge’s question, that the jury did in\\n\\nfact follow the court’s instructions, Van controls Appellant’s claim\\n\\nregarding the allegedly erroneous ordering of the charges on the\\n\\nverdict form. Appellant’s claim therefore fails. See Van, \\n294 Ga. at\\n\\n24\\n 467 (4) (holding that where the jury was properly instructed on the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, the State’s burden of proof, and the\\n\\npossible verdicts that could be returned, “[m]erely listing the\\n\\noffenses on the verdict form in order of malice murder, felony\\n\\nmurder, and voluntary manslaughter did not constitute reversible\\n\\nerror”).\\n\\n     3. In his final enumeration of error, Appellant argues that the\\n\\ntrial court violated both his right under Article I, Section I,\\n\\nParagraph XII of the Georgia Constitution to be present during the\\n\\ncriminal proceedings against him and his right under the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment of the United States Constitution to the effective\\n\\nassistance of counsel by receiving and responding to the jury note\\n\\noutside the presence of the parties and without consulting counsel\\n\\nregarding the court’s response. Because we agree that the trial court\\n\\nmishandled its response to the jury note, we assume without\\n\\ndeciding that the trial court violated Appellant’s right to counsel\\n\\nunder the United States Constitution and his right to be present\\n\\nunder the Georgia Constitution. We nevertheless conclude, however,\\n\\n                                 25\\n that the court’s assumed violation of Appellant’s right to counsel was\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt and that the rebuttable\\n\\npresumption of harm arising from the court’s assumed violation of\\n\\nAppellant’s right to be present was overcome by the evidence, as\\n\\nexplained further below.\\n\\n     (a) The parties did not become aware of the note described\\n\\nabove until after the trial court dismissed the jury. After the jury\\n\\ndeparted, the trial court informed counsel for both parties that it\\n\\nhad received the note described above, explained its response, and\\n\\ngave the parties a chance to inspect the note, which was marked as\\n\\nCourt’s Exhibit 1 and entered into the record.\\n\\n     Appellant objected to the trial court’s communication with the\\n\\njury outside of the presence of the parties. Appellant also objected to\\n\\nthe trial court’s procedure insofar as it failed to notify the parties of\\n\\nthe note until after the jury was dismissed, thereby depriving\\n\\nAppellant of the chance to move timely for mistrial. Appellant\\n\\nnevertheless attempted to move for mistrial, which the trial court\\n\\ndenied before Appellant could state the grounds for his motion. The\\n\\n                                   26\\n trial judge then adjourned the trial and instructed the court reporter\\n\\nto stop transcribing the proceedings, even though Appellant’s\\n\\ncounsel was still attempting to articulate the grounds for his\\n\\nmotion. 4\\n\\n     (b) In Lowery v. State, \\n282 Ga. 68\\n (\\n646 SE2d 67\\n) (2007), we\\n\\nexercised our “inherent power” to announce a set of rules governing\\n\\njurors’ communications with the trial court (the “Lowery Rules”).\\n\\nLowery, \\n282 Ga. at 76\\n (4) (b) (ii). Under the Lowery Rules, trial\\n\\ncourts are required:\\n\\n        to have jurors’ communications submitted to the court\\n        in writing; to mark the written communication as a\\n        court exhibit in the presence of counsel; to afford\\n        counsel a full opportunity to suggest an appropriate\\n        response; and to make counsel aware of the substance\\n        of the trial court’s intended response in order that\\n        counsel may seek whatever modifications counsel\\n        deems appropriate before the jury is exposed to the\\n        instruction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 We do not condone the conduct of the trial court. The trial court violated\\n\\nthe procedures set forth in Lowery v. State, \\n282 Ga. 68\\n (\\n646 SE2d 67\\n) (2007),\\nand the court’s attempt to end the proceedings and close the record while\\ncounsel was still attempting to articulate the grounds for his motion for\\nmistrial was inappropriate.\\n                                      27\\n Id.\\n 5 The State does not dispute that the trial court failed to follow\\n\\nthese procedures.\\n\\n     Though we have applied harmless error analysis to claims\\n\\narising from a trial court’s failure to follow the Lowery Rules, see\\n\\ne.g., Styles v. State, \\n309 Ga. 463\\n, 469 (3) (\\n847 SE2d 325\\n) (2020);\\n\\nGrant v. State, \\n295 Ga. 126\\n, 129 (4) (\\n757 SE2d 831\\n) (2014), we have\\n\\napplied heightened standards of review where an appellant asserts\\n\\nthat the trial court violated a constitutional right in the course of a\\n\\nLowery violation. Where, as here, an appellant argues that a trial\\n\\ncourt violated his right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment by failing to follow the Lowery Rules, we have applied\\n\\nfederal precedent requiring the State to show that any such error is\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Lowery, \\n282 Ga. at 75-76\\n\\n\\n(4) (b) (ii) (citing Chapman v. California, \\n386 U.S. 18\\n, 24 (III) (87\\n\\nSCt 824, 17 LE2d 705) (1967)). See also Muse v. State, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n,\\n\\n\\n     5 As we noted in Styles v. State, \\n309 Ga. 463\\n (\\n847 SE2d 325\\n) (2020),\\n\\n“[s]ome of us have questions as to the propriety of our unilateral\\npronouncement of a new rule of procedure in Lowery, rather than through the\\nrule-making process established by the Georgia Constitution.” Styles, 309 Ga.\\nat 469 (3) n.6.\\n                                     28\\n 657-658 (5) (c) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023) (citing Lowery and applying a\\n\\nconstitutional harm standard).\\n\\n     Where, however, an appellant raises a right-to-be-present\\n\\nclaim under the Georgia Constitution regarding substantive\\n\\ncommunications between the court and the jury during its\\n\\ndeliberations outside the parties’ presence, we have instead applied\\n\\na rebuttable-presumption-of-harm standard. See Hanifa v. State,\\n\\n269 Ga. 797\\n, 807 (6) (\\n505 SE2d 731\\n) (1998) (stating that “unless the\\n\\ncharacter of the communication” between the court and the jury\\n\\n“clearly shows that it could not have been prejudicial to the accused,\\n\\nthe presumption of law would be that it was prejudicial” (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted)), disapproved of on other grounds by Clark\\n\\nv. State, \\n315 Ga. 423\\n (\\n883 SE2d 317\\n) (2023). See also Fuller v. State,\\n\\n277 Ga. 505\\n, 506 (2) (\\n591 SE2d 782\\n) (2004) (quoting Hanifa, \\n269 Ga.\\n\\nat 807\\n (6)); Waldrip v. State, \\n266 Ga. 874\\n, 878-879 (2) (\\n471 SE2d 857\\n)\\n\\n(1996) (holding that the presumption of error that arose from the\\n\\ntrial judge eating lunch with the sequestered jury was overcome and\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 29\\n that the error was harmless).6\\n\\n      (c) It is undisputed that the trial court failed to follow the\\n\\nLowery Rules. Nevertheless, Appellant’s claims fail. Assuming\\n\\nwithout deciding that the trial court’s receipt of and response to the\\n\\njury note outside the presence of Appellant and his counsel violated\\n\\nAppellant’s right to be present under the Georgia Constitution and\\n\\nhis right to effective assistance of counsel under the United States\\n\\nConstitution, these errors were harmless under the applicable\\n\\nstandards of review explained above.\\n\\n\\n      6 As we explained at length in Champ v. State, \\n310 Ga. 832\\n (\\n854 SE2d\\n\\n706\\n) (2021), we have been inconsistent regarding whether the presumption of\\nharm arising from a violation of the defendant’s right to be present is\\nrebuttable. See Champ, 310 Ga. at 845 (2) (c) n.10. There, we noted that while\\nGeorgia courts “began saying more consistently and squarely that violations of\\nthe Georgia Constitution’s right to be present are not subject to harmless error\\nanalysis” by the late 1990s, “this Court and the Court of Appeals have\\ncontinued to treat one type of right-to-be-present violation — communications\\nbetween trial courts and jurors without the defendant present — as subject to\\na rebuttable presumption of prejudice.” Id. We further stated that “[i]t is not\\nclear . . . whether the automatic-reversal position . . . is the correct rule for all\\ncases, for certain categories of cases, or for no cases. We would be amenable to\\nreconsidering our recent holdings in a case in which the issue is fully briefed.”\\nId. Here, Appellant cites Hanifa and Carter for the proposition that a\\nrebuttable presumption of harm applies. Because Appellant does not ask us to\\nreconsider these cases or to otherwise resolve our caselaw regarding whether\\nthe presumption of harm is rebuttable, we decline to do so here. But, as we said\\nin Champ, id., we remain amenable to such arguments if properly raised in a\\nfuture case.\\n                                         30\\n      (i) We turn first to Appellant’s right-to-counsel claim. The\\n\\nassumed violation of Appellant’s right to counsel arose from the trial\\n\\ncourt’s response to the jury note outside the presence of counsel.\\n\\nThat note concerned the mechanical process of completing the\\n\\nverdict form, rather than the law regarding the charges presented.\\n\\nAnd the trial court’s response — which directed the jury to leave\\n\\nblank the portion of the verdict form corresponding to voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter if it found the defendant guilty of felony murder —\\n\\nconcerned that same mechanical process.\\n\\n     By responding to the jury without consulting counsel, the trial\\n\\ncourt deprived Appellant of the opportunity to inspect the note, to\\n\\noffer a proposed response, or to object to the trial court’s response.\\n\\nSee Phillips v. Harmon, \\n297 Ga. 386\\n, 392-393 (I) (B) (\\n774 SE2d 596\\n)\\n\\n(2015) (explaining the consequences of a court’s failure to disclose a\\n\\njury note to the parties and their counsel). We have already\\n\\nconcluded, however, that in the context of the instructions as a\\n\\nwhole, the court’s substantive response to the jury’s note was not\\n\\nincorrect and was within the trial court’s discretion. See Division 2\\n\\n                                 31\\n (b) (ii), supra. It is therefore unclear what guidance, if any,\\n\\nAppellant or Appellant’s trial counsel could have provided the court\\n\\nwith respect to its response that would have altered the outcome of\\n\\nthe proceedings, and Appellant does not propose any such guidance\\n\\non appeal. We also consider that though the trial court did not\\n\\ndisclose the note until after it dismissed the jury, it did ultimately\\n\\ninform counsel. This disclosure permitted Appellant’s counsel to\\n\\nrequest that the note be made a part of the record and to object to\\n\\nthe court’s procedure. Though the court did not permit Appellant’s\\n\\ncounsel to articulate the grounds of his motion for mistrial, the\\n\\ncourt’s disclosure ensured that Appellant could litigate the\\n\\ncorrectness of the trial court’s response at the motion for new trial\\n\\nand on appeal, as he did. Each of these considerations leads us to\\n\\nthe conclusion that this assumed error was harmless. Compare\\n\\nPhillips, \\n297 Ga. at 393\\n (I) (B) (concluding there was harmful error\\n\\nwhere the jury’s note was not preserved and differing recollections\\n\\nof the timing of the note meant that the plaintiffs were unable to\\n\\nlitigate whether the trial court properly responded to the note).\\n\\n                                 32\\n      Further, and more importantly, we have held that when the\\n\\njury has been charged on voluntary manslaughter and it “returns a\\n\\nverdict of malice murder, it, of necessity, finds that the defendant\\n\\ncommitted the homicide without the provocation sufficient to\\n\\nauthorize a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter.” Terry v.\\n\\nState, \\n263 Ga. 294\\n, 294 (1) (\\n430 SE2d 731\\n) (1993) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). See also Stanley v. State, \\n300 Ga. 587\\n, 591 (2)\\n\\n(\\n797 SE2d 98\\n) (2017) (same); Johnson v. State, \\n300 Ga. 665\\n, 668 (4)\\n\\n(a) (\\n797 SE2d 903\\n) (2017) (same); Dyal v. State \\n297 Ga. 184\\n, 187-188\\n\\n(4) (\\n773 SE2d 249\\n) (2015) (same). This is so because, as the court\\n\\ninstructed the jury, “[l]egal malice . . . is an unlawful intention to\\n\\nkill without justification, excuse, or mitigation.” (Emphasis\\n\\nsupplied.) See, e.g., Tessmer v. State, \\n273 Ga. 220\\n, 222 (2) (\\n539 SE2d\\n\\n816\\n) (2000) (“Malice means the intent to take a life without legal\\n\\njustification or mitigation.”); Bailey v. State, \\n70 Ga. 617\\n, 621 (2)\\n\\n(1883) (“[M]alice . . . . is an unlawful intention to kill, without\\n\\njustification, or mitigation.”). Thus it was the jury’s finding that\\n\\nAppellant killed his girlfriend with malice, rather than the\\n\\n                                 33\\n potentially faulty verdict form, that eliminated a determination that\\n\\nAppellant was guilty only of voluntary manslaughter. See Dyal, \\n297\\n\\nGa. at 188\\n (4). Cf. Swayzer, \\n263 Ga. 690\\n, 691 (1) (\\n436 SE2d 652\\n)\\n\\n(1993) (holding that because the jury found the defendant guilty of\\n\\nmalice murder, any error in giving an improperly sequential jury\\n\\ncharge   in   connection   with   felony   murder    and   voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter was harmless). We therefore conclude that the error\\n\\narising from the trial court’s assumed violation of Appellant’s right\\n\\nto counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States is\\n\\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n     (ii) Many of these same considerations affect our analysis of the\\n\\nharm that arose from the trial court’s assumed violation of\\n\\nAppellant’s right to be present. As stated above, we apply a\\n\\nrebuttable presumption of harm where the court engages in a\\n\\nsubstantive communication with the jury outside the presence of the\\n\\ndefendant. See Hanifa, \\n269 Ga. at 807\\n (6). Even where the\\n\\ncommunication is substantive, however, the presumption of harm\\n\\nthat arises may be overcome by evidence that the communication\\n\\n                                  34\\n did not affect the outcome of the trial. See Waldrip, \\n266 Ga. at\\n877-\\n\\n879 (2). In Waldrip, the trial court attended lunch with the jurors at\\n\\nthe hotel at which they were sequestered, outside the presence of\\n\\nthe defendant and his counsel. \\nId. at 877\\n (2). The judge later\\n\\ninformed the parties and explained that he and the jurors had\\n\\nengaged in “informal chitchat” unrelated to the case. \\nId.\\n Defense\\n\\ncounsel immediately moved for a mistrial, but his motion was\\n\\ndenied. \\nId.\\n After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the trial court\\n\\nquestioned each of the jurors on the record about his or her\\n\\nrecollection of this lunch. \\nId.\\n Though many of the jurors could not\\n\\nrecall their conversations with the judge or confirmed that they had\\n\\nengaged in only small talk, one of the jurors testified that he told the\\n\\njudge that if his wife and granddaughter were to come to the area,\\n\\nhe “might have to break the law” related to his sequestration. \\nId.\\n\\n\\nAccording to this juror, the trial judge responded that he “might do\\n\\nthe same thing” if he were in the juror’s position. \\nId. at 878\\n (2). The\\n\\njuror testified, however, that nothing the judge said or did affected\\n\\nhis decisions regarding the verdict. \\nId. at 878, 879\\n (2). Each other\\n\\n                                  35\\n juror testified to the same. \\nId. at 877\\n (2). Notwithstanding its\\n\\nrecognition that a presumption of harm arose from the judge’s ex\\n\\nparte communications with the jury, see \\nid. at 878\\n (2), the Waldrip\\n\\nCourt concluded that the error was harmless because each member\\n\\nof the jury confirmed that there was no effect upon the verdict. \\nId.\\n\\nat 879\\n (2).\\n\\n     Turning to Appellant’s case, the court’s communications with\\n\\nthe jurors were substantive insofar as they concerned the process of\\n\\ncompleting the verdict form, but we have already concluded that the\\n\\ncourt’s failure to consult with counsel was harmless beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt because this failure did not affect the outcome of\\n\\nthe trial. See Division 3 (c) (i), supra. As explained above, the court’s\\n\\nresponse to the note was not incorrect; the court acted within its\\n\\ndiscretion to forgo further instruction; and the jury considered\\n\\nevidence in mitigation but nevertheless found Appellant guilty of\\n\\nmalice murder. Two conclusions follow. First, like his trial counsel’s\\n\\nabsence,      Appellant’s   absence     during   the   Court’s   written\\n\\ncommunications with the jury did not affect the outcome of the trial.\\n\\n                                   36\\n Second, because these communications did not affect the outcome of\\n\\nthe trial, the presumption of harm from the assumed violation of\\n\\nAppellant’s right to be present was overcome. See Waldrip, \\n266 Ga.\\n\\nat 879\\n (2) (concluding that the presumption of harm arising from the\\n\\ndefendant’s involuntary absence during a discussion between the\\n\\ntrial judge and a juror regarding sequestration had been overcome\\n\\nbecause the discussion did not affect the outcome of the trial). As\\n\\nsuch, we conclude that the presumption of harm arising from the\\n\\ncourt’s assumed violation of Appellant’s right to be present is\\n\\nrebutted by the evidence.\\n\\n     This result is not inconsistent with our decision in Phillips v.\\n\\nHarmon because that case is distinguishable. See Phillips, \\n297 Ga.\\n\\nat 392-393\\n (I) (B). There, the trial court responded to multiple notes\\n\\noutside the presence of the parties and their counsel, and we\\n\\nconcluded that the trial court’s violation of the civil defendants’ right\\n\\nto be present was harmful. See Phillips, \\n297 Ga. 393\\n at (I) (B).\\n\\nAmong our reasons for concluding there was harm, we noted that\\n\\nthe jury notes were not disclosed to the plaintiffs until several weeks\\n\\n                                   37\\n after the trial, that the court had failed to preserve one of those notes\\n\\nfor the record, and that the judge and some of the jurors had\\n\\ndifferent recollections about the nature and timing of their\\n\\ncommunications. See \\nid.\\n Unlike Phillips, these circumstances are\\n\\nnot present here: the note was disclosed immediately after the jurors\\n\\nwere dismissed, the court preserved the note as part of the record,\\n\\nand there is no dispute about the timing of the judge’s\\n\\ncorrespondence with the jury. Perhaps most importantly, we further\\n\\nstated in Phillips that “the inability to make a determination that a\\n\\nverdict for the Defendants was demanded, regardless of any effect of\\n\\nthe communication on the jury, support[s] Plaintiffs’ entitlement to\\n\\na new trial.” \\nId.\\n Here, we have made an opposite conclusion: a\\n\\nverdict for the State on voluntary manslaughter was demanded by\\n\\nthe jury’s determination, regardless of the court’s response to the\\n\\nnote, given the foreperson’s confirmation that the jury considered\\n\\nevidence in mitigation and the jury’s finding that Appellant\\n\\ncommitted malice murder. As such, it is appropriate to reach a\\n\\ndifferent result here.\\n\\n                                   38\\n Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                           39\\n '),\n",

WARD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n        LAGRUA, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant James Graham Ward appeals his convictions for\\n\\nfelony murder and other crimes related to two shootings that\\n\\noccurred on March 24, 2021—one of which resulted in the death of\\n\\nBrian Belin. 1 Ward contends on appeal that (1) the trial court erred\\n\\n\\n        1 On August 4, 2021, a Paulding County grand jury indicted Ward for the\\n\\nfollowing counts: malice murder of Belin (Count 1); felony murder predicated\\non aggravated assault of Belin (Count 2); aggravated assault of Belin (Count\\n3); aggravated assault of Shadeja Rutledge (Count 4); aggravated assault of\\nJewell Porter (Count 5); aggravated assault of Russell Jones (Count 6); and\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony (Count 7). The grand\\njury also indicted Ward and his co-defendant Annias Brooks—individually and\\nas parties concerned in the commission of a crime—for the following counts:\\naggravated assault of Belin (Count 8); aggravated assault of Rutledge (Count\\n9); aggravated assault of Porter (Count 10); aggravated assault of Jones (Count\\n11); and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony—\\nspecifically, the aggravated assault of Rutledge (Count 12). Ward and Brooks\\nwere jointly tried from March 14 to March 23, 2022. At trial, the jury found\\nWard guilty on Counts 2, 3, 7, 8, and 12 and not guilty on the remaining counts.\\nThe jury found Brooks not guilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced Ward\\nto life in prison without the possibility of parole on the felony murder count\\n(Count 2), plus a total of 20 consecutive years to serve for Counts 7, 8, and 12.\\nThe aggravated assault count (Count 3) merged with the felony murder count\\n in denying his request to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nbecause there was “some evidence” to support such a charge; (2) the\\n\\ntrial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on\\n\\nCount 8 (aggravated assault) and Count 12 (possession of a firearm\\n\\nduring the commission of a felony) because those counts were not\\n\\nsupported by the evidence and because his convictions on those\\n\\ncounts constituted repugnant verdicts since he was acquitted of the\\n\\nother aggravated assault charges based on the same conduct; and\\n\\n(3) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by agreeing to\\n\\nthe trial court’s ruling on the State’s motion in limine and by failing\\n\\nto file a “reverse 404 (b) motion” under OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) related\\n\\nto Belin’s propensity to carry firearms because this evidence was\\n\\nrelevant to Ward’s self-defense claim and prejudiced his ability to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Count 2) for sentencing purposes. Ward filed a timely motion for new trial,\\nwhich he later amended through new counsel on January 9, 2023 and April 17,\\n2023. After holding an evidentiary hearing on the motion for new trial, the trial\\ncourt denied the motion on August 21, 2023. Ward filed a timely notice of\\nappeal to this Court on September 8, 2023, and the case was docketed to the\\nDecember 2024 term of this Court and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                      2\\n support this defense at trial. Seeing no merit to these claims, we\\n\\naffirm Ward’s convictions.\\n\\n     The evidence presented at Ward’s trial, viewed in the light\\n\\nmost favorable to the verdicts, showed that, prior to the shootings\\n\\non March 24, 2021, Belin was spending the evening with his\\n\\ngirlfriend, Shadeja Rutledge, and a few friends. Rutledge, who\\n\\nstarted dating Belin in 2020, had previously been in an “on-\\n\\nagain/off-again” sexual relationship with Ward, which Ward\\n\\ndescribed as “friends with benefits.” Several months after Belin and\\n\\nRutledge started dating, Belin was incarcerated, and during that\\n\\ntimeframe, Rutledge and Ward saw each other again—but no more\\n\\nthan “once or twice.” When Belin was released from jail, he and\\n\\nRutledge resumed their relationship.\\n\\n     On the evening of March 24, Belin and Rutledge went to the\\n\\nhome of Russell Jones, a “close friend” of Belin’s, who lived with his\\n\\nparents in the Regency Park subdivision. Belin, Rutledge, and Jones\\n\\n“decided [they] were going to chill at [Jones’s] house” that night to\\n\\n                                  3\\n “drink and play music.” The group left the house briefly to purchase\\n\\nliquor and pick up Rutledge’s friend, Anisa Karim, and then\\n\\nreturned to Jones’s house. They were later joined by Jones’s\\n\\ngirlfriend, Jewell Porter. Around 8:00 p.m., Jones’s parents came\\n\\nhome, and his mother told the group to leave. According to Jones, he\\n\\nhad previously gotten into trouble with his parents because Porter\\n\\n“was caught spending the night,” and he was not allowed to have\\n\\ncompany at the house.\\n\\n     The group got into Belin’s car. Belin drove to the common area\\n\\nof the subdivision—an area next to the entrance of the subdivision\\n\\nwhere the swimming pool and tennis courts are located—and he\\n\\nparked the car. Jones was very angry about being forced to leave his\\n\\nhouse, and he and Belin got out of the car while Belin tried to calm\\n\\nJones down. Belin and Jones talked outside the car for about 10 or\\n\\n15 minutes, and then, the two men started walking along a paved\\n\\npath leading from the common area to other homes in the\\n\\nsubdivision. Rutledge, Karim, and Porter stayed in the car, listening\\n\\n                                 4\\n to music and talking. Rutledge testified that she did not see Belin\\n\\nand Jones walk away from the car, and according to Porter, she\\n\\n“los[t] sight” of where the men went.\\n\\n      As Belin and Jones were walking along the path, Jones heard\\n\\n“a [woman]’s voice coming from [a] house” adjacent to the common\\n\\narea, and Jones realized it was Ward’s house.2 Jones testified that\\n\\nhe and Belin did not intentionally walk to Ward’s house; they were\\n\\n“just walking and talking” when they heard a woman’s voice and\\n\\nsaw several people outside on the deck of the house, “playing music\\n\\nand stuff.” Jones and Belin approached the fence running along the\\n\\nbackyard of the house, and Belin asked the woman if Ward was\\n\\nhome. She said Ward was not there. Jones testified that “a lot of\\n\\npeople” from the house then came over to the fence and “started\\n\\ngetting rowdy” and “making threats.”\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 The record reflects that, on March 24, 2021, Ward’s mother, Stacy\\nMason, rented a house in the Regency Park subdivision, which backs up to the\\ntennis courts and swimming pool in the common area. Mason testified that\\nseveral of her children and her husband’s children lived with her in this house,\\nincluding Ward and his co-defendant Brooks.\\n                                      5\\n      Rutledge, Karim, and Porter—who were still sitting in Belin’s\\n\\ncar—heard “some noise” and “someone screaming,” so they got out\\n\\nof the car and followed the path until they came upon Belin and\\n\\nJones “arguing” and “talking to some dudes over the fence.” Rutledge\\n\\ntestified that she was concerned because Belin was “on probation”\\n\\nand was “extremely drunk,” so she grabbed his hand and told him to\\n\\ncome back to the car. Belin followed Rutledge towards the common\\n\\narea, but the rest of the group stayed at the fence. Jones testified\\n\\nthat he was “still arguing” with the people on the other side of the\\n\\nfence, and Porter was telling him, “[L]et’s go.” Jones testified that\\n\\nhe did not “trust the situation, so he didn’t “want to turn [his] back”\\n\\nand walk away.\\n\\n     Ward’s mother, Stacy Mason, testified that she was sitting in\\n\\nher bedroom talking to Ward on the evening of March 24 when it\\n\\n“came to [her] attention that something was going on outside of her\\n\\nhouse.” Mason testified that Ward “got a phone call” around that\\n\\ntime, and he answered the phone, “shook his head,” and “went out\\n\\n                                  6\\n of the room.” Ward and Mason went downstairs, at which point\\n\\nWard exited “out the front door and [Mason] went out the back door”\\n\\nonto the deck. Mason testified that “[t]here was a lot of yelling over\\n\\n[their] fence,” and “it was commotion just all in back of the fence.”\\n\\nMason said the people on the other side of the fence were “calling\\n\\nfor” Ward, and she told them to leave.\\n\\n     Rutledge testified that, when she and Belin got back to the\\n\\nparking lot in the common area, “a car pull[ed] up, and [Ward]\\n\\nhop[ped] out.” Ward approached Rutledge and Belin and “ask[ed] is\\n\\nthere a problem,” and she responded, “No. There ain’t no problem.”\\n\\nWard then started shooting at Belin. Porter testified that she saw\\n\\n“someone come running up” to Belin and Rutledge in the parking lot\\n\\nof the common area and heard “shots go off.” Porter said she could\\n\\nnot identify the person who was shooting, but she saw the person\\n\\n“pointing at” Belin and saw Belin “go to the ground.” Karim also\\n\\ntestified that, while she was standing by Ward’s backyard, she heard\\n\\nwhat she thought were “fireworks,” and when she turned around,\\n\\n                                  7\\n she saw “someone shoot at someone and then quickly run away.” She\\n\\ncould not see who the shooter was, but she heard Rutledge\\n\\nscreaming and yelling Ward’s name “over and over again.” Ward’s\\n\\nsister, Amyris Avritte, testified that she was outside their home on\\n\\nthe evening of March 24while an argument was going on at their\\n\\nbackyard fence, and she saw a car pull into the common area and\\n\\n“heard shots.”3 Mason also testified to seeing a “dark car” pull into\\n\\nthe common area parking lot and to hearing gunshots “over in the\\n\\nparking lot area.”4\\n\\n     According to Rutledge, after Ward shot Belin, she ran to grab\\n\\nher phone out of Belin’s car to call 911, at which point a second round\\n\\nof shots—which she assumed were intended for her—were fired.\\n\\nPorter and Jones testified that they also heard a second round of\\n\\n“shots pointed [their] way,” and Porter realized she had been struck\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     3 Avritte testified that she did not see Ward that night.\\n     4 According to Mason, Ward did not have a gun on him while he was in\\n\\nher bedroom that night and, “to [her] knowledge,” did not own a gun.\\n                                       8\\n with a bullet.” 5 Karim similarly testified that, moments after the\\n\\nfirst shooting, she heard “shots go again,” so she “duck[ed],” “roll[ed]\\n\\nover,” and hid behind some bushes by the tennis courts.\\n\\n     Jones testified that, after Porter was struck, he picked her up\\n\\nto carry her back to the common area, and as he was doing so, he\\n\\nsaw “Ward “hop into” a car, which went “peeling off” away from the\\n\\ncommon area and “out [of] the neighborhood.” Rutledge also testified\\n\\nthat she saw Ward “hop back into [a] car” in the common area, and\\n\\nKarim said she saw “a dark gray or a black van” in the common area\\n\\n“during the second shooting.”\\n\\n     Rutledge and Karim called 911,6 while Jones attended to Belin.\\n\\nJones “took up [Belin’s] shirt,” saw “bullet wounds and blood\\n\\nsquirting out,” and tried to “do CPR and pump [Belin’s] chest.”\\n\\nRutledge and Jones testified that Belin did not have a gun on him\\n\\nthat night and that they did not know him to ever “carry a gun.”\\n\\n\\n     5 Jones testified that a bullet “grazed” Porter’s back.\\n     6 Recordings of the 911 calls were played for the jury at trial.   During the\\nphone calls, Rutledge and Karim identified Ward as the shooter.\\n                                     9\\n       Ronnie and Janelle Scogin, who lived in the Regency Park\\n\\nsubdivision, 7 were at home around 8:30 p.m. on March 24 when they\\n\\nheard “seven or eight bangs” that sounded like “gunshots.” The\\n\\nScoginses stepped outside and “could hear young women crying\\n\\nreally, really loud” and screaming for help. Ronnie hurried “towards\\n\\nthe [common] area where [he] heard them crying,” and “as [he] got\\n\\nto the sidewalk, . . . [he] saw a guy get in a silver SUV and then come\\n\\ndown the road at a high rate of speed.” Ronnie next saw a “black\\n\\nSUV Ford Explorer with New York plates” drive up “right behind”\\n\\nthe silver SUV, 8 “heard several more shots,” and saw the black SUV\\n\\nleave the subdivision, followed by the silver SUV “maybe a minute”\\n\\nlater. Ronnie ran back to the house and yelled for Janelle to call 911.\\n\\nJanelle called 911 and advised the operator that there had been a\\n\\nshooting and that a black SUV with New York plates involved in\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 The Scoginses’ house was located a few houses away from the common\\n\\narea, between the house where Ward lived and the entrance to the subdivision.\\n      8 Mason testified that, during this timeframe, she was renting a silver or\\n\\ngray Nissan Pathfinder that Brooks was driving on March 24, and Ward was\\nrenting and driving a black Ford Explorer.\\n                                       10\\n that shooting was driving out of the subdivision. The Scoginses had\\n\\na motion-sensitive video camera installed on the front of their house,\\n\\nfacing the street, which recorded the events of March 24. The video\\n\\nfootage from the camera, which was played for the jury at trial,\\n\\ncaptured the sounds of multiple gunshots and screaming, followed\\n\\nby images of a black Ford Explorer and a silver Nissan Pathfinder\\n\\ndriving towards the common area, the sound of more gunshots, and\\n\\nimages of a black Ford Explorer and a silver Nissan Pathfinder\\n\\ndriving away from the common area and out of the subdivision on\\n\\nthe night of March 24. The Scoginses shared this video with the law\\n\\nenforcement officers investigating the case.\\n\\n        Around 8:30 p.m. on March 24, law enforcement officers with\\n\\nthe Paulding County Sheriff’s Office received a call regarding a\\n\\nhomicide in the common area of the Regency Park subdivision.\\n\\nDetective Jacob Martin, one of the first responding officers, testified\\n\\nthat:\\n\\n        [o]nce I arrived on the scene, a female identified as\\n        Shadeja Rutledge ran down the hill screaming and saying\\n                                  11\\n      that her boyfriend had been shot in the head and he is\\n     dying. I ran up the hill area at the tennis courts and I\\n     observed that there was a male lying on the ground and\\n     he was bleeding with shell casings around him and\\n     appeared to be lifeless. A male identified as ‘Russell\\n     Jones’ was on top of him trying to give CPR. I observed\\n     two other females on the side.\\n\\n     Emergency medical services soon arrived and “attempted to\\n\\nrender aid” to Belin, but he was deceased. The medical examiner\\n\\ntestified that Belin sustained a total of four gunshot wounds—one\\n\\nin “the anterior upper chest,” one in “the right side of the lower\\n\\nabdomen,” one in “the left side of the head,” and one in “the left side\\n\\nof the back”—as well as “shrapnel injuries” in his left hand.\\n\\nAccording to the medical examiner, “each one of the gunshot wounds\\n\\nin and of themselves would have been fatal,” but “the collective of all\\n\\nof them [was] what led to [Belin’s] death.”\\n\\n     Detective Gregory Pauch, a crime scene technician, testified\\n\\nthat he collected 9mm shell casings from around Belin’s body, “in\\n\\nthe vicinity of the tennis courts,” and in the roadway. Detective\\n\\nPauch testified that some of the 9mm shell casings he discovered\\n\\n                                  12\\n were aluminum or metal, while others were brass, which led\\n\\ninvestigators to believe that two guns might be involved. At trial,\\n\\nthe GBI firearms examiner testified that, after examining the shell\\n\\ncasings recovered during the autopsy and the shell casings collected\\n\\nfrom the crime scene area, she was able to establish that all the shell\\n\\ncasings were fired from Smith & Wesson 9mm pistols. However, the\\n\\nshell casings located inside and around the victim’s body and in the\\n\\ncommon area, and the shell casings located in the roadway were\\n\\nfired from two different firearms. No weapons were found on the\\n\\nscene, and neither the murder weapon nor any other weapon\\n\\ninvolved in the shootings was ever recovered by law enforcement.\\n\\n     Law enforcement officers learned that Ward was driving a\\n\\nblack Ford Explorer with New York plates on the night of the\\n\\nshooting. During the early morning hours of March 25, law\\n\\nenforcement officers located Ward and co-defendant Brooks at the\\n\\nhome of Shayla George, and Ward was arrested and taken into\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  13\\n custody.9 While he was in custody, Ward was swabbed for the\\n\\npresence of gunshot residue (“GSR”). At trial, Kimberly Jewett, a\\n\\nGBI expert in microanalysis, testified that GSR testing revealed\\n\\n“four particles characteristic of gunshot primer residue” on Ward’s\\n\\nhands, which meant that “either he discharged a firearm or he was\\n\\nin the presence of a discharging firearm or he came into contact with\\n\\nan item whose surface bears GSR[,] which would be like a recently\\n\\ndischarged firearm.”\\n\\n     Shortly after Ward’s arrest, law enforcement officers obtained\\n\\nand executed a search warrant at George’s residence, and during\\n\\ntheir search, they located Brooks’s cell phone, as well as a gray or\\n\\nsilver Nissan Pathfinder parked inside the garage. George testified\\n\\nthat Brooks drove the Pathfinder to her house on the night of March\\n\\n24, and at some point during the night, he moved the vehicle into\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     9  At that time, Brooks was not a suspect in the shootings. When\\nDetective Dickson later interviewed Brooks about the events of March 24,\\nDetective Dickson came to suspect that Brooks was a second shooter and took\\nhim into custody during the interview.\\n                                     14\\n the garage.10 George also testified that Ward arrived at her house\\n\\nabout “an hour and 45 minutes” after Brooks, but she did not know\\n\\nhow Ward got there.\\n\\n     On the morning of March 25, law enforcement officers located\\n\\nWard’s Ford Explorer at a local park. After obtaining a search\\n\\nwarrant for the Ford Explorer and removing its computer system—\\n\\nfrom which geolocation data was subsequently downloaded— law\\n\\nenforcement officers found a black handgun holster in the pocket\\n\\nbehind the driver’s seat, as well as personal items belonging to\\n\\nWard, including Ward’s driver’s license. Law enforcement officers\\n\\nalso swabbed the interior and exterior of the Ford Explorer to test\\n\\nfor the presence of GSR, which testing revealed “four particles of\\n\\ngunshot primer residue” on the driver’s side panel and steering\\n\\nwheel of the vehicle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     10 Mason testified that she spoke to Brooks by phone on the night of the\\n\\nshootings, and she told him to park the Pathfinder in the garage at George’s\\nhouse because it was “linked” to Mason as the renter of the vehicle.\\n                                     15\\n      On March 30, 2021, law enforcement officers executed a search\\n\\nwarrant at Ward’s residence and located Ward’s cell phone. Law\\n\\nenforcement officers then obtained search warrants for the cell\\n\\nphones of Ward, Brooks, and Mason. Detective Tyler Brown, who\\n\\nwas admitted as an expert in geolocation analysis and forensic\\n\\nanalysis of electronic data at trial, testified that he reviewed and\\n\\nanalyzed the cell phone records in this case, as well as the\\n\\ngeolocation data taken from the Ford Explorer. Detective Brown\\n\\ntestified that the recovered data showed that, during certain periods\\n\\nof time, Ward’s cell phone and the Ford Explorer were “synced up\\n\\nto” one another. According to Detective Brown, the data recovered\\n\\nfrom Ward’s cell phone and the Ford Explorer also demonstrated\\n\\nthat, between approximately 8:20 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on the night of\\n\\nthe shootings, Ward’s cell phone and the Ford Explorer were\\n\\npositioned and traveled as follows: (1) the cell phone and vehicle\\n\\nwere first located near Ward’s residence; (2) the car and phone\\n\\ntraveled near the parking lot of the common area by the tennis\\n\\n                                 16\\n courts, but did not remain in one spot; (3) the car and phone left the\\n\\nvicinity of the parking lot and common area—traveling out of the\\n\\ncrime scene area and in the direction of the back of the subdivision;\\n\\n(4) the car and phone traveled near the common area and the\\n\\nentrance of the subdivision, “paused briefly,” and then traveled in\\n\\nthe direction of the exit of the subdivision; (5) the car and phone\\n\\ntraveled near the area around the park where Ward’s Ford Explorer\\n\\nwas located, after which there was “no more data for the Ford\\n\\nExplorer”; and (6) the cell phone then traveled near the northern\\n\\npart of Paulding County. Detective Brown testified that, about 15 to\\n\\n20 minutes after the shooting, Ward’s cell phone “didn’t\\n\\ncommunicate anymore, and it wasn’t used.” Additionally, Detective\\n\\nBrown noted that ten calls were exchanged between Mason and\\n\\nWard between 8:30 and 8:45 p.m. on March 24, and 27 calls were\\n\\nexchanged between Mason and Brooks during the same timeframe.\\n\\n     Ward testified in his own defense at trial. According to Ward,\\n\\non the evening of March 24, he had just “pull[ed] in the driveway” of\\n\\n                                 17\\n his house and had “run in” to “grab something out of [his] room” and\\n\\nthen “leave again,” when Avritte—who was outside in the\\n\\nbackyard—called him on the phone. Ward was inside talking to\\n\\nMason at the time, and Avritte said, “There’s people out here asking\\n\\nfor you and they’re cursing or whatever.” Ward said he did not think\\n\\nit was anything serious—he assumed it was “some of her little\\n\\nfriends”—but he decided he would drive over to the common area,\\n\\n“see what’s going on,” and try to diffuse the situation. Ward testified\\n\\nthat he got in his car and “went to the parking lot” by the common\\n\\narea, where he thought “it was going to be like a little situation with\\n\\nthe kids that my siblings went to school with or whatever.”\\n\\n     According to Ward, when he got to the parking lot, the\\n\\nfollowing occurred:\\n\\n     I went and I got out of the car and walked up the path—\\n     and started walking up the path and then I seen Mr. Belin\\n     and Ms. Rutledge and then I was just like—like, basically,\\n     I just asked him like, What’s going on—or basically,\\n     What’s your problem or whatever, and then he didn’t\\n     really say nothing. He was like, Who’s that and walked\\n     closer, and then he just lunged at me and hit me with the\\n     gun.\\n                                  18\\n Ward testified that, after “Belin came at [him]” and “hit him with\\n\\nthe gun,” they “tussled for like maybe 15 seconds.” Ward said he\\n\\nwas not armed, but he “took the gun from” Belin, and then Belin\\n\\n“backed up maybe like five or 6 feet and then he just lunged at\\n\\n[Ward] again and that’s when [Ward] shot him.” Ward testified that\\n\\nhe did not “have any intentions of fighting anybody,” and he was just\\n\\n“defending” himself.\\n\\n     When Ward’s trial counsel asked why several shots were fired,\\n\\nWard responded that he was “scared for [his] life,” so he “just shot\\n\\nuntil [Belin] dropped.” After shooting Belin, Ward said he “dropped\\n\\nthe gun and ran and hopped in [his] car and left.” Ward testified that\\n\\nhe thought about going back to his house, but he knew his “family\\n\\n[wa]s not going to be safe,” so he “left the neighborhood” and went to\\n\\nthe “courts at Ben Hill Park.” Ward said he left his Ford Explorer at\\n\\nthe park because he was “too shaken up to drive” and “asked a friend\\n\\nto drop [him] off” at George’s house. Ward recalled leaving his wallet\\n\\n\\n                                 19\\n and driver’s license inside the Explorer, but testified that he did not\\n\\nknow a gun holster was also in the vehicle.\\n\\n     On cross examination, Ward testified that he was “justified” in\\n\\nshooting Belin “because it was self-defense.” Ward insisted that he\\n\\nwas not in “like a heat of passion” nor had he “lost his control or\\n\\nanything.” Ward said, “[I]t was him or me,” and he “had to” shoot\\n\\nBelin. According to Ward, he was not sure where he shot Belin\\n\\nbecause he “didn’t really look.” Ward believed he shot Belin in the\\n\\nchest and “didn’t know anything” about the shots to Belin’s back,\\n\\nstomach, or head. Ward said he just “pulled the trigger” multiple\\n\\ntimes, acknowledging that he was responsible for shooting and\\n\\nkilling Belin, but emphasizing that he shot Belin in “self-defense.”\\n\\nWard testified that he was aware that—other than his trial\\n\\ntestimony—no other evidence or testimony had been presented to\\n\\nshow that Belin was armed on the night of the shootings.\\n\\n     As for the second shooting on the night of March 24, Ward\\n\\ntestified that he was not present, he “didn’t shoot at nobody,” and he\\n\\n                                  20\\n was not the one who shot Porter in the back. Ward admitted that\\n\\nthe video recording from the Scoginses’ house showed a black Ford\\n\\nExplorer driving towards the common area “right before the second\\n\\nshots” were heard and that he could hear the “second volley of\\n\\ngunshots” on the video. However, Ward insisted that he was “not\\n\\nthere at the time of the second shooting.”\\n\\n     1. On appeal, Ward contends that the trial court erred in\\n\\nfailing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, see OCGA §\\n\\n16-5-2 (a), 11 because his trial testimony constituted sufficient\\n\\nevidence of provocation for the issue of voluntary manslaughter to\\n\\nhave been charged to the jury. We see no merit to this claim because\\n\\nthere was not even slight evidence presented to support this charge.\\n\\nSee Smith v. State, \\n296 Ga. 731\\n, 737 (3) (\\n770 SE2d 610\\n) (2015) (“As\\n\\n\\n    11 OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) states, in pertinent part, that\\n\\n\\n\\n     [a] person commits the offense of voluntary manslaughter when he\\n     causes the death of another human being under circumstances\\n     which would otherwise be murder and if he acts solely as the result\\n     of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious\\n     provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable\\n     person[.]\\n                                       21\\n the evidence in this case does not rise to a level sufficient to support\\n\\na voluntary manslaughter charge, the trial court did not err in\\n\\nrefusing to give the charge requested.”).\\n\\n     At trial, Ward submitted a written request to charge the jury\\n\\non voluntary manslaughter. At the close of the evidence, the trial\\n\\ncourt held a charge conference and advised the parties that it would\\n\\nnot give the voluntary manslaughter charge because Ward’s trial\\n\\ntestimony demonstrated that he did not shoot Belin as the result of\\n\\n“serious provocation which was sufficient to excite [sudden] passion\\n\\nin a reasonable person.” The trial court did not charge the jury on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter, and Ward objected.\\n\\n     Later, in denying Ward’s motion for new trial alleging that the\\n\\ntrial court’s refusal to give this charge was error, the trial court\\n\\nrejected this claim, explaining that, to “merit a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge as a lesser included offense of malice murder\\n\\nor felony murder,” the evidence “must demonstrate the requisite\\n\\nprovocation.” The trial court determined that Ward failed to\\n\\n                                  22\\n demonstrate the “requisite provocation” at trial, and thus, the trial\\n\\ncourt properly denied Ward’s request for a charge on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. We agree.\\n\\n     If there is any evidence, however slight, to support a\\n     properly requested charge of voluntary manslaughter,\\n     then the trial court must give it. But a charge on\\n     voluntary manslaughter is warranted only where it can\\n     be shown that the accused was so influenced and excited\\n     that he reacted passionately rather than simply in an\\n     attempt to defend himself. A charge on voluntary\\n     manslaughter is not available to a defendant whose own\\n     statement unequivocally shows that he was not angered\\n     or impassioned when a killing occurred, and when the\\n     other evidence does not show otherwise.\\n\\nThompson v. State, \\n312 Ga. 254\\n, 257-258 (2) (\\n862 SE2d 317\\n) (2021)\\n\\n(quoting Beck v. State, \\n310 Ga. 491\\n, 496-497 (2) (\\n852 SE2d 535\\n)\\n\\n(2020)).\\n\\n     Here, there was not even slight evidence presented that could\\n\\nmeet this standard. At trial, Ward testified that, on the night of\\n\\nMarch 24, 2021, Belin was armed with a gun when Ward\\n\\nencountered him in the common area, and the two men “tussled”\\n\\nbefore the shooting occurred. Ward then testified      that he was\\n\\n                                 23\\n “justified” in shooting Belin “because it was self-defense,” and when\\n\\nasked on cross-examination whether he shot Belin in the “heat of\\n\\npassion” or whether he had “lost his control,” Ward plainly denied\\n\\nboth, insisting that “it was him or me” and that he shot Belin\\n\\nbecause he was “scared for [his] life.”\\n\\n      “This Court has repeatedly held that neither fear that\\n\\nsomeone is going to pull a gun nor fighting prior to a homicide are\\n\\ntypes of provocation demanding a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ncharge[,]” Funes v. State, \\n289 Ga. 793\\n, 795 (2) (\\n716 SE2d 183\\n) (2011),\\n\\nand Ward points to no evidence whatsoever of provocation other\\n\\nthan a tussle between him and Belin. “[A]cting out of fear is not the\\n\\nsame as acting in the heat of a sudden irresistible passion[,]” \\nid.,\\n\\n\\n“and only evidence of the latter supports a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nconviction.” Burke v. State, \\n302 Ga. 786\\n, 791 (2) (\\n809 SE2d 765\\n)\\n\\n(2018). See also Dugger v. State, \\n297 Ga. 120\\n, 123-124 (7) (\\n772 SE2d\\n\\n695\\n) (2015) (holding that, where the appellant claimed that he shot\\n\\nthe victim in self-defense, “not out of anger or other passion,” and\\n\\n                                  24\\n there was no other evidence supporting a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ncharge, such a charge was not warranted). For these reasons, we\\n\\nconclude there was “no error in the trial court’s failure to instruct\\n\\nthe jury that it might consider voluntary manslaughter.” \\nThompson,\\n\\n312\\n Ga. at 258 (2).\\n\\n     2. Ward next contends that the trial court erred in denying his\\n\\nmotion for a directed verdict on the aggravated assault and\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a felony counts\\n\\nrelated to the second shooting because the evidence was insufficient\\n\\nto establish that he was present when that shooting occurred. The\\n\\nrecord reflects that Ward did not move for a directed verdict at trial,\\n\\nso this enumeration is without merit. However, even if Ward had\\n\\nmoved for a directed verdict, we disagree that the evidence was\\n\\ninsufficient to support Ward’s convictions for aggravated assault\\n\\nand possession of a firearm as a matter of constitutional due process.\\n\\n     Ward also argues that the verdict was repugnant because he\\n\\nwas acquitted of the other aggravated assault charges related to the\\n\\n                                  25\\n second shooting. We conclude that the verdict in this case was not\\n\\nrepugnant, see Rutland v. State, \\n315 Ga. 521\\n, 522 (1) (\\n883 SE2d 730\\n)\\n\\n(2023), and this claim also fails.\\n\\n     The standard of review for the denial of a motion for a\\n     directed verdict of acquittal is the same as for\\n     determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\\n     conviction. Under this review, we leave to the trier of fact\\n     the resolution of conflicts or inconsistencies in the\\n     evidence, credibility of witnesses, and reasonable\\n     inferences to be derived from the facts, we do not reweigh\\n     the evidence, and as long as there is some competent\\n     evidence, even though contradicted, to support each fact\\n     necessary to make out the State’s case, the jury’s verdict\\n     will be upheld.\\n\\nEllington v. State, \\n314 Ga. 335\\n, 339 (2) (\\n877 SE2d 221\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted). See also Jackson v.

See \\nid.\\n\\n\\n     Accordingly, after properly viewing the evidence in the light\\n\\nmost favorable to the verdict, we conclude that the evidence was\\n\\nsufficient as a matter of constitutional due process for a jury to find\\n\\nWard guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of aggravated assault\\n\\nagainst Belin and possession of a firearm during the commission of\\n\\na felony against Rutledge. See Jackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n (III) (B).\\n\\nSee also Boyd v. State, \\n306 Ga. 204\\n, 207 (1) (\\n830 SE2d 160\\n) (2019).\\n\\n     Additionally, Ward’s claim that the verdicts rendered in this\\n\\ncase were repugnant is meritless. “‘Repugnant verdicts occur when,\\n\\nin order to find the defendant not guilty on one count and guilty on\\n\\nanother, the jury must make affirmative findings shown on the\\n\\nrecord that cannot logically or legally exist at the same time.”\\n\\nRutland, 315 Ga. at 522 (1) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\nHere, the jury’s verdicts were not repugnant. While the jury found\\n\\nWard not guilty of aggravated assault as to Rutledge but guilty of\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the aggravated assault of Rutledge,\\n\\n                                  29\\n these verdicts could “legally exist at the same time,” and the not\\n\\nguilty verdict does not require any specific findings by the jury. Id.\\n\\n     Instead, the jury’s verdicts were “inconsistent.” Rutland, 315\\n\\nGa. at 522 (1). “An example of ‘inconsistent verdicts’ is when a\\n\\ndefendant is convicted of possession of a firearm during the\\n\\ncommission of the crime of aggravated assault but found not guilty\\n\\nof aggravated assault.”    Id.   “Although this Court once viewed\\n\\ninconsistent verdicts as impermissible, this Court now allows\\n\\ninconsistent verdicts to stand,” because “it is not generally within\\n\\nthe court’s power to make inquiries into the jury’s deliberations, or\\n\\nto speculate about the reasons for any inconsistency between guilty\\n\\nand not guilty verdicts.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted). See\\n\\nalso Coleman, 286 Ga. at 295-296 (4) (concluding that, while the\\n\\nappellant “contends his conviction for possession of a firearm during\\n\\nthe commission of the crime of aggravated assault of [the victim]\\n\\ncannot stand in light of his acquittal of the underlying felony,”\\n\\nGeorgia has rejected the “inconsistent verdict rule,” and          an\\n\\n                                  30\\n appellant can no longer “attack as inconsistent a jury verdict of\\n\\nguilty on one count and not guilty on a different count”). As such,\\n\\nwe conclude that the jury’s verdicts on the aggravated assault of\\n\\nRutledge and possession of a firearm during the aggravated assault\\n\\nof Rutledge counts are permitted to stand.12\\n\\n         3. In Ward’s final contention, he asserts that his trial counsel\\n\\nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion under\\n\\nOCGA § 24-4-404 (b) to present “reverse 404 (b) evidence” related to\\n\\nBelin’s propensity to carry firearms and by failing to object to the\\n\\ntrial court’s pretrial ruling granting the State’s motion in limine\\n\\nregarding this issue.

State, \\n316 Ga. 452\\n, 457 (3) (\\n888 SE2d 517\\n)\\n\\n(2023).\\n\\n     (a) Prior to trial, the State moved to exclude any character\\n\\nevidence related to the witnesses, victims, and law enforcement\\n\\nofficers in this case. The trial court held a pretrial hearing on the\\n\\nState’s motions in limine on the first morning of trial. During the\\n\\nhearing, the prosecutor explained that the primary focus of the\\n\\nState’s motion in limine was Belin’s incarceration from late 2020\\n\\nuntil early 2021, which the State anticipated would be addressed\\n\\nduring trial because Belin’s incarceration “impacted his relationship\\n\\nwith [Rutledge].” The prosecutor indicated that the State would\\n\\n“affirmatively” discuss the fact that Belin was “locked up,” but\\n\\nargued that the “general rule” still prevailed—i.e., “the character of\\n\\nwitnesses, including victims, [was] not relevant.” The prosecutor\\n\\nnoted that the defense had not provided any discovery to the State,\\n\\nsuch as certified copies of convictions or any other documents that\\n\\n“could be used for proper impeachment,” so the State believed that\\n\\n                                 34\\n “any bad character of witnesses, victims, any police officers” was “off\\n\\nlimits.”\\n\\n     In response, Ward’s trial counsel argued that the defense had\\n\\n     some [photographs] of [Belin] with guns and [Ward’s]\\n     defense [was] that Mr. Belin brought the gun to the party\\n     rather than [Ward], and [Ward] would like to use those\\n     [photographs] as evidence, not for character, but for\\n     propensity to carry a gun, and also the conviction for\\n     having a gun on school grounds. We believe it is relevant\\n     to our defense.13\\n\\nThe prosecutor responded that there had “not been any reverse\\n\\n[OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (“Rule 404 (b)”] notice,” and he believed “that\\n\\nwould be required if [the parties were] going to go into—or there’s\\n\\ngoing to be any attempt to make pertinent any specific instances of\\n\\nalleged prior acts.”\\n\\n     In ruling on the State’s motion in limine, the trial court agreed\\n\\nwith the State that this “type of evidence would require maybe a 404\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     13 The record reflects that Ward’s trial counsel did not show any of the\\n\\nphotographs or documentation pertaining to a gun-possession disposition to\\nthe trial court or the State during the pretrial hearing.\\n                                       35\\n (b) notice, which requires [the defense] to put the State on notice.”14\\n\\nThe trial court also observed that it did not “know what exactly the\\n\\nrelevance of that evidence would be at th[at] point” since Ward had\\n\\nnot included self-defense in the requests to charge he filed before\\n\\ntrial. The trial court granted the motion in limine, advising that,\\n\\n      [i]f during the course of this case, something comes to\\n      light or there does appear to be a reason to revisit this,\\n      the court is certainly open to doing so if that becomes\\n      necessary, but that needs to be done outside the presence\\n      of the jury and [the parties] need to notify the court that\\n      [they] intend to do it prior to any attempts or any\\n      references to that.\\n\\nAt trial, Ward did not raise the issue of introducing any photographs\\n\\nor convictions of Belin as evidence.\\n\\n      In his motion for new trial, Ward contended that his trial\\n\\ncounsel “provided ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel\\n\\nfailed to file a [Rule 404 (b)] motion relating to [Belin’s] propensity\\n\\nto carry firearms.” 15 In support of this claim, Ward argued that “the\\n\\n\\n      14 We express no opinion as to whether a Rule 404 (b) notice to the State\\n\\nwould have been required under these circumstances.\\n     15 Ward did not specify in his motion for new trial what evidence his trial\\n\\n                                      36\\n heart of [his] defense was self[-]defense,” and thus, his trial\\n\\n“[c]ounsel’s failure to properly file a motion to introduce the\\n\\ncharacter of [Mr.] Belin related to the use of firearms under [Rule\\n\\n404 (b)]” fell below “the standard of what a reasonable attorney\\n\\nwould do under the circumstances and prejudiced Mr. Ward’s ability\\n\\nto support his self-defense claim” because that evidence was\\n\\n“probative”    of   “whether     a   reasonable     person   under   the\\n\\ncircumstances would have felt threatened sufficiently to justify the\\n\\nuse of deadly force.”\\n\\n     At the motion-for-new-trial hearing, evidence was presented to\\n\\nshow that Belin was arrested on May 25, 2018 and October 12, 2020\\n\\nfor, respectively: (1) possession of a firearm on school grounds after\\n\\nlaw enforcement discovered a firearm inside a motor vehicle\\n\\nassociated with Belin parked at the local high school; and (2)\\n\\npossession of a firearm after law enforcement discovered a firearm\\n\\ninside a motor vehicle associated with Belin parked on a street\\n\\n\\ncounsel should have sought to admit under Rule 404 (b).\\n                                     37\\n where law enforcement officers were responding to a noise\\n\\ncomplaint.16 Ward’s trial counsel testified that, during trial\\n\\npreparation, investigators in the public defender’s office ran a\\n\\ncriminal history report for Belin and “check[ed] social media for\\n\\nanything that might be out there.” Ward’s trial counsel stated that,\\n\\nbased on Belin’s criminal history report, he was aware of Belin’s\\n\\nMay 2018 arrest “for firearm on school grounds.” However, trial\\n\\ncounsel indicated that, while he knew Belin had been incarcerated\\n\\nin late 2020 for a probation violation, he did not know how Belin’s\\n\\nprobation had been violated or that Belin had been arrested again\\n\\nin October 2020. Ward’s trial counsel testified that he advised Ward\\n\\nbefore trial that evidence of Belin’s May 2018 arrest “wasn’t\\n\\nadmissible because the judge had ruled on a motion in limine that it\\n\\nwas not admissible,” and the defense was “not going to be allowed to\\n\\n\\n\\n     16 At the motion-for-new-trial hearing, the prosecutor advised the trial\\n\\ncourt that the State and Ward—through his motion-for-new-trial counsel—had\\n“agreed to stipulate” that Belin was “in custody” for the October 2020 charge\\nfrom October 12, 2020 until February 28, 2021, shortly before the crimes at\\nissue occurred.\\n                                      38\\n go into it.” When trial counsel was asked whether he thought it\\n\\nwould have been “proper to try and file a 404 (b) motion to try to get\\n\\nthat evidence in” based on Ward’s self-defense claim, trial counsel\\n\\nresponded that he did not consider filing a Rule 404 (b) motion\\n\\nbecause he “didn’t think it would do any good in view of [the trial\\n\\ncourt’s] ruling on the motion in limine already.” On cross\\n\\nexamination, Ward’s trial counsel confirmed that he argued during\\n\\nthe hearing on the State’s motion in limine that information about\\n\\nBelin’s incarceration “should come in,” but he “gathered from [the\\n\\ntrial court’s] ruling that [the court] was going to put a very tight\\n\\n[rein] on what [they] could get into with Mr. Belin,” and “the gun\\n\\nwas not one that I could get into.”\\n\\n     In the order denying Ward’s motion for new trial, the trial court\\n\\nnoted that, during the motion in limine hearing, Ward’s trial counsel\\n\\nstated that the defense had “some photographs” of Belin with guns\\n\\nand “a criminal case disposition for having carried a gun on school\\n\\ngrounds” that the defense wanted to use at trial to show Belin’s\\n\\n                                 39\\n “propensity to carry a gun,” but Ward’s trial counsel did not show\\n\\nthe trial court any such photographs or documentation. The trial\\n\\ncourt observed that, in ruling on the State’s motion in limine, the\\n\\ntrial court advised the parties that it would “revisit the issue” at trial\\n\\nif “a reason were to arise” for the court to do so, but Ward’s trial\\n\\ncounsel “did not later request [the trial court] to revisit the issue.”\\n\\nThe trial court then noted that, at the motion for new trial hearing,\\n\\n“evidence was presented about 2 instances in which Mr. Belin had\\n\\nbeen arrested for having possessed, constructively, a firearm,” but\\n\\nconcluded that this evidence did not demonstrate that Belin “had a\\n\\nviolent character trait” and would not have been “an essential\\n\\nelement of [Ward’s] self-defense claim.”          The trial court also\\n\\nconcluded that this evidence did not “indicate that Belin had ever\\n\\nused a firearm offensively against another person” or that Ward\\n\\n“had been involved in either incident.” The trial court further\\n\\ndetermined that evidence of Belin’s arrests and any photographs of\\n\\nBelin with guns “would not have been admissible under [OCGA §§\\n\\n                                   40\\n 24-4-404 (a) (2) or 24-4-405] to demonstrate that Mr. Belin had\\n\\nallegedly possessed a firearm during his fatal encounter with\\n\\n[Ward].”\\n\\n     On this basis, the trial court concluded that Ward’s trial\\n\\ncounsel was not deficient for electing not to file a Rule 404 (b) motion\\n\\nseeking to admit this evidence because “if the [d]efense had filed\\n\\nsuch [a] reverse Rule 404 (b) motion solely to try to show Mr. Belin’s\\n\\npropensity for possessing a firearm, such purpose would have\\n\\nconstituted sheer propensity evidence that [the trial court] would\\n\\nhave been authorized to exclude from trial.” The trial court also\\n\\nruled that “any marginal relevance or probative value of that other\\n\\nact evidence would have been substantially outweighed by the\\n\\ndanger of unfair prejudice” and, thus, “excludable under OCGA § 24-\\n\\n4-403.” The trial court further determined that, “even pretermitting\\n\\nany deficiency in this regard, [Ward] ha[d] not established the\\n\\nprejudice prong” of Strickland.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  41\\n       On appeal, Ward contends that his trial counsel was deficient\\n\\nin conceding to the trial court’s pretrial ruling on the State’s motion\\n\\nin limine and in failing to file a Rule 404 (b) motion to introduce\\n\\nevidence of Belin’s prior “gun charge” because this evidence was\\n\\nadmissible to show “the character of Mr. Belin related to the use of\\n\\nfirearms” and Belin’s “propensity to carry firearms” and was\\n\\nrelevant to Ward’s self-defense claim. 17 Ward further argues that\\n\\nhis trial counsel’s failure to seek to admit this evidence prejudiced\\n\\nWard’s ability to support his self-defense claim. We see no merit to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      17 In his briefing, Ward does not mention any photographs of Belin “with\\n\\nguns”—i.e., the photographs referenced by his trial counsel during the motion\\nin limine hearing—or argue that those photographs would have been\\nadmissible under Rule 404 (b) had his trial counsel filed the requisite Rule 404\\n(b) motion, so we assume Ward has abandoned any such claim on appeal. See\\nHarris v. State, \\n313 Ga. 653\\n, 665 (6) n.13 (\\n872 SE2d 732\\n) (2022) (noting that\\nappellant abandoned any claim that a Brady violation occurred with respect to\\nrecords from his prior trial “by failing to make any argument in support of it\\non appeal”) (citing former Supreme Court Rule 22 (“Any enumerated error not\\nsupported by argument or citation of authority in the brief shall be deemed\\nabandoned.”)). Additionally, Ward does not make any argument or cite to any\\nlegal authority in support of his contention that his trial counsel was\\nineffective by failing to object to the trial court’s pretrial ruling granting the\\nState’s motion in limine; thus, we assume this claim is similarly abandoned.\\nSee \\nid.\\n\\n                                        42\\n these contentions, as Ward has not shown that this evidence would\\n\\nhave been admissible at trial.\\n\\n     (b) First, although OCGA § 24-4-404 (a) (2) provides that “an\\n\\naccused may offer evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the\\n\\nalleged victim, for the purpose of proving action in conformity\\n\\ntherewith,” that evidence “is generally limited [by OCGA § 24-4-405\\n\\n(a)] to testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an\\n\\nopinion.” Copeland, 316 Ga. at 458 (3) (b) (citing OCGA §§ 24-4-404\\n\\n(a) (2) and 24-4-405 (a); punctuation omitted). See also Wofford v.\\n\\nState, \\n305 Ga. 694\\n, 698 (2) (c) (\\n827 SE2d 652\\n) (2019) (“Character\\n\\nabout a victim generally is limited to reputation or opinion, not\\n\\nspecific bad acts.”). And, in cases where an accused is arguing self-\\n\\ndefense, the accused may only seek to introduce evidence of the\\n\\nvictim’s violent character through the admission of “reputation and\\n\\nopinion testimony.” Strong v. State, \\n309 Ga. 295\\n, 313-314 (3) (\\n845\\n\\nSE2d 653\\n) (2020).    We have held that “‘specific instances’ of a\\n\\nvictim’s conduct,” Copeland, 316 Ga. at 458 (3) (b) (quoting OCGA §\\n\\n                                 43\\n 24-4-405 (b)), are not admissible where the accused is arguing self-\\n\\ndefense because “a victim’s violent character is not an essential\\n\\nelement of a self-defense claim.” Strong, 390 Ga. at 313-314 (3)\\n\\n(holding that OCGA § 24-4-404 (a) “allowed [an a]ppellant to offer\\n\\nevidence of [the victim’s] violent character, as that trait was\\n\\npertinent to [the a]ppellant’s claim of self-defense,” but OCGA § 24-\\n\\n4-405 (a) required that this trait be “proved only with reputation and\\n\\nopinion testimony”; emphasis in original).\\n\\n     Here, to the extent Belin’s purportedly violent character was\\n\\npertinent to Ward’s claim of self-defense at trial, Ward could only\\n\\nprove this character trait “by reputation and opinion testimony,”\\n\\nwhich Ward never sought to do and does not argue his trial counsel\\n\\nshould have done. Strong, 309 Ga. at 313-314 (3). See also Beck,\\n\\n310 Ga. at 498 (3). Instead, Ward argues that his trial counsel\\n\\nshould have sought to prove Belin’s purportedly violent character\\n\\nthrough the admission of his prior gun charge, which was not\\n\\nadmissible for this purpose. See Strong, 309 Ga. at 313-314 (3).\\n\\n                                 44\\n And, because Belin’s prior gun charge was not admissible for this\\n\\npurpose, Ward’s trial counsel was not deficient in failing to introduce\\n\\nevidence of this prior conviction at trial. See Wofford, \\n305 Ga. at 699\\n\\n\\n(2) (c) (“Absent a showing that these prior convictions would have\\n\\nbeen admissible at trial, [the appellant] cannot prove that his lawyer\\n\\nrendered ineffective assistance when he failed to present evidence of\\n\\nthe prior convictions.”).\\n\\n     (c) Additionally, we have held that “[s]pecific instances of a\\n\\nvictim’s past conduct may also be admitted, not to show the victim’s\\n\\naction in conformity therewith, but rather [to] establish the\\n\\ndefendant’s state of mind and the reasonableness of the defendant’s\\n\\nuse of force.” Copeland, 316 Ga. at 458 (3) (b) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). See also OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (allowing\\n\\nevidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts” to be “offered to prove the\\n\\ncircumstances immediately surrounding the charged crime, motive,\\n\\nor prior difficulties between the accused and the alleged victim”).18\\n\\n\\n     18 As we did in Roberts v. State, \\n305 Ga. 257\\n, 260 (3) (\\n824 SE2d 326\\n)\\n\\n                                   45\\n However, “[b]ecause such evidence is offered as proof of the\\n\\ndefendant’s state of mind at the time of the charged crime, it is only\\n\\nadmissible if there is proof that the defendant actually knew about\\n\\nthe victim’s prior acts at that time.” Copeland, 316 Ga. at 458-459\\n\\n(3) (b).\\n\\n      Here, there is no evidence that Ward “was aware at the time of\\n\\nthe shooting[]” of Belin’s 2018 conviction, “so the conviction[] would\\n\\nnot have been admissible to show” Ward’s “state of mind or the\\n\\nreasonableness of his conduct” when he shot Belin in March 2021.\\n\\nWofford, \\n305 Ga. at 698\\n (2) (c) (citing OCGA § 24-4-404 (b)). Given\\n\\nthat nothing in the record shows that Ward “actually knew” about\\n\\nBelin’s prior conviction, Copeland, 316 Ga. at 459 (3) (b), or had\\n\\n“personal knowledge” of “any specific acts of violence” by Belin at the\\n\\ntime the shooting occurred, Ward’s claim of ineffective assistance\\n\\nbased on his counsel’s alleged failure to seek to introduce evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2019), we again assume without deciding that Rule 404 applies to evidence\\nregarding the other acts of a victim or third party.\\n                                       46\\n of this conviction fails. Beck, 310 Ga. at 498 (3) (concluding that,\\n\\nonly where “the defendant had personal knowledge” of “a victim’s\\n\\nspecific acts of violence,” will those acts potentially “be admissible to\\n\\nshow the defendant’s state of mind with respect to self-defense”).\\n\\n     For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that, because\\n\\nWard failed to establish that “his counsel performed in an objectively\\n\\nunreasonable way considering all the circumstances and in light of\\n\\nprevailing professional norms,” Ward has failed to prove that his\\n\\ncounsel performed deficiently. Ward, 313 Ga. at 273 (4). See also\\n\\nCopeland, 316 Ga. at 456 (3) (“To overcome the strong presumption\\n\\nthat counsel performed reasonably, the defendant must show that\\n\\nno reasonable lawyer would have done what his lawyer did, or would\\n\\nhave failed to do what his lawyer did not.”) (quotation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). Thus, Ward’s claim of ineffective assistance\\n\\nof counsel fails.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   47\\n '),\n",

According to Williams, her\\n\\nreinstatement will require the express support of the Florida\\n\\nLawyers Assistance Program and a showing of rehabilitation.\\n\\nMoreover, prior to making a showing of rehabilitation, Williams will\\n\\nbe required to undergo a comprehensive mental health evaluation.\\n\\n     Based on the discipline imposed in Florida, the Georgia Bar\\n\\ninitiated a reciprocal disciplinary action against Williams pursuant\\n\\nto Georgia Rule of Professional Conduct (“GRPC”) 9.4 (b), and, in\\n\\nresponse, Williams filed this petition for voluntary discipline. See\\n\\nGRPC 9.4 (b); Bar Rule 4-227 (b). In her petition, Williams explains\\n\\nthat, in Florida, she faced eight separate disciplinary matters, which\\n\\nshe summarizes as involving her failure to adequately communicate\\n\\nwith her clients, to competently and diligently represent those\\n\\nclients, to expedite litigation, to earn the fees that she had been paid,\\n\\nand to report two arrests in March and May 2017. She asserts that\\n\\n                                   2\\n the discipline as to those matters was mitigated by the absence of a\\n\\nprior disciplinary history; the absence of a dishonest or selfish\\n\\nmotive; personal or emotional problems, which she details; a timely\\n\\ngood faith effort to make restitution in that she made fee refunds to\\n\\nher clients; good character or reputation; physical/mental disability\\n\\nor impairment or substance-related disorder; interim rehabilitation;\\n\\nand extreme remorse. See ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer\\n\\nSanctions (“ABA Standard”), Standard 9.32 (a), (b), (c), (d), (g), (i),\\n\\nand (l).\\n\\n     Williams admits in aggravation of discipline that she engaged\\n\\nin a pattern of misconduct and committed multiple offenses, see\\n\\nABA Standard 9.22 (c) and (d), but she assures this Court that she\\n\\nhas taken steps to ensure future professional behavior in compliance\\n\\nwith all disciplinary rules. Asserting that she has not practiced law\\n\\nin Georgia since September of 2023, Williams requests that this\\n\\nCourt suspend her license to practice law for a period of 91 days,\\n\\nnunc pro tunc to February 10, 2024, and condition her reinstatement\\n\\non the provision of proof to the Office of General Counsel that she\\n\\n                                  3\\n has met the requirements for reinstatement as set forth in the\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2024 order of the Supreme Court of Florida.\\n\\n     The Bar responds by agreeing with the essence of Williams’s\\n\\nassertions in her petition and stating that Williams cooperated with\\n\\nthe Georgia Bar and expressed remorse during these proceedings.\\n\\nThe Bar contends that Williams’s requested discipline is sufficient\\n\\nto serve as “a penalty to the offender, a deterrent to others, and as\\n\\nan indication to laymen that the courts will maintain the ethics of\\n\\nthe profession,” In the Matter of Dowdy, 247 Ga. 488, 493 (277 SE2d\\n\\n36) (1981) (citation and punctuation omitted), and notes that the\\n\\nrequested discipline is “substantially similar” to the discipline\\n\\nimposed in Florida, see GRPC 9.4 (b) (3) (requiring the imposition of\\n\\n“substantially similar discipline” in reciprocal disciplinary cases\\n\\nunless the respondent makes certain showings not at issue in this\\n\\ncase). Therefore, the Bar recommends that the Court accept\\n\\nWilliams’s voluntary petition and impose the requested discipline.\\n\\n     Given that this Court has generally interpreted the Bar Rules\\n\\ngoverning reciprocal discipline to require the imposition of\\n\\n                                 4\\n substantially similar discipline as was imposed in the other\\n\\njurisdiction, see In the Matter of Van Dyke, 316 Ga. 168, 177 (886\\n\\nSE2d 811) (2023) (noting the “nature of reciprocal discipline matters\\n\\n. . . wherein this Court must only impose ‘substantially similar’\\n\\ndiscipline”), and because the Bar confirms Williams’s assertions that\\n\\nshe has not practiced law in this State since September 2023, this\\n\\nCourt accepts her petition for voluntary discipline and imposes a 91-\\n\\nday suspension with conditions, nunc pro tunc to February 10, 2024.\\n\\nSee id. (imposing suspension nunc pro tunc based on a showing that\\n\\nthe attorney voluntarily ceased the practice of law prior to the\\n\\nissuance of this Court’s suspension). Further, we condition her\\n\\nreinstatement on the provision of proof that she has met the\\n\\nrequirements for reinstatement as set forth in the January 11, 2024\\n\\norder of the Supreme Court of Florida. At the conclusion of the\\n\\nsuspension   imposed    in   this       matter,   Williams   may   seek\\n\\nreinstatement by demonstrating to the State Bar’s Office of General\\n\\nCounsel that she has met the conditions for reinstatement. If the\\n\\nState Bar agrees that the conditions have been met, it will submit a\\n\\n                                    5\\n notice of compliance to this Court, and this Court will issue an order\\n\\ngranting or denying reinstatement. See In the Matter of Topmiller,\\n\\n293 Ga. 667, 669 (748 SE2d 919) (2013). Williams is reminded of her\\n\\nduties under Bar Rule 4-219 (b).\\n\\n     Petition for voluntary discipline accepted; ninety-one-day\\nsuspension with conditions. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   6\\n '),\n",

HOOKS v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PINSON, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Kiervon Armani Hooks was convicted of felony mur-\\n\\nder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony,\\n\\nboth arising from the shooting death of Brandon Ray Foster.1 On\\n\\nappeal, Hooks contends the evidence was not sufficient to sustain\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 Foster was shot in the late hours of September 26, 2017, and died early\\n\\nthe next morning. On December 18, 2017, a grand jury returned an indictment\\ncharging Hooks with aggravated assault (Count 1), felony murder predicated\\non aggravated assault (Count 2), and possession of a firearm during the com-\\nmission of a felony (Count 3). At a jury trial from February 4-6, 2019, the jury\\nfound Hooks guilty of all counts. On February 6, 2019, the trial court sentenced\\nHooks to life without parole for felony murder (Count 2) and merged the ag-\\ngravated assault count into the felony murder conviction. Hooks was also sen-\\ntenced to serve five years in prison consecutive to his felony-murder sentence\\nfor possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Hooks, through\\ntrial counsel, filed a timely motion for new trial on February 11, 2019, which\\nhe amended through new counsel on April 13, 2023. Hooks waived hearing on\\nthe motion for new trial, and the trial court denied the motion on April 25,\\n2023. Hooks timely filed a notice of appeal on May 23, 2023. His appeal was\\ndocketed to the term of court beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a\\ndecision on the briefs.\\n his convictions because no physical evidence or eyewitness testi-\\n\\nmony linked him to the crime scene and the State did not present\\n\\nenough evidence to exclude the possibility that someone else shot\\n\\nFoster. But the evidence, which we recount in detail below, was con-\\n\\nstitutionally sufficient, so we affirm his convictions.\\n\\n     1. Near midnight on September 26, 2017, Dawn McCorkel was\\n\\ninside her apartment at the Garlington Heights apartment complex\\n\\nwhen she heard a gunshot “right next to [her] window.” She went\\n\\noutside five-to-ten minutes later, stepped off her porch, and saw\\n\\nsomeone was lying on the ground four-to-five feet away, on the left\\n\\nside of Building 60. She walked over to the person, Foster, whom she\\n\\nrecognized because he had been her neighbor for several years. Fos-\\n\\nter had been shot, but he was still alive, and McCorkel called 911.\\n\\n     Foster told McCorkel that “Buddha” shot him. McCorkel knew\\n\\nHooks as “Buddha.” She did not know anyone else who went by the\\n\\nnickname “Buddha,” although she said she had “heard of other peo-\\n\\nple in town with that nickname.” When Lieutenant Kylie Carter ar-\\n\\nrived at the scene, Foster was lying on the ground between\\n\\n                                   2\\n McCorkel’s apartment and Building 90 and had a gunshot wound to\\n\\nhis abdomen. Police found a spent .40-caliber shell casing near\\n\\nBuilding 90. McCorkel’s apartment was at the end of Building 60,\\n\\nwhich backed up to the rear of Building 90. Building 90 could be seen\\n\\nfrom McCorkel’s side window.\\n\\n     Lieutenant Carter asked Foster who shot him, and Foster said\\n\\n“Buddha.” Carter asked again, and Foster again said “Buddha” shot\\n\\nhim. The lead detective, Larry Hill, did not know who “Buddha” was\\n\\nat first. Another officer at the scene, Officer Matthew Brooks, knew\\n\\nthat Hooks, who used to be Officer Brooks’s neighbor at a different\\n\\napartment complex, now lived in Garlington Heights and went by\\n\\nthe nickname “Buddha.” Officer Brooks knew Hooks and his family\\n\\nand did not know anyone other than Hooks who went by the nick-\\n\\nname “Buddha.”\\n\\n     Although Officer Brooks did not know Hooks’s apartment num-\\n\\nber, he knew that Hooks’s sister lived in an apartment in Building\\n\\n90, which was the building the spent shell casing was found next to.\\n\\nOfficer Brooks went to that apartment, found the door was cracked\\n\\n                                 3\\n open, and knocked. Hooks answered the door and briefly spoke with\\n\\nBrooks. Hooks said that he had been inside his sister’s apartment\\n\\nall night, except for when he had stepped out to smoke a cigarette.\\n\\nPolice then searched the apartment but found no weapon.\\n\\n     Foster died from the gunshot wound to his abdomen later that\\n\\nnight. The medical examiner recovered a bullet that went through\\n\\nFoster’s abdomen and liver, then lodged in his right kidney and\\n\\nkilled him.\\n\\n     Brian Lepper, a GBI firearms and tool mark examiner, exam-\\n\\nined the shell casing collected at the scene and the bullet recovered\\n\\nduring Foster’s autopsy. Lepper determined that both were .40-cal-\\n\\niber and consistent with having been fired from a High Point .40-\\n\\ncaliber pistol or another brand of .40-caliber gun.\\n\\n     At trial, Detective Hill testified that Hooks was arrested for the\\n\\nshooting after investigators had exhausted other possible leads.\\n\\nMcCorkel, the neighbor who found Foster, identified Hooks in the\\n\\ncourtroom as the only person she personally knew as “Buddha” and\\n\\ntestified that it would have only taken “a second” to go from the\\n\\n                                  4\\n location where Foster was found to Building 90, where Hooks was\\n\\nthat night. Officer Brooks also identified Hooks in the courtroom as\\n\\nthe person he knew as “Buddha.” Also at trial, the State introduced\\n\\na to-scale computer-generated diagram of the crime scene, which\\n\\nhad been created based on measurements and photographs taken at\\n\\nthe crime scene. The photographs and diagram were admitted into\\n\\nevidence and an officer referenced them to point out the locations of\\n\\nBuildings 60 and 90, Foster, and the spent shell and their proximity\\n\\nto one another.\\n\\n     2. Hooks contends that the evidence was not sufficient to con-\\n\\nvict him of Foster’s murder because no physical evidence connected\\n\\nhim to the crime, and although Hooks went by the nickname “Bud-\\n\\ndha,” there was evidence that more than one person went by that\\n\\nnickname, and there was no evidence describing the shooter to es-\\n\\ntablish that Hooks—and not another “Buddha”—shot Foster.\\n\\n     (a) We review the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence by\\n\\nreviewing the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the ver-\\n\\ndicts to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found\\n\\n                                  5\\n the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, without weighing\\n\\nthe evidence or resolving conflicts in testimony. See Weems v. State,\\n\\n318 Ga. 98\\n, 101 (2) (a) (\\n897 SE2d 368\\n) (2024) (citing Jackson v. Vir-\\n\\nginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n, 319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979);\\n\\nByers v. State, \\n311 Ga. 259\\n, 266 (2) (\\n857 SE2d 447\\n) (2021)). To meet\\n\\nits burden, the State was “not required to produce any physical evi-\\n\\ndence,” so long as there was “competent evidence” to prove each ele-\\n\\nment of the crime. See Johnson v. State, \\n296 Ga. 504\\n, 505 (1) (\\n769\\n\\nSE2d 87\\n) (2015). We defer to the jury’s resolution of any conflicts in\\n\\nthe evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and the drawing of reason-\\n\\nable inferences from the facts. See Perkins v. State, \\n313 Ga. 885\\n, 891\\n\\n(2) (a) (\\n873 SE2d 185\\n) (2022).\\n\\n     A person commits felony murder when, “in the commission of\\n\\na felony, he or she causes the death of another human being irre-\\n\\nspective of malice.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (c). Here, the predicate felony\\n\\nwas aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, which occurs when\\n\\nsomeone “[a]ttempts to commit a violent injury” to another or “[c]om-\\n\\nmits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of\\n\\n                                  6\\n immediately receiving a violent injury” by use of a “deadly weapon.”\\n\\nOCGA §§ 16-5-20 (a), 16-5-21 (a) (2).\\n\\n     The evidence here, although largely circumstantial, authorized\\n\\nthe jury to convict Hooks of these offenses. Hooks points out that the\\n\\nmurder weapon was not found, and no witnesses saw Hooks outside\\n\\nBuildings 60 or 90 at the time of the shooting. But circumstantial\\n\\nevidence alone can be constitutionally sufficient, see, e.g., Weems,\\n\\n318 Ga. at 101 (2) (a)-(b), and the evidence here meets that standard.\\n\\nThat evidence showed that Foster was shot and killed with a .40-\\n\\ncaliber bullet when he was just outside McCorkel’s apartment,\\n\\nwhich was at the end of Building 60 and next to Building 90. A spent\\n\\n.40-caliber shell casing was found near Building 90, and Hooks an-\\n\\nswered the door of his sister’s apartment in that building and said\\n\\nhe had been there all night, except for when he went out for a ciga-\\n\\nrette. The jury viewed photographs and a to-scale diagram showing\\n\\nthe short distance between all the apartments in Building 90, in-\\n\\ncluding Hooks’s sister’s apartment, and the location of Foster and\\n\\nthe spent shell. Before he died, Foster said multiple times that\\n\\n                                  7\\n “Buddha” shot him, and multiple witnesses identified Hooks—who\\n\\nwas at his sister’s apartment a short distance away from where the\\n\\nshooting occurred and next to where the spent shell casing was\\n\\nfound—as the only person they knew who went by the nickname\\n\\n“Buddha.” Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdicts, this\\n\\nevidence authorized the jury to conclude that Hooks was the “Bud-\\n\\ndha” who shot Foster and to find him guilty of the felony murder of\\n\\nFoster predicated on the aggravated assault of shooting him, and for\\n\\npossession of a firearm during the commission of that crime. See Ro-\\n\\ndriquez v. State, \\n309 Ga. 542\\n, 546 (1) (\\n847 SE2d 303\\n) (2020) (con-\\n\\ncluding that sufficient evidence supported the felony murder convic-\\n\\ntion where circumstantial evidence, including cell phone records\\n\\nplacing the defendant at or near the crime scene, which was within\\n\\nwalking distance of his apartment, and a prior altercation between\\n\\nthe defendant and victim, authorized the jury to find that the de-\\n\\nfendant, and not another person, shot the victim). See also Hill v.\\n\\nState, \\n276 Ga. 220\\n, 221 (3) (\\n576 SE2d 886\\n) (2003) (“Evidence that\\n\\nthe defendant or an accomplice either carried or was within arm’s\\n\\n                                 8\\n length of a weapon during the commission of a crime authorizes a\\n\\nfinding of guilt of violating OCGA § 16-11-106 (b).”).\\n\\n     (b) When a conviction is based on circumstantial evidence, the\\n\\nState must present sufficient evidence to “exclude every other rea-\\n\\nsonable hypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.” OCGA §\\n\\n24-14-6. But “not every hypothesis is reasonable,” and whether a\\n\\ngiven hypothesis is reasonable is a determination for the jury that\\n\\nwe do not disturb “unless it is insufficient as a matter of law.” See\\n\\nDrennon v. State, \\n314 Ga. 854\\n, 861-862 (3) (\\n880 SE2d 139\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(cleaned up).\\n\\n      Hooks contends that the evidence against him was entirely cir-\\n\\ncumstantial and that the State did not exclude beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt the possibility that Foster’s identification of “Buddha” as the\\n\\nshooter could have referred to someone other than Hooks. See OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-14-6. Even if we assume that the evidence was entirely circum-\\n\\nstantial,2 Hooks’s nickname, which Foster gave to identify his\\n\\n\\n     2 Generally, an eyewitness’s identification of a defendant is direct evi-\\n\\ndence of guilt. See Bates v. State, \\n317 Ga. 809\\n, 814 (2) n.3 (\\n896 SE2d 851\\n)\\n\\n                                     9\\n shooter, was not the only evidence linking him to the crime. As we\\n\\njust discussed, Foster was shot with a .40-caliber bullet when he was\\n\\nbetween Building 60 and Building 90, a spent .40-caliber shell cas-\\n\\ning was found next to Building 90, and Hooks—whose nickname is\\n\\n“Buddha”—was at his sister’s apartment in Building 90 on the night\\n\\nof the shooting. In support of his hypothesis that another “Buddha”\\n\\nwas the shooter, Hooks points only to McCorkel’s testimony that she\\n\\nhad “heard of other people in town” going by the nickname “Bud-\\n\\ndha.” But McCorkel, who lived in the same apartment complex as\\n\\nHooks and Foster, clarified that Hooks was the only person she knew\\n\\nwho went by the name “Buddha,” and Officer Brooks, who had been\\n\\nHooks’s neighbor at a different apartment complex, testified that\\n\\nHooks was the only “Buddha” he knew. Also, the lead detective tes-\\n\\ntified that after learning that Foster had identified “Buddha” as the\\n\\n\\n\\n(2023). See also Gittens v. State, \\n307 Ga. 841\\n, 843 (1) n.2 (\\n838 SE2d 888\\n) (2020).\\n(“Eyewitness testimony based on the witness’s firsthand observations of the\\ncrime is direct, not circumstantial, evidence.”). For purposes of addressing\\nHook’s argument, we assume without deciding that Foster’s identification of\\nhis shooter by the nickname “Buddha” was circumstantial evidence because\\npolice then used that information and additional inferences to identify Hooks\\nas the “Buddha” Foster had referred to.\\n                                       10\\n shooter and that Hooks went by that nickname, he exhausted other\\n\\nleads before arresting Hooks for the murder. These identifications\\n\\nof Hooks as “Buddha,” combined with the close proximity between\\n\\nthe location of the spent shell casing that matched the fatal bullet\\n\\nand the apartment where Hooks was that night, authorized the jury\\n\\nto reject as unreasonable the hypothesis that another “Buddha” with\\n\\nno connection to the crime scene was the shooter. See Drennon, 314\\n\\nGa. at 861-862 (3). Given this evidence, the jury was authorized to\\n\\nreject Hooks’s theory that some other person with the same nick-\\n\\nname shot Foster. See Graves v. State, \\n306 Ga. 485\\n, 486-487 (1)\\n\\n(2019) (concluding that circumstantial evidence, including video\\n\\nshowing the defendant alone exit a taxi after the taxi crashed and\\n\\non the night the taxi’s driver was shot, was sufficient for the jury to\\n\\nreject his contention that there was another passenger in the same\\n\\ntaxi but not shown in the video who had shot the taxi driver). Cf.\\n\\nMoulder v. State, \\n317 Ga. 43\\n, 44-47 (1)-(2) (\\n891 SE2d 903\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(even without any physical evidence linking the defendant to the\\n\\ncrime scene or evidence that the defendant went by the nickname\\n\\n                                  11\\n “Youngster,” whom the victim said he was with before he was found\\n\\ndead, other evidence—including that the defendant knew the victim,\\n\\nused to live and had a family member who lived near where the vic-\\n\\ntim’s car was found, and had been in Georgia on the day of the shoot-\\n\\ning—was sufficient to authorize the jury to reject the defendant’s\\n\\nhypothesis that an unidentified person who went by the nickname\\n\\n“Youngster,” and not the defendant, was the shooter).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

ASHFORD KENDALL PERCY v. THE STATE.\\n       A grand jury indicted Ashford Percy for one count each of armed robbery and\\naggravated assault and two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission\\nof a felony. At trial, a jury found Percy guilty of aggravated assault and one of the\\nfirearm charges but was unable to reach a verdict on the other two counts, and a\\nmistrial was declared as to those charges. After the trial court sentenced Percy on the\\ntwo counts of which he was convicted, he filed a timely motion for a new trial, which\\nthe trial court denied. Percy then filed this direct appeal. The State has filed a motion\\nto dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.\\n       “[A] mistrial is not a final judgment or decision from which appeal will lie, as\\nthe cause of action is still pending in the trial court.”(Citation and punctuation\\nomitted.)

JONES v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       BOGGS, Chief Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Darious Jones challenges his 2016 conviction for\\n\\nfelony murder in connection with the beating death of Faith Parke.\\n\\nAppellant          contends          that       the      evidence          was       constitutionally\\n\\ninsufficient; that, due to his mental condition, the trial court erred\\n\\nby allowing him to decide whether to testify without further inquiry;\\n\\nthat the trial court erred in refusing to give the voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter-related instructions that he requested; and that the\\n\\ntrial court erred in sentencing him to life without the possibility of\\n\\nparole. However, as explained below, we conclude that the evidence\\n\\nwas sufficient because, among other things, Appellant arranged to\\n\\nmeet Parke at the location where she died; Appellant’s DNA and\\n\\nfingerprints were at the crime scene, including on a doorstop bar\\n near Parke’s body; and Parke had injuries matching the pattern on\\n\\nthe end of that doorstop bar. Furthermore, Georgia law does not\\n\\nrequire a trial court to advise a defendant concerning his right to\\n\\ntestify or to make the type of inquiry that Appellant asserts the trial\\n\\ncourt should have made here, and the trial court properly refused to\\n\\ngive       Appellant’s requested instructions regarding voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter because no evidence supported them. Finally,\\n\\nAppellant’s sentencing argument fails. Accordingly, we affirm.1\\n\\n       1. Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdicts, the\\n\\n\\n       1The crime occurred on May 12, 2015. On July 30, 2015, a DeKalb\\nCounty grand jury indicted Appellant for malice murder, felony murder, and\\naggravated assault. At a trial from August 29 to September 2, 2016, the jury\\nfound Appellant not guilty of malice murder but guilty of felony murder and\\naggravated assault. The trial court sentenced Appellant to serve life in prison\\nwithout the possibility of parole for felony murder. The aggravated assault\\ncount merged. Appellant filed a timely motion for new trial, which he amended\\nwith new counsel on July 6, 2021. On August 17, 2022, before the trial court\\nheld a hearing or ruled on the motion for new trial, Appellant filed a notice of\\nappeal. After an evidentiary hearing on August 11, 2023, the trial court\\nentered an order denying the motion on September 20, 2023. Appellant’s\\noriginal notice of appeal ripened upon the entry of the trial court’s denial of his\\nmotion, see State v. Hood, 295 Ga. 664, 664-665 (763 SE2d 487) (2014)\\n(explaining that a notice of appeal filed before a trial court denies a motion for\\nnew trial ripens upon a denial of that motion), and although Appellant was not\\nrequired to do so, he also filed a timely amended notice of appeal on October\\n16, 2023, after the trial court denied his motion. The case was docketed in this\\nCourt for the term beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision\\non the briefs.\\n                                        2\\n evidence at trial showed the following. On May 11, 2015, Appellant\\n\\ntexted and called Parke, arranging to meet and to pay her money in\\n\\nexchange for sexual acts. After texting and calling each other’s\\n\\nphones throughout the night and into the next morning, they\\n\\neventually agreed to meet on May 12 at a vacant house next door to\\n\\nwhere Appellant lived with his mother, and that Appellant would\\n\\npay $80 for 30 minutes of Parke’s time. A neighbor who lived across\\n\\nthe street from the vacant home testified that at around 9:00 a.m.\\n\\non May 12, she saw a young female wearing a striped dress and\\n\\ntalking on a cell phone park a PT Cruiser vehicle in front of the\\n\\nvacant house. The neighbor did not see the female enter the house.\\n\\n     A few hours later, Bernard Nguyen, a maintenance man,\\n\\narrived at the vacant home to prepare it for a new tenant. As he\\n\\nbegan cleaning on May 12, he noticed blood in an upstairs bathroom.\\n\\nHe then noticed blood near the stairs that he overlooked when he\\n\\nfirst went up the stairs. Not finding anyone upstairs, he checked a\\n\\ndownstairs bedroom, where he saw a woman later identified as\\n\\nParke face-down on the floor in a pool of blood. Nguyen called his\\n\\n                                3\\n wife and then 911. Nguyen further testified that the home had two\\n\\nsliding glass doors that led to the outside, one in the living room and\\n\\nanother in the bedroom where he found Parke’s body. Both sliding\\n\\nglass doors usually had matching metal doorstop bars that secured\\n\\nthem, and both bars were in place the day before when Nguyen left.\\n\\nOn May 12, however, the doorstop bar was missing from the door of\\n\\nthe bedroom where he found Parke.\\n\\n     Investigator Kelly Freeman of the DeKalb County Police\\n\\nDepartment responded to the scene. She observed that the doorstop\\n\\nbar was missing from the door in the bedroom where Nguyen\\n\\ndiscovered Parke’s body. However, she found the missing doorstop\\n\\nbar in the closet of that bedroom. In the kitchen trashcan, she found\\n\\nwhat appeared to be bloody paper towels, a condom, and a condom\\n\\nwrapper. Nguyen testified that when he left the house the day\\n\\nbefore, there was no blood anywhere inside, nor was there a condom\\n\\nin the trashcan. Investigator Freeman took photos of Parke’s head,\\n\\nincluding “possible brain matter” that was exposed due to a “defect\\n\\nto [Parke’s] head” and possible defensive wounds. Parke’s wounds\\n\\n                                  4\\n were so severe that Investigator Freeman could see directly into\\n\\nParke’s skull. Photos that Investigator Freeman took at the crime\\n\\nscene were admitted into evidence and showed that Parke was\\n\\nwearing striped clothing.\\n\\n     Sergeant M.S. McLendon of the DeKalb County Police\\n\\nDepartment testified that he obtained a search warrant for Parke’s\\n\\ncar and inspected her cell phone. He found the last phone number\\n\\nthat Parke’s phone contacted, discovered that the phone number\\n\\nbelonged to Appellant, and found Appellant’s address, which was\\n\\nnext door to the crime scene. Sergeant McLendon further testified\\n\\nthat he obtained a search warrant for Appellant’s DNA, went to\\n\\nAppellant’s house, and transported Appellant to the police station to\\n\\nexecute the search warrant. At the police station, Sergeant\\n\\nMcLendon noticed “cuts and injuries” on Appellant’s hands.\\n\\n     Jennifer Jones, Appellant’s mother, testified that Appellant\\n\\nwas about 21 at the time of Parke’s death, had “ADHD, . . .\\n\\nopposition defiant disorder, mild mental retardation, and . . . [a]\\n\\nlearning disability,” and graduated high school with a “transitional\\n\\n                                 5\\n diploma” for students with “disabilities that most likely would not\\n\\nbe able to pass the high school graduation test because their IQ is\\n\\ntoo low and they already know that they won’t.” Jennifer further\\n\\nrecalled that on May 16, police came to her house, which she shared\\n\\nwith Appellant and other relatives. An officer drove Appellant to the\\n\\npolice station, and Jennifer followed them to the station. Jennifer\\n\\ninformed police that Appellant “had a disability.”\\n\\n     On the way home from the police station that evening with\\n\\nAppellant, Jennifer “kept asking him what’s going on.” Appellant\\n\\n“had a frightened look on his face” and eventually told her that “it\\n\\nwas a accident. You know I wouldn’t hurt nobody.” Appellant’s eyes\\n\\nfilled with tears as he spoke. They drove home without talking\\n\\nfurther. When they got home and were walking into the house,\\n\\nAppellant said, “[I]t’s a bag in the garage.” Jennifer found a black\\n\\ntrash bag in the garage of her home but could not bring herself to\\n\\nopen it. The next day, Jennifer drove Appellant to the police station\\n\\nto “turn him in,” took the bag with her, and again told police that\\n\\nAppellant “ha[d] a disability.” Police obtained a search warrant for\\n\\n                                 6\\n the bag, which one officer testified smelled “like a decomposing\\n\\nbody,” and examined it.      Inside, officers found various items,\\n\\nincluding clothes, shoes, a washcloth, gloves, and a towel, which\\n\\nwere bloody. Police then arrested Appellant for murder.\\n\\n     At trial, Erica Turner of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation\\n\\ntestified as an expert for the State in latent print examinations.\\n\\nTurner identified Appellant’s fingerprint on the doorstop bar that\\n\\npolice collected from the closet of the bedroom where Parke’s body\\n\\nwas found. She also matched to Appellant a fingerprint on a piece of\\n\\nvinyl siding that was located on the outside of the house near the\\n\\nsliding glass door leading to that bedroom.\\n\\n     Betzaida Maldonado of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation\\n\\ntestified for the State as an expert in DNA analysis and typing.\\n\\nMaldonado testified that the condom police found in the trashcan of\\n\\nthe home contained Appellant’s DNA.\\n\\n     Dr. Gerald Gowitt, the chief medical examiner for DeKalb\\n\\nCounty who performed Parke’s autopsy, testified for the State as an\\n\\nexpert in forensic pathology. Dr. Gowitt explained that Parke’s\\n\\n                                 7\\n injuries were mostly “confined to the head and neck and right and\\n\\nleft arms” and that her injuries were “too numerous to count.” He\\n\\nfurther recounted that during the autopsy he discovered “pattern\\n\\ninjuries” on the left side of Parke’s head and face that matched the\\n\\nend of a doorstop bar recovered from the scene. The pattern injuries\\n\\nwere “entirely consistent with being struck with a significant\\n\\namount of force by the end of that pipe, not by the shaft part, but by\\n\\nthe end of that pipe, enough to bruise the skin and leave a mark on\\n\\nthe skin in the form of a bruise that looks like the end of the rubber\\n\\nstopper” on the doorstop bar, and Dr. Gowitt testified that he was\\n\\nfairly confident that Parke’s injuries were “made by the end of [the]\\n\\ndoorstop” bar. He also noted that Parke had a bite mark on her left\\n\\nelbow, that some of her injuries appeared to be defensive, and that\\n\\nshe had $50 in cash tucked underneath her clothing. Dr. Gowitt\\n\\nconcluded that Parke would have been “awake and aware of what\\n\\nwas happening to her” for a portion of the beating and that her cause\\n\\nof death was blunt head trauma.\\n\\n     2. Appellant first contends that the evidence was insufficient\\n\\n                                  8\\n as a matter of constitutional due process to support his conviction.\\n\\nSee Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560)\\n\\n(1979). In Appellant’s estimation, the State presented conflicting\\n\\nand questionable evidence at trial that might have confused the jury\\n\\nand did not authorize the jury to find that the State proved the\\n\\nessential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. “In\\n\\nevaluating a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter\\n\\nof constitutional due process, we view the evidence presented at trial\\n\\nin the light most favorable to the verdicts and ask whether any\\n\\nrational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt of the crimes of which [he] was convicted.” Lopez\\n\\nv. State, ___ Ga. ___, ___ (898 SE2d 441) (2024). Indeed, “it is well\\n\\nsettled that it is the role of the jury to resolve conflicts in the\\n\\nevidence and to determine the credibility of witnesses, and the\\n\\nresolution of such conflicts adversely to the defendant does not\\n\\nrender the evidence insufficient.” Reed v. State, 314 Ga. 534, 537\\n\\n(878 SE2d 217) (2022) (cleaned up).\\n\\n     The evidence presented at trial and summarized in part above\\n\\n                                  9\\n was sufficient to authorize Appellant’s conviction. The search of\\n\\nParke’s phone and testimony at trial showed that Appellant\\n\\narranged to meet Parke on the same day as and at the same location\\n\\nwhere the     maintenance man found         her body.    Appellant’s\\n\\nfingerprints were on the doorstop bar from the closet of the bedroom\\n\\nwhere Parke’s body was found as well as on the siding outside the\\n\\nroom, and Parke’s pattern injuries matched the design on the end of\\n\\nthe doorstop bar. See Reaves v. State, 292 Ga. 545, 545-546 (739\\n\\nSE2d 368) (2013) (holding that the evidence was sufficient to\\n\\nauthorize the defendant’s conviction for felony murder, relying, in\\n\\npart, on evidence that the child victim had pattern injuries, and the\\n\\npatterns matched a baseball bat and a broken umbrella police\\n\\nrecovered from the defendant’s home). Appellant’s DNA was also on\\n\\nthe condom police recovered from the trashcan. See Ballard v. State,\\n\\n297 Ga. 248, 248-249 & n.1, 255 (773 SE2d 254) (2015) (holding that\\n\\nthe evidence was sufficient to support conviction for felony murder\\n\\npredicated on aggravated assault, relying, in part, on evidence that\\n\\ndefendant’s DNA was on a water bottle in the hotel room, which\\n\\n                                 10\\n placed the defendant at the crime scene). The jury was not required\\n\\nto accept Appellant’s claim that the killing was an accident and\\n\\ncould have concluded based on the evidence recited above that he\\n\\nbeat Parke intentionally, causing her death. See Brown v. State, 291\\n\\nGa. 892, 895 (734 SE2d 23) (2012) (recognizing a jury’s authority to\\n\\ndisbelieve a defendant’s version of events and to accept the State’s\\n\\ntheory of the case). Accordingly, Appellant’s contention fails.\\n\\n      3. Appellant further argues that due to his “mental condition,”\\n\\nthe trial court erred by allowing him to decide whether to testify\\n\\nwithout some further inquiry than the one the trial court\\n\\nconducted.2 After the State rested, the trial court sent the jury out\\n\\nand asked Appellant whether he had discussed with his attorneys\\n\\nwhether he would testify or needed more time:\\n\\n      TRIAL COURT: I’ll go ahead and give Mr. Jones’s\\n      admonition now about testifying. Mr. Jones, please stand.\\n\\n\\n      2 Because the State does not argue that Appellant waived this argument\\n\\nby failing to object at trial and Appellant’s argument fails, we assume without\\ndeciding that this argument was preserved for ordinary appellate review.\\nCompare Gibson v. State, 290 Ga. 6, 9, 11 (717 SE2d 447) (2011) (holding that\\nthe defendant’s failure to make an objection at trial regarding the defendant’s\\ndecision not to testify waived the issue for appeal but addressing the merits of\\nthe defendant’s argument anyway).\\n                                      11\\n      Mr. Jones, I am assuming that you’ve had an adequate\\n     opportunity to discuss whether or not you’re going to take\\n     the witness stand with your attorneys, Mr. Queen and\\n     Mr. Tailor. However, I am under an obligation, a duty, to\\n     advise you that even though it’s not recommended that\\n     you ever do anything without consulting with your\\n     attorney first, the law requires me to remind you that you\\n     and you alone make the decision about whether or not you\\n     will or will not take the witness stand. My only question\\n     to you — I don’t need to know whether you’re going to take\\n     the witness stand or not. I know some judges require it,\\n     but I don’t. What I do need to know from you is if you have\\n     had an adequate opportunity to consult with Mr. Queen\\n     and Mr. Tailor about taking the witness stand? Yes or no.\\n     APPELLANT: Yes.\\n     TRIAL COURT: Yes. So you don’t need any more time to\\n     discuss that issue with them; is that correct?\\n     APPELLANT: No, Sir.\\n     TRIAL COURT: All right. Very well. State, are you\\n     satisfied with the admonition concerning the defendant’s\\n     right to testify or not testify in this case from the Court?\\n     THE STATE: Yes, Your Honor.\\n     TRIAL COURT: Defense?\\n     DEFENSE COUNSEL: Yes.\\n\\nShortly afterward, defense counsel requested permission to speak\\n\\nwith Appellant alone, which the trial court permitted. Defense\\n\\ncounsel then sought additional time to speak with Appellant’s\\n\\nmother, which the trial court also allowed. Afterward, the trial court\\n\\nbrought the jury back in, and the defense rested without Appellant\\n\\n\\n                                 12\\n testifying in his own defense.\\n\\n     “In Georgia, whether or not to testify in one’s own defense is\\n\\nconsidered a tactical decision to be made by the defendant himself\\n\\nafter consultation with his trial counsel and there is no general\\n\\nrequirement that a trial court interject itself into that decision-\\n\\nmaking process.” Burton v. State, 263 Ga. 725, 728 (438 SE2d 83)\\n\\n(1994). We have consistently rejected arguments like the one\\n\\nAppellant makes here. We have observed, for example, that “the\\n\\ntrial judge has no duty to advise a defendant of the right to testify\\n\\nor to ascertain on the record whether the defendant’s waiver of that\\n\\nright is voluntary, knowing, and intentional.” Id. (cleaned up).\\n\\nLikewise, we have noted that “mandat[ing] the trial court to engage\\n\\nin an on-the-record colloquy with a defendant to inquire of the non-\\n\\ntestifying defendant whether he desires to waive his right to testify”\\n\\nwas not required, although we observed that conducting such a\\n\\ncolloquy would be “the better practice.” Barron v. State, 264 Ga. 865,\\n\\n866 n.2 (452 SE2d 504) (1995). We have not retreated from that\\n\\nview. See, e.g., Williams v. State, 292 Ga. 844, 854 (742 SE2d 445)\\n\\n                                 13\\n (2013); Spencer v. State, 287 Ga. 434, 438-439 (696 SE2d 617) (2010);\\n\\nSanford v. State, 287 Ga. 351, 355 (695 SE2d 579) (2010); Gibson v.\\n\\nState, 283 Ga. 377, 380 (659 SE2d 372) (2008).\\n\\n      Appellant does not specifically argue that he was incompetent\\n\\nto stand trial, but merely refers to his impaired “mental condition.”\\n\\nNothing in the record at trial suggested that Appellant wanted to\\n\\ntestify or that he did not understand that he was giving up his right\\n\\nto do so. Appellant does not explain what inquiry the trial court was\\n\\nrequired to provide that it did not, and to the extent he does suggest\\n\\nadditional action, such action is not supported by our precedent. See,\\n\\ne.g., Spencer, 287 Ga. at 438-439. 3\\n\\n      4. Next, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing\\n\\nto instruct the jury on the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter\\n\\n\\n      3 Although Appellant cursorily suggests in a heading of his brief that his\\n\\ndecision to testify “was not knowingly and freely made,” Appellant failed to\\nsupport that contention with any legal argument or citation to authority. Thus,\\nto the extent that this is a different argument, it is abandoned. See Former\\nSupreme Court Rule 22 (2023) (providing that enumerations of error not\\nsupported by argument or citation to authority are abandoned). See also\\nEverett v. State, ___ Ga. ____, ____ n.4 (____ SE2d ___) (2024) (argument that\\nthe defendant “purported to enumerate as error” was abandoned under Former\\nRule 22 where the defendant “failed to support this particular assertion with\\nany argument or citation to legal authority”).\\n                                      14\\n and the principle of mutual combat.\\n\\n     Appellant asserts in his brief that the evidence indicated a\\n\\n“ferocious struggle” occurred before Parke’s death, pointing to\\n\\nevidence that blood was everywhere at the crime scene and that both\\n\\nhe and Parke sustained injuries. He argues that this struggle\\n\\nconstitutes serious provocation. OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) states:\\n\\n     A person commits the offense of voluntary manslaughter\\n     when he causes the death of another human being under\\n     circumstances which would otherwise be murder and if he\\n     acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and\\n     irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation\\n     sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person;\\n     however, if there should have been an interval between\\n     the provocation and the killing sufficient for the voice of\\n     reason and humanity to be heard, of which the jury in all\\n     cases shall be the judge, the killing shall be attributed to\\n     deliberate revenge and be punished as murder.\\n\\n“A trial court is required to grant the defendant’s request for a\\n\\ncharge on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter if\\n\\nthere is any evidence, however slight, to support such a charge.”\\n\\nWilkerson v. State, 317 Ga. 242, 247 (892 SE2d 737) (2023) (cleaned\\n\\nup). Whether slight evidence supports the charge is a question of\\n\\nlaw. See id. Evidence that a defendant and victim fought prior to a\\n\\n                                 15\\n homicide or that a victim resisted a defendant’s unlawful act is not\\n\\nthe type of serious provocation that the law recognizes as being\\n\\nsufficient to warrant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. See\\n\\nJohnson v. State, 313 Ga. 698, 700 (873 SE2d 123) (2022); Thompson\\n\\nv. State, 312 Ga. 254, 258 (862 SE2d 317) (2021).\\n\\n     Parke’s apparent struggle with Appellant prior to her death\\n\\ndoes not constitute serious provocation. See Funes v. State, 289 Ga.\\n\\n793, 795 (716 SE2d 183) (2011) (reiterating that evidence of a fight\\n\\nprior to a killing does not constitute serious provocation). Thus, the\\n\\ntrial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter.\\n\\n     Nor does evidence of a struggle warrant an instruction on\\n\\nmutual combat. “A finding that a defendant was engaged in mutual\\n\\ncombat at the time the victim was killed may authorize the jury to\\n\\nfind the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter[.]” Moore v.\\n\\nState, 307 Ga. 290, 295 (835 SE2d 610) (2019) (cleaned up). “Mutual\\n\\ncombat occurs when there is combat between two persons as a result\\n\\nof a sudden quarrel or such circumstances as indicate a purpose,\\n\\n                                 16\\n willingness, and intent on the part of both to engage mutually in a\\n\\nfight.” 4 Venturino v. State, 306 Ga. 391, 398 (830 SE2d 110) (2019)\\n\\n(cleaned up). “Evidence of an ordinary scuffle or fight typically does\\n\\nnot warrant a charge on mutual combat.” Russell v.

Because Appellant’s argument fails, we assume\\nwithout deciding that Appellant preserved this argument. Compare Marshall\\nv. State, 309 Ga. 698, 701-704 (848 SE2d 389) (2020) (holding that the\\ndefendant waived alleged sentencing error where the sentence was not void\\nand he “did not raise this claim in the trial court, either at the presentence\\nhearing or in his motion for new trial, and his trial counsel affirmatively\\nwaived any objection . . . by stating the defense had no argument to make”\\nabout the alleged sentencing error).\\n       .\\n                                        18\\n traumatic stress disorder, a language disorder, and other disorders,\\n\\nnoting that his brain resembled that of a teenager. Finally, Dr.\\n\\nPaganelli testified that Appellant’s symptoms could be managed\\n\\nthrough medication and treatment. At the close of the hearing before\\n\\nsentencing Appellant, the trial court told Appellant, “I’ve considered\\n\\nthe mitigation that you and your attorney have presented.”\\n\\n     OCGA § 16-5-1 (e) (1) provides, “A person convicted of the\\n\\noffense of murder shall be punished by death, by imprisonment for\\n\\nlife without parole, or by imprisonment for life.” “Although the\\n\\nlegislature defines crimes and sets the ranges of sentences, trial\\n\\ncourts generally have the discretion to fashion sentences that fit the\\n\\ncrimes [of] which the defendant is convicted, so long as the sentences\\n\\nfall within the statutory ranges.” State v. Riggs, 301 Ga. 63, 68 (799\\n\\nSE2d 770) (2017) (cleaned up). Moreover, if sentences that trial\\n\\ncourts impose fall within the statutory limits, appellate courts\\n\\ngenerally will not review them. See Monroe v.

IN THE MATTER OF JAMES W. DAVIS, III.\\n\\n\\n        PER CURIAM.\\n\\n        This disciplinary matter is before the Court on a Notice of\\n\\nDiscipline, recommending the disbarment of James W. Davis, III,1\\n\\n(State Bar No. 283824) for his role in intercepting a multi-million-\\n\\ndollar payment from an insurance company to its policy holder. As\\n\\nreflected in the record, Davis acknowledged service of the State\\n\\nBar’s Notice of Discipline for Disbarment (“Notice of Discipline”) on\\n\\nMarch 27, 2023, but failed to file a Notice of Rejection. Therefore,\\n\\nDavis is in default, has waived his right to an evidentiary hearing,\\n\\nand is subject to such discipline and further proceedings as may be\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 Davis was admitted to the State Bar in 1997 and was authorized to\\n\\npractice law at the time of the conduct at issue, but has since become an\\ninactive member of the State Bar.\\n determined by this Court. See Bar Rule 4-208.1 (b).2\\n\\n      The facts, as deemed admitted by Davis’s default,3 are as\\n\\nfollows.4   In December 2018, Coface North America Insurance\\n\\nCompany (the “Insurer”), a company specializing in commercial\\n\\ntrade credit insurance, agreed to pay one of its policyholders a claim-\\n\\nrelated payment in the amount of $3,093,085.50. On December 18,\\n\\n2018, the Insurer requested payment instructions from the\\n\\npolicyholder’s insurance broker and received payment instructions\\n\\nvia email from a policyholder representative, which included wire\\n\\ntransfer information for a bank account in the name of the\\n\\npolicyholder at Citibank, N.A. On December 19, 2018, an unknown\\n\\nindividual purporting to be the same policyholder representative\\n\\n\\n      2 This rule provides that, “[u]nless the Notice of Discipline is rejected by\\n\\nthe respondent as provided in Rule 4-208.3, (1) the respondent shall be in\\ndefault; (2) the respondent shall have no right to any evidentiary hearing; and\\n(3) the respondent shall be subject to such discipline and further proceedings\\nas may be determined by the Supreme Court of Georgia.”\\n       3 See In the Matter of Head, \\n317 Ga. 512\\n, 512 (\\n893 SE2d 706\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(noting that, because the respondent attorney failed to file a Notice of\\nRejection, the underlying facts were “deemed admitted by [his] default”).\\n       4 The record includes the State Bar’s Notice of Discipline, a\\n\\nmemorandum of grievance issued by the State Bar to Davis, and orders filed\\nin a lawsuit against Davis and others in the United States District Court for\\nthe Northern District of Georgia.\\n                                        2\\n sent an email to the Insurer, instructing the Insurer to disregard the\\n\\npayment instructions transmitted the previous day and to instead\\n\\nwire the funds to a bank account held by the policyholder’s attorney.\\n\\nAttached to the email was a letter of authorization and declaration\\n\\nthat included new wiring instructions to a Wells Fargo account in\\n\\nthe name of J. Davis – Attorney at Law, LLC IOLTA (“Davis’s\\n\\nIOLTA”). On December 21, 2018, the Insurer wired $3,093,085.50\\n\\nto Davis’s IOLTA account.\\n\\n     On December 31, 2018, the Insurer was informed that its\\n\\nemails with the policyholder had been compromised and that the\\n\\nfunds at issue were never received by the policyholder. The Insurer\\n\\nreported the incident to Citibank and the FBI, and on January 3,\\n\\n2019, counsel for the Insurer sent a “cease and desist” letter to Davis\\n\\ndemanding return of the funds.        The Insurer was subsequently\\n\\nnotified that Wells Fargo credited $2,540,319.30 from Davis’s\\n\\nIOLTA account to the Insurer, which left $552,755.20 unaccounted\\n\\nfor by Davis.    Additionally, the payment from Davis’s IOLTA\\n\\naccount to the Insurer included $3,500.00 belonging to clients of\\n\\n                                  3\\n Davis, of which Davis was aware.\\n\\n      Davis initially denied any knowledge of or participation in the\\n\\nmisappropriation of these funds and claimed that he was also a\\n\\nvictim in this scheme. However, the factual allegations of the Notice\\n\\nof Discipline—which Davis has admitted by virtue of his default—\\n\\nstate that Davis was “a knowing and intentional participant in the\\n\\ninterception and theft of the [funds]” and “knowingly used his\\n\\nattorney trust account to carry out the interception and theft of the\\n\\n[funds].”5\\n\\n      The State Disciplinary Board’s (the “Board”) memorandum of\\n\\ngrievance, which is also included in the record, demonstrates that\\n\\nthe Board initiated a grievance against Davis based upon\\n\\ninformation suggesting that Davis “may have violated one or more\\n\\nof the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct.” See Bar Rule 4-203\\n\\n(2). Specifically, the Board learned that, on January 14, 2019, the\\n\\nInsurer filed a lawsuit against Davis and numerous “John Does” in\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 The record does not reflect whether Davis was ever charged with any\\n\\ncrimes arising from this conduct.\\n                                     4\\n the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia\\n\\n(the “federal case”), raising claims for conversion, RICO, common\\n\\nlaw fraud, and civil conspiracy, among others.\\n\\n     On June 21, 2019, the district court issued an order in the\\n\\nfederal case addressing several motions filed by the parties,\\n\\nincluding Davis’s motion to dismiss and the Insurer’s motion for a\\n\\npreliminary injunction. The district court granted the Insurer’s\\n\\nrequest for injunctive relief and partly granted Davis’s motion to\\n\\ndismiss, but only as to certain of the Insurer’s claims. In so ruling,\\n\\nthe district court observed that, in litigating the federal case, Davis\\n\\nhad explicitly acknowledged and admitted to the following: (1) “in\\n\\nhis role as an attorney,” Davis “serves as a paymaster” for certain\\n\\nentities, and it was in this role as paymaster that he came to acquire\\n\\nthe funds at issue from the Insurer; (2) “[t]he first transfer of\\n\\n$3,093,085.50 was wired to Mr. Davis’s IOLTA [a]ccount on\\n\\nDecember 21, 2018”; (3) Davis was “informed by Citibank that the\\n\\ntransfer was the result of false wiring instructions”; (4) Wells Fargo\\n\\nreturned funds in the amount of $2,540,319.30 to the Insurer; (5)\\n\\n                                  5\\n “[f]unds in the amount of $552,766.20 were paid out to Mr. Davis as\\n\\nhis fee for services rendered as paymaster for what he believed was\\n\\na legitimate transaction” with the Insurer; (6) Davis “used his fee\\n\\nmonies to pay outstanding bills/debts”; and (7) Davis’s “involvement\\n\\nin the subject transaction was in his role as an attorney with the law\\n\\nfirm J. Davis, Attorney at Law, LLC.” The district court held that\\n\\nDavis’s “version of the facts” set forth above was “a binding judicial\\n\\nadmission.” The record reflects that the Insurer and Davis later\\n\\nsettled the federal case, and the case was administratively closed in\\n\\nOctober 2019.\\n\\n      Having reviewed the record and considered the facts deemed\\n\\nadmitted by Davis’s default, the State Disciplinary Board found\\n\\nprobable cause to believe that Davis violated Rules 1.15 (I), 1.15 (II)\\n\\n(a)6, and 8.4 (a) (4). The maximum sanction for a violation of Rules\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 Based on the underlying facts, it does not appear that Davis violated\\n\\nRule 1.15 (II) (a), which provides that\\n      [e]very lawyer who practices law in Georgia, whether said lawyer\\n      practices as a sole practitioner, or as a member of a firm,\\n      association, or professional corporation, and who receives money\\n      or property on behalf of a client or in any other fiduciary capacity,\\n\\n                                        6\\n 1.15 (I), 1.15 (II) (b), and 8.4 (a) (4) is disbarment.\\n\\n      As    aggravating      factors,    the   Board     considered      Davis’s\\n\\nsubstantial experience in the practice of law and, as a mitigating\\n\\nfactor, his absence of prior disciplinary history. The Board advised\\n\\nthat Standard 4.11 of the American Bar Association’s Annotated\\n\\nStandards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions was applicable to Davis’s\\n\\nviolations of Rules 1.15 (I) and 1.15 (II), which provides that\\n\\ndisbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly\\n\\nconverts client property and causes injury or potential injury to a\\n\\nclient. See ABA Standards for Imposing Sanction 4.11. See also In\\n\\nthe Matter of Morse, \\n266 Ga. 652\\n, 653 (\\n470 SE2d 232\\n) (1996) (stating\\n\\nthat this Court looks to the ABA Standards for guidance in\\n\\ndetermining      appropriate       disciplinary     sanction).     The    Board\\n\\n\\n\\n      shall maintain or have available one or more trust accounts as\\n      required by these Rules. All funds held by a lawyer for a client and\\n      all funds held by a lawyer in any other fiduciary capacity shall be\\n      deposited in and administered from a trust account.\\nMore likely, Davis violated Rule 1.15 (II) (b), which provides, in pertinent part,\\nthat “[n]o funds shall be withdrawn from such trust accounts for the personal\\nuse of the lawyer maintaining the account except earned lawyer’s fees debited\\nagainst the account of a specific client and recorded as such.” This discrepancy\\nultimately has no bearing on the recommended discipline in this case.\\n                                        7\\n concluded that Davis “knowingly converted the property of his\\n\\nclients when he included client funds from his trust account to make\\n\\npartial reimbursement of the funds at issue.”\\n\\n     The Board further advised that Standard 5.11 (b) of the ABA\\n\\nStandards for Imposing Sanctions was applicable to Davis’s\\n\\nviolation of Rule 8.4 (a) (4), which provides that disbarment is\\n\\ngenerally appropriate when a lawyer engages in intentional conduct\\n\\ninvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that\\n\\nseriously adversely reflects on the lawyer’s fitness to practice. See\\n\\nABA Standards for Imposing Sanction 5.11 (b). See also In the\\n\\nMatter of Morse, \\n266 Ga. at 653\\n. The Board concluded that\\n\\n“[t]hrough his knowing and intentional participation in the\\n\\ninterception and theft of the [funds at issue], [Davis] engaged in\\n\\nintentional   conduct   involving       dishonest,   fraud,   deceit,   or\\n\\nmisrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on [Davis’s]\\n\\nfitness to practice.”\\n\\n     Having reviewed the record and considered Davis’s factual\\n\\nadmissions herein, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate\\n\\n                                    8\\n sanction in this disciplinary matter and is consistent with similar\\n\\ncases in which an attorney utilized fraud to misappropriate funds\\n\\nand defaulted during the disciplinary process.        See, e.g., In the\\n\\nMatter of Fagan, \\n314 Ga. 208\\n, 213 (\\n876 SE2d 242\\n) (2022) (disbarring\\n\\nattorney who engaged in professional misconduct involving\\n\\ndishonesty and fraud, misappropriated client funds, and failed to\\n\\nrespond to the formal complaint); In the Matter of Cheatham, \\n304\\n\\nGa. 645\\n, 646 (\\n820 SE2d 668\\n) (2018) (disbarring attorney who\\n\\nconverted client funds to his own use and failed to respond to\\n\\ndisciplinary authorities); In the Matter of Mathis, \\n297 Ga. 867\\n, 868\\n\\n(\\n778 SE2d 793\\n) (2015) (disbarring attorney who misappropriated\\n\\nclient funds that had been wired to him in advance of a real estate\\n\\nclosing   and   failed   to   respond   to   disciplinary   authorities).\\n\\nAccordingly, it is hereby ordered that the name of James W. Davis,\\n\\nIII be removed from the rolls of persons authorized to practice law\\n\\nin the State of Georgia. Davis is reminded of his duties pursuant to\\n\\nBar Rule 4-219 (b).\\n\\n     Disbarred.

PLATT v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n        Rodrigues Platt 1 appeals his convictions related to the shooting\\n\\ndeath of David Jones, Jr. 2 On appeal, Platt argues that the trial\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 Platt’s first name is spelled “Rodriguez” in some court filings and in his\\n\\nbrief, but most of the court filings below use “Rodrigues.”\\n       2 The crimes occurred on June 16, 2009. In February 2010, a Liberty\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Platt, Jedediah Duncan, and Steven Bond for\\nmalice murder, felony murder predicated on aggravated assault, aggravated\\nassault, armed robbery, burglary, and possession of a firearm during the\\ncommission of a crime. The court severed the co-defendants’ trials, and the\\nrecord does not show the status of those cases. A jury found Platt guilty on all\\ncounts at an August 2011 trial, and the trial court sentenced him to life in\\nprison for malice murder, two concurrent twenty-year terms for armed robbery\\nand burglary, and a consecutive five-year term for the firearms offense. The\\nother counts were merged or vacated by operation of law. Platt filed a motion\\nfor new trial in August 2011 and amended it in 2019. The trial court denied\\nthe motion in September 2023. Platt timely filed a notice of appeal, and the\\ncase was docketed to this Court’s term beginning in December 2023 and\\nsubmitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n       The record does not reveal why it took well over a decade to resolve\\nPlatt’s motion for new trial. Platt asserts no claim about the post-conviction\\ndelay, but we nevertheless remind trial courts and attorneys of their duty\\ndiligently and efficiently to resolve pending motions for new trial.\\n court should have granted a mistrial due to the State’s failure to\\n\\ndisclose the inconclusive test results of a hair sample from a critical\\n\\nwitness against him who was also a possible suspect in the timely\\n\\nmanner required by OCGA § 17-6-4 and Brady v. Maryland, \\n373\\n\\nU.S. 83\\n (83 SCt 1194, 10LE2d 215) (1963). He also argues that the\\n\\ncourt should have granted a mistrial based on the State’s belated\\n\\ndisclosure that Platt’s initial custodial interview had been recorded\\n\\ndespite previously representing otherwise. Platt also argues that the\\n\\ntrial court should have taken some curative action when the\\n\\nprosecutor improperly identified him for testifying witnesses, and\\n\\nthat the cumulative prejudice of these errors warrants a new trial.\\n\\nWe conclude that Platt has failed to establish that a mistrial was\\n\\nnecessary to preserve his right to a fair trial, that any curative\\n\\naction was necessary based on the prosecutor’s identification of him,\\n\\nor that any errors cumulatively prejudiced him. Therefore, we\\n\\naffirm.\\n\\n      The evidence at trial showed the following. Jones lived in the\\n\\nTapco Mobile Home Park in Liberty County. He sold drugs and kept\\n\\n                                  2\\n his money in a small, black travel safe. On June 16, 2009, Jones was\\n\\nshot multiple times in his mobile home, leading to his death. Jarius\\n\\nWilson lived in a mobile home close to the victim’s and heard a noise\\n\\non the day of the shooting that sounded like firecrackers. After he\\n\\nheard the sound, Wilson looked out his window and saw “some guys”\\n\\nwearing masks running from the victim’s home and toward a\\n\\n“grayish-greenish” SUV.\\n\\n     Monique Hendry, Platt’s sister, testified that on the day of\\n\\nJones’s death, Platt, Steven Bond, and Jedediah Duncan were at\\n\\nHendry’s mother’s house. Bond and Duncan were wearing\\n\\ncamouflage, had gas masks, and were playing with a black gun. The\\n\\nthree men left in a “goldish” SUV driven by Duncan.\\n\\n     Miriam Brown testified that on the day of the shooting, Duncan\\n\\npicked her up and drove her to Hinesville, driving a tan or gold SUV.\\n\\nBond was also in the vehicle, and the two men were wearing army\\n\\nfatigues, jeans, and black shirts. On the drive to Hinesville, Bond\\n\\nand Duncan showed her a gas mask and a bulletproof vest, and\\n\\nDuncan passed a black gun to Bond. Duncan and Bond dropped off\\n\\n                                 3\\n Brown. When they picked her up later that day, she heard one of\\n\\nthem say, “I can’t believe it,” that they had killed someone, and that\\n\\nthey had shot “him” three times because “he had seen his face.”\\n\\nDuncan and Bond said that they had gone to the victim’s house to\\n\\n“kick in the door” and that they took a safe that was full of “eight\\n\\nballs,” which Brown said meant crack cocaine.\\n\\n     Bruce Coleman testified that he was at Tapco on the morning\\n\\nof the shooting and went to the store with Duncan and Bond in\\n\\nDuncan’s gold SUV. Before dropping Coleman off at the Pineland\\n\\nApartment complex where Coleman’s girlfriend lived, Duncan and\\n\\nBond talked about “a lick,” which Coleman described as a robbery,\\n\\nand Coleman declined their invitation to join them. Later that day,\\n\\nColeman saw Duncan drop off Platt and Bond at Pineland. Bond\\n\\nsaid they had robbed and shot someone, possibly killing the victim.\\n\\nColeman did not believe Bond, so he went to ask Platt, who had\\n\\nwalked away. Platt said that “they” probably had killed “him” and\\n\\nshowed Coleman a gun that Platt said was used during the robbery.\\n\\n     Steve Plair, Bond’s older brother who also lived at Tapco at the\\n\\n                                  4\\n time of the shooting, said that on the morning of the shooting,\\n\\nDuncan and Bond were outside the mobile home discussing robbing\\n\\nsomeone. Plair said that Platt, Bond, and Duncan were at his mobile\\n\\nhome later that night, and Platt had a revolver. Plair testified that\\n\\nthe three men left, and 35 to 45 minutes later, Plair heard gunshots.\\n\\nPlair saw Platt a few days later, and Platt admitted to shooting\\n\\nsomeone called “Little Dave.” Platt said that when he was in the\\n\\nvictim’s mobile home, Platt’s face covering slipped, so he guessed the\\n\\nvictim saw him. Platt said he shot the victim three times, while\\n\\nDuncan retrieved the safe. Plair admitted that on the night of the\\n\\nshooting, he hid from police but later turned himself in. Plair was\\n\\narrested because someone identified him as being involved in the\\n\\nshooting, but he denied being involved and said he knew nothing.\\n\\nPlair later told police about Platt’s statements, admitting that he\\n\\ndid so only after being charged with murder in this case — charges\\n\\nthat were ultimately dismissed.\\n\\n     During the investigation, Duncan led police to a field where\\n\\nthey found, among other things, a stocking cap that had hairs inside,\\n\\n                                  5\\n a camouflage shirt and pants, a gas mask, and a safe that had “3A2”\\n\\nwritten on it. The same inscription — “3A2” — was also written on\\n\\na key found in the victim’s pocket. Police also found one 9mm shell\\n\\ncasing at the bottom of the steps to the victim’s mobile home and\\n\\nanother in Duncan’s vehicle, and a firearms expert testified that\\n\\nthey were fired from the same weapon.\\n\\n     Platt was interviewed by police on two different days. During\\n\\nthe second interview, which was recorded and played for the jury at\\n\\ntrial, Platt admitted participating in the armed robbery and that\\n\\nJones was shot during the crime. He denied shooting Jones. Platt,\\n\\nDuncan, and Bond were charged with several crimes, and following\\n\\na jury trial, Platt was convicted of malice murder, armed robbery,\\n\\nburglary, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\n\\ncrime.\\n\\n     1.   Platt argues that the trial court should have granted a\\n\\nmistrial based on the State’s untimely disclosure that it had\\n\\ncompared the hairs found in the recovered stocking cap against\\n\\nPlair’s hair and found the results inconclusive. We disagree.\\n\\n                                 6\\n      Platt filed a pretrial discovery motion, requesting, among other\\n\\nthings, the results of all scientific tests and all Brady material. Two\\n\\nweeks before trial, defense counsel met with the prosecutor, the lead\\n\\ninvestigator Detective Snider, and other police officers, to review\\n\\nevery exhibit the State intended to introduce at trial. The State did\\n\\nnot at that time disclose to Platt that it had tested Plair’s hair with\\n\\ninconclusive results.\\n\\n     During opening statements, Platt’s counsel told the jury that,\\n\\nalthough the State had compared the hair recovered from the\\n\\nstocking cap to the defendants in the case and did not find a match,\\n\\nthe State never compared those hairs to hair samples from Plair. In\\n\\nfact, that was not true: unbeknownst to trial counsel, the State had\\n\\nmade that comparison, although the results were inconclusive. After\\n\\nopening statements and during a recess, the State disclosed to Platt\\n\\nfor the first time that it had tested Plair’s hair with inconclusive\\n\\nresults. Platt moved for a mistrial and called Detective Snider in\\n\\nsupport of that motion. Detective Snider testified that a few weeks\\n\\nbefore trial, he talked to the GBI agent who conducted the test on\\n\\n                                  7\\n Plair’s hair, and was told that the initial comparison was\\n\\n“tentatively” inconclusive, the agent would prepare a final report\\n\\nafter peer review, and the agent would submit samples for DNA\\n\\ntesting, which Detective Snider understood to mean that the agent\\n\\nhad only looked at the hair samples under a microscope. Detective\\n\\nSnider confirmed that, although testing results for Platt and other\\n\\ndefendants were provided to Platt as part of discovery, no\\n\\ninformation about the testing of Plair’s hair was provided. Detective\\n\\nSnider said he had not talked to the GBI agent since being informed\\n\\nof the inconclusive results.\\n\\n     The court denied the mistrial motion, concluding that the\\n\\nresults did not “help or hurt either side.” The court allowed Platt’s\\n\\ncounsel to reopen opening statements. Counsel told the jury that he\\n\\nmade a misstatement about Plair’s hair never having been tested\\n\\nand this was caused by the State’s failure to disclose this\\n\\ninformation. Counsel insisted that the State was “hiding evidence,”\\n\\nthat he had been subjected to “trial by ambush,” that he had been\\n\\nunable to prepare the defense adequately or conduct independent\\n\\n                                 8\\n testing of the hair given the last-minute disclosure, and that this\\n\\nwas “all the reasonable doubt” the jury needed.\\n\\n     On appeal, Platt argues that the untimely disclosure impaired\\n\\nhis defense and that a mistrial was therefore warranted. A trial\\n\\ncourt is vested with broad discretion as to whether to grant a\\n\\nmistrial, and a court’s decision not to grant one will not be disturbed\\n\\non appeal unless there is a showing that a mistrial was essential to\\n\\npreserve a party’s right to a fair trial. See Jordan v. State, \\n305 Ga.\\n\\n12\\n, 15 (2) (\\n823 SE2d 336\\n) (2019); Ragan v. State, \\n299 Ga. 828\\n, 833-\\n\\n834 (3) (\\n792 SE2d 342\\n) (2016).\\n\\n     Platt argues primarily that a mistrial was necessary to remedy\\n\\nthe State’s violation of Brady. Under Brady,\\n\\n     the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable\\n     to an accused upon request violates due process where the\\n     evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,\\n     irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\\n     prosecution. This includes the suppression of\\n     impeachment evidence that may be used to challenge the\\n     credibility of a witness.\\n\\nHood v. State, \\n311 Ga. 855\\n, 863 (1) (\\n860 SE2d 432\\n) (2021) (citations\\n\\nand punctuation omitted); see also Chavez v. State, \\n307 Ga. 804\\n, 813\\n\\n                                  9\\n (3) (\\n837 SE2d 766\\n) (2020) (to be entitled to a new trial, a defendant\\n\\nmust show that the evidence is “material to his guilt or punishment”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)). Evidence is “material” in this\\n\\ncontext when “there is a reasonable probability that, had the\\n\\nevidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have\\n\\nbeen different. A ‘reasonable probability’ of a different result is one\\n\\nin which the suppressed evidence undermines confidence in the\\n\\noutcome of the trial.” Chavez, 307 Ga. at 813 (3) (citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). “In the case of an untimely disclosure, a\\n\\ndefendant must show that an earlier disclosure would have\\n\\nbenefited the defense and that the delayed disclosure deprived him\\n\\nof a fair trial.” Anglin v. State, \\n312 Ga. 503\\n, 510 (2) (b) (\\n863 SE2d\\n\\n148\\n) (2021) (citation and punctuation omitted). Platt has failed to\\n\\nmake this showing.\\n\\n     Platt first argues that the untimely disclosure affected his\\n\\nopening statement, and that the entire defense, as reflected by the\\n\\nopening statement, became “unsupported” by the late disclosure.\\n\\nAlthough the untimely disclosure undermined his statement about\\n\\n                                  10\\n a lack of testing, Platt was able to argue to the jury that the State\\n\\nwas “hiding evidence,” creating doubt as to the thoroughness of the\\n\\nState’s investigation.\\n\\n     Platt also argues that the untimely disclosure hampered his\\n\\ndefense, but he does not show how he would have altered his defense\\n\\nif given the information sooner. Platt claims that he could have\\n\\nprocured independent DNA testing of the hair had he been made\\n\\naware of the inconclusive results sooner, and that he could have used\\n\\nthis information to impeach Plair and establish his motive for saying\\n\\nthat Platt confessed to him that Platt shot Jones. Platt’s arguments\\n\\nare meritless. Platt knew about the hair recovered from the stocking\\n\\ncap. Although he thought the hair had not been compared to Plair’s\\n\\nhair, as reflected by his initial opening statement, there is no\\n\\nevidence in the record that he ever sought to secure independent\\n\\nDNA testing of the recovered hair prior to trial. And Platt’s claim\\n\\nabout what the DNA testing would reveal is purely speculative, as\\n\\nthere is no evidence of such testing. Platt argues in his appellate\\n\\nbrief that “[i]t could have been [Plair’s] hair in the stocking cap[,]”\\n\\n                                  11\\n but further testing could have alternatively revealed that the hair\\n\\nbelonged to Platt. In any case, whatever the results of DNA testing\\n\\nwould have revealed, Platt has not shown that any further\\n\\nimpeachment of Plair would have made a meaningful difference.\\n\\nMoreover, Platt was able to impeach Plair about his motive for\\n\\nsaying that Platt confessed to the crime, suggesting that Plair\\n\\nnamed Platt only after Plair himself was charged in the case. See\\n\\nHood v. State, \\n311 Ga. 855\\n, 864-865 (1) (\\n860 SE2d 432\\n) (2021)\\n\\n(although full scope of witness’s “possible incentives to cooperate\\n\\nwith the State was not made known to the jury, the jury was\\n\\nnonetheless aware there was reason to regard his testimony with\\n\\nskepticism[,]” and witness’s testimony was largely cumulative of\\n\\nother evidence, so defendant was unable to establish materiality).\\n\\nBecause Platt has shown only a mere possibility that additional\\n\\ntesting would have been favorable to his defense, he has failed to\\n\\nshow a Brady violation. See Mitchell v. State, \\n307 Ga. 855\\n, 862 (2)\\n\\n(b) (\\n838 SE2d 847\\n) (2020) (rejecting Brady claim as not establishing\\n\\nmateriality because defendant offered no evidence in support of his\\n\\n                                12\\n speculation that had he been provided with information about\\n\\nfingerprints lifted from a taxi where the victim was found dead, he\\n\\ncould have procured independent testing that would have helped his\\n\\ndefense).\\n\\n     Platt also argues that the State’s failure to disclose the\\n\\ninconclusive results violated statutory disclosure rules. Specifically,\\n\\nPlatt argues that the State violated OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (4) by failing\\n\\nto reduce to writing the GBI agent’s oral report and failing to provide\\n\\nhim with a copy of the same. By its terms, however, the statute\\n\\nimposes a duty on the State to provide the results of scientific\\n\\ntesting, including if a report is “oral or partially oral,” only “if the\\n\\nstate intends to introduce [the results of the testing] in evidence in\\n\\nits case-in-chief or in rebuttal[.]” See OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (4). 3 There\\n\\n\\n     3 The subparagraph provides:\\n\\n\\n\\n     The prosecuting attorney shall, no later than ten days prior to\\n     trial, or as otherwise ordered by the court, permit the defendant at\\n     a time agreed to by the parties or ordered by the court to inspect\\n     and copy or photograph a report of any physical or mental\\n     examinations and of scientific tests or experiments, including a\\n     summary of the basis for the expert opinion rendered in the report,\\n     or copies thereof, if the state intends to introduce in evidence in its\\n\\n                                       13\\n was no indication that the State intended to introduce into evidence\\n\\nthe “inconclusive results” of the testing of Plair’s hair, so Platt has\\n\\nfailed to demonstrate a violation of OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (4). Because\\n\\nthe untimely disclosure did not violate Brady or OCGA § 17-16-4 (a)\\n\\n(4), Platt’s claim that the trial court erred in failing to remedy such\\n\\nviolations necessarily fails.\\n\\n     2.    Platt argues that the trial court should have also granted\\n\\na mistrial, or at least a continuance, due to the State’s untimely\\n\\ndisclosure that Platt’s first custodial interview had been recorded\\n\\nwhen it had previously represented otherwise. We disagree.\\n\\n     At a Jackson-Denno 4 hearing before trial, the investigator who\\n\\nhad interviewed Platt, Detective Howard, testified that he\\n\\n\\n\\n     case-in-chief or in rebuttal the results of the physical or mental\\n     examination or scientific test or experiment. If the report is oral or\\n     partially oral, the prosecuting attorney shall reduce all relevant\\n     and material oral portions of such report to writing and shall serve\\n     opposing counsel with such portions no later than ten days prior to\\n     trial. Nothing in this Code section shall require the disclosure of\\n     any other material, note, or memorandum relating to the\\n     psychiatric or psychological treatment or therapy of any victim or\\n     witness.\\n\\nOCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (4) (emphasis added).\\n    4 Jackson v. Denno, \\n378 U.S. 368\\n (84 SCt 1774, 12 LE2d 908) (1964).\\n\\n                                      14\\n interviewed Platt on two different days, the second interview a full\\n\\nday after the first. Detective Howard testified that although he\\n\\nproposed recording the first interview, he did not actually do so. He\\n\\ntestified that the second interview was recorded and that Platt’s\\n\\nstatements during the first interview were consistent with those\\n\\ngiven at the second interview.\\n\\n     Apparently based on this testimony, Platt argued during\\n\\nopening statements that the jury was not going to hear what\\n\\nhappened during the first interview because it was not recorded; the\\n\\njury would hear only what a police officer says happened; and the\\n\\njury would hear only Platt’s statements that were recorded after he\\n\\nhad spent a night in a jail where the victim’s father worked, which\\n\\nwould have instilled fear into Platt.\\n\\n     During the lunch break on the second day of the trial, the State\\n\\ninformed defense counsel that Platt’s first interview had, in fact,\\n\\nbeen recorded. Defense counsel listened to the recording once over\\n\\nthe lunch break and asked for a mistrial because the “new evidence\\n\\n. . . contradicts a good bit of what I’ve been saying and the way I’ve\\n\\n                                  15\\n tailored the defense in this — you know, during this trial for the past\\n\\nday and a half.” Defense counsel alternatively asked for a\\n\\ncontinuance “at least for the rest of the day” to allow counsel to\\n\\nreview the recording more thoroughly and incorporate the evidence\\n\\ninto Platt’s defense.\\n\\n     The prosecutor stated that she did not know about the\\n\\nrecording until the second day of trial when Detective Howard\\n\\nmentioned it during a conversation; the prosecutor said she\\n\\nimmediately let defense counsel know and suggested as a remedy\\n\\nthat the recording not be played. Defense counsel noted in response\\n\\nthat Platt’s statements were not the same during the two interviews,\\n\\nas he did not inculpate himself in the first interview. Defense\\n\\ncounsel later observed that this was the second piece of evidence\\n\\nthat was not timely disclosed. In response, the prosecutor said she\\n\\ndid not want to “start all over again. But if the Court feels that’s the\\n\\nthing to do out of fairness, the State’s really not . . . .” The trial court\\n\\ndenied the motion before the prosecutor finished her statement.\\n\\n     Responding to the continuance request, the prosecutor did not\\n\\n                                    16\\n object to giving defense counsel the rest of the day to review the\\n\\nrecording, but preferred to break for just three hours because the\\n\\nprosecutor had planned to call a witness who was travelling that day\\n\\nand wanted to get her “in and out.” The court asked if the jury\\n\\nshould hear “the truth about all this,” and defense counsel said, “we\\n\\nhave to . . . I don’t see how we can’t tell them, you know, that there’s\\n\\ntwo pieces of evidence.” After confirming that counsel had listened\\n\\nto the recording, the trial court denied a continuance.\\n\\n     The recordings of both interviews were ultimately played for\\n\\nthe jury during Detective Howard’s testimony. As captured in the\\n\\nrecording of the first interview, Platt admitted to being in Tapco\\n\\nduring the robbery and seeing parts of it from a nearby mobile home,\\n\\nbut he denied being involved or knowing who shot Jones. During\\n\\ncross-examination, Platt elicited testimony that Detective Howard\\n\\nhad previously testified at the Jackson-Denno hearing that Platt\\n\\nnever denied being involved in the robbery.\\n\\n     Platt argues on appeal that the State’s failure to advise him\\n\\nthat his first interview was recorded and provide him a copy of that\\n\\n                                  17\\n recording violated OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (1), and that a mistrial was\\n\\nwarranted under the remedies available under OCGA § 17-16-6\\n\\nbecause he showed that the State acted in bad faith and he was\\n\\nprejudiced as a result. For its part, the State does not dispute that\\n\\nit violated OCGA § 17-16-4 (a) (1) by failing to advise Platt that the\\n\\nfirst interview was recorded and allow him to inspect or copy it in\\n\\nadvance of trial. Instead, the State argues that the trial court’s\\n\\nremedial actions were adequate under OCGA § 17-16-6.\\n\\n     As stated above, a trial court has broad discretion to grant or\\n\\ndeny a mistrial. This discretion also applies to whether to grant a\\n\\nmistrial as a remedy under OCGA § 17-16-6. See Tubbs v. State, \\n276\\n\\nGa. 751\\n, 753-754 (3) (\\n583 SE2d 853\\n) (2003). A court also has the\\n\\ndiscretion to grant a continuance as a remedy for a violation of\\n\\nOCGA § 17-16-6. Id. at 753-753 (2), (3). As explained above, we will\\n\\nnot overturn a trial court’s decision to deny a mistrial unless a\\n\\nmistrial was essential to preserve the right to a fair trial. And to\\n\\nobtain a new trial from the improper denial of a continuance request,\\n\\na defendant must show harm. See Harris v. State, \\n309 Ga. 599\\n, 609\\n\\n                                 18\\n (3) (\\n847 SE2d 563\\n) (2020). Platt has failed to make these showings.\\n\\n     (i)      A mistrial was not essential to preserve Platt’s right to\\n     a fair trial.\\n\\n     Platt argues that he was prejudiced by the late disclosure\\n\\nbecause he had referenced the fact that the first interview was not\\n\\nrecorded in his opening statement. But Platt does not show how the\\n\\nlate disclosure harmed him.\\n\\n     He first argues that he was prejudiced because he referred to\\n\\nthe first interview in his opening statement and it formed the basis\\n\\nof his defense. But he referred to that interview to suggest that he\\n\\ndid not initially admit participating in the crime and made his\\n\\nadmission during the second interview only as a result of fear after\\n\\nspending a night in jail. The recording of that first interview only\\n\\nbolstered this argument. In that recording, Platt admits to being in\\n\\nTapco during the robbery and knowing about it, but he denied being\\n\\ninvolved or knowing who shot Jones. The recording thus supported,\\n\\nrather than undermined, Platt’s opening statement where he\\n\\nsuggested that his confession in the second interview was not\\n\\n\\n                                  19\\n truthful.\\n\\n      Platt next argues that he was prejudiced because Detective\\n\\nHoward testified at the motions hearing that Platt’s statements in\\n\\nthe two interviews were consistent. But Platt was able to use the\\n\\nrecording to impeach Detective Howard’s credibility by showing that\\n\\nDetective Howard’s prior testimony was not accurate, and he has\\n\\nnot shown how an earlier disclosure would have made any difference\\n\\nin this respect.\\n\\n      Platt also argues that he was prejudiced by the untimely\\n\\ndisclosure because he had to question three of the State’s most\\n\\nimportant witnesses without a “correct” version of events as relayed\\n\\nin the first interview. But this claim is vague and unsupported. Platt\\n\\ndoes not identify which witnesses he considers to be “most\\n\\nimportant.” But more importantly, he does he show how he would\\n\\nhave examined these witnesses differently had the recording been\\n\\ndisclosed sooner.5\\n\\n\\n      5 In one part of his brief, Platt notes that the State called five witnesses\\n\\nafter lunch (after he listened to the recording), lists four witnesses (“Detective\\n\\n                                       20\\n       Platt contends that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s\\n\\nfailure to “remedy the situation with the jury” despite having\\n\\n“promised” to do so.6 In support of this argument, Platt relies on Lee\\n\\nv. State, \\n306 Ga. 663\\n (\\n832 SE2d 851\\n) (2019), where this Court stated\\n\\nthat a trial court acts within its discretion to deny a motion for\\n\\nmistrial “when it provides adequate curative instructions to the jury\\n\\nto cure any prejudice stemming from the introduction of the\\n\\nimproper evidence.” Id. at 669. But as already made clear, Platt has\\n\\ndemonstrated no prejudice resulting from the late disclosure of the\\n\\nrecording; instead, the recording seemed to help his defense and he\\n\\nhas not shown any harm from the delayed disclosure.\\n\\n      Platt next relies on the State’s apparent lack of opposition to a\\n\\nmistrial as evidence that the trial court should have granted one.\\n\\n\\n\\nSnider, a GBI crime lab tools examiner, Plair, and Detective Howard”), and\\nthen states “the newly-disclosed recording impacted all three.” Even assuming\\nPlatt was referring to Detective Snider, Detective Howard, and Plair as the\\n“three most important” witnesses, he does not explain what line of questioning\\nhe would have pursued had he known about the recording sooner. And as\\ndiscussed, he was able to use the recording to impeach Detective Howard.\\n       6 In his brief, Platt cites the trial court’s question about whether it should\\n\\ntell the jury the “truth” about the recording, but there is nothing in this\\nexchange to show that it promised some sort of curative instruction.\\n                                         21\\n Platt seems to focus on the prosecutor’s response to whether it\\n\\nrequested the court deny the motion for mistrial. The prosecutor did\\n\\nnot finish her sentence before the trial court denied the motion, so it\\n\\nis not entirely clear what position the prosecutor was taking. But\\n\\neven if the prosecutor’s statement is read as an apparent lack of\\n\\nobjection, this does not establish that a mistrial was necessary. At\\n\\nmost, the prosecutor’s statements show her acknowledgement of the\\n\\nfact that the court could grant a mistrial; those statements fell short\\n\\nof showing that the court was required to grant one. See Hightower\\n\\nv. State, \\n315 Ga. 399\\n, 404 (2) (\\n883 SE2d 335\\n) (2023) (simply because\\n\\n“reasonable” minds may differ about whether other alternatives are\\n\\nproper is not dispositive of whether a trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nin deciding whether to grant a mistrial). We conclude that Platt has\\n\\nfailed to show that a mistrial was necessary to preserve his right to\\n\\na fair trial.\\n\\n      (ii)    Even if the court abused its discretion in denying Platt\\n      a continuance, he has not shown harm to warrant a new trial.\\n\\n      Platt alternatively argues that the trial court should have at\\n\\n\\n                                  22\\n least granted his unopposed request for a continuance. But even if\\n\\nthe trial court abused its discretion in denying that request, Platt\\n\\ncannot obtain a new trial unless he shows harm. See Harris v. State,\\n\\n309 Ga. 599\\n, 609 (3) (\\n847 SE2d 563\\n) (2020). Platt argues that he\\n\\nneeded more time to study the recording and prepare, but he makes\\n\\nno showing how additional time would have benefitted him. See\\n\\nPhoenix v. State, \\n304 Ga. 785\\n, 789 (2) (\\n822 SE2d 195\\n) (2018) (“To\\n\\nshow harm, a party is required to specifically identify what other\\n\\nevidence or witnesses he would have put forth in his defense if his\\n\\ncounsel had been given more time to prepare; speculation and\\n\\nconjecture are not enough.” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\nMoreover, as discussed above, Platt demonstrated no prejudice from\\n\\nthe untimely disclosure of the recording, as the recording seemed to\\n\\nhelp, rather than harm, Platt’s defense. Because Platt has failed to\\n\\nshow how any additional time to prepare harmed him, this\\n\\nargument fails. 7\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 Although the claims of untimely disclosure do not warrant reversal, we\\n\\ndo not condone the State’s failure to comply with its legal obligations.\\n                                       23\\n      3.   Platt argues that the prosecutor violated OCGA § 17-8-75\\n\\nby “identifying” him for three witnesses, and the trial court erred by\\n\\nfailing to take some curative action. From a review of the record, it\\n\\nappears that the witnesses had an obstructed view of the defense\\n\\ntable where Platt was sitting, and the prosecutor attempted to point\\n\\nout Platt’s location in the courtroom. The prosecutor did nothing\\n\\nmore than say where Platt was located.\\n\\n     OCGA § 17-8-75 provides:\\n\\n     Where counsel in the hearing of the jury make statements\\n     of prejudicial matters which are not in evidence, it is the\\n     duty of the court to interpose and prevent the same. On\\n     objection made, the court shall also rebuke the counsel\\n     and by all needful and proper instructions to the jury\\n     endeavor to remove the improper impression from their\\n     minds; or, in his discretion, he may order a mistrial if the\\n     prosecuting attorney is the offender.\\n\\n     We are dubious that the prosecutor’s actions were “statements\\n\\nof prejudicial matters” triggering a requirement for the trial court to\\n\\ntake curative action under OCGA § 17-8-75. The jury was no doubt\\n\\nwell aware that Platt was on trial and was sitting at the defense\\n\\ntable. There is no indication that the prosecutor did anything more\\n\\n\\n                                  24\\n than to make sure witnesses knew where Platt was.\\n\\n     But even if this amounted to a violation of OCGA § 17-8-75,\\n\\nany error in failing to prevent the prosecutor from making continued\\n\\n“identifications” of Platt or issuing a curative instruction was\\n\\nharmless.\\n\\n     [A] trial court’s error in not fulfilling its duty under OCGA\\n     § 17-8-75 is subject to harmless error analysis. For\\n     nonconstitutional harmless error, the State has the\\n     burden to show that it was highly probable that the error\\n     did not contribute to the verdict.\\n\\nCaldwell v. State, \\n313 Ga. 640\\n, 648 (2) (\\n872 SE2d 712\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, any error was harmless given the strong evidence of\\n\\nPlatt’s guilt. Even setting aside Platt’s second recorded interview in\\n\\nwhich he admitted participating in the armed robbery, other\\n\\nevidence showed that Platt shot Jones or, at the very least,\\n\\nparticipated in the armed robbery. Plair testified that Platt said he\\n\\nshot the victim during a robbery when Platt’s face covering fell off\\n\\nand allowed him to see Platt. Bruce Coleman also heard Duncan and\\n\\nBond talk on the day of the shooting about a planning a “lick,” or\\n\\n                                  25\\n robbery, and when he saw them afterward, he heard from Platt and\\n\\nBond that they carried out the robbery and “probably” killed\\n\\nsomeone. Miriam Brown and Platt’s sister testified that on the day\\n\\nof the shooting, Platt, Duncan, Bond, and Plair were playing with a\\n\\ngun and wearing clothing that was later recovered from the same\\n\\nfield where a safe appearing to belong to the victim was also found.\\n\\nGiven the strength of the evidence, and the jury’s awareness that\\n\\nPlatt was on trial and was sitting at the defense table, it is highly\\n\\nprobable that the prosecutor’s actions in pointing out Platt as the\\n\\ndefendant to witnesses did not contribute to the jury’s verdict.\\n\\n     4.   Platt next argues that the cumulative prejudice from the\\n\\ntrial court’s errors warranted a new trial. We disagree.\\n\\n     To establish cumulative error, Platt must establish that “at\\n\\nleast two errors were committed in the course of the trial and\\n\\nconsidered together along with the entire record, the multiple errors\\n\\nso infected the jury’s deliberation that they denied [him] a\\n\\nfundamentally fair trial.” Huff v. State, \\n315 Ga. 558\\n, 567-568 (6) (\\n883\\n\\nSE2d 773\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). Above, we\\n\\n                                  26\\n assume, without deciding, that the trial court may have erred in\\n\\nfailing to grant Platt a continuance related to the State’s untimely\\n\\ndisclosure that Platt’s first custodial interview had been recorded\\n\\nand in failing to take some curative action with respect to the\\n\\nprosecutor’s identification of Platt to witnesses. As explained above,\\n\\nthese errors produced very little, if any, harm. Therefore, given the\\n\\nstrength of the evidence, even if these assumed errors could be\\n\\nconsidered cumulatively, the cumulative prejudice did not deny\\n\\nPlatt a fair trial.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 27\\n '),\n",

SCONYERS v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        ELLINGTON, Justice.\\n\\n        Charles Michael Sconyers appeals his convictions for malice\\n\\nmurder and cruelty to children in the first degree in connection with\\n\\nthe death of Chelsea Finch’s 23-month-old son, Lincoln Davitte,\\n\\nfrom blunt-force trauma to his skull. 1 The State presented evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n        1 The crimes occurred on May 1, 2019. On November 5, 2020, a Columbia\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Sconyers for malice murder, two counts of felony\\nmurder, and one count each of aggravated assault and cruelty to children in\\nthe first degree. After a jury trial that ended on May 13, 2022, Sconyers was\\nfound guilty on all counts. On that same day, Sconyers was sentenced to serve\\nlife in prison for malice murder and concurrent 20-year prison terms for\\naggravated assault and cruelty to children. The felony murder counts were\\nvacated by operation of law. The trial court later conducted a resentencing\\nhearing and, on May 25, 2022, entered a new sentence that merged the\\naggravated assault count into the malice murder conviction but did not change\\nthe other sentences. Sconyers filed a timely motion for new trial, which he\\namended on September 12, 2022. After a hearing on February 27, 2023, the\\ntrial court denied the amended motion for new trial on March 20, 2023.\\nSconyers filed a timely notice of appeal, and the case was docketed in this Court\\nto the term beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the\\nbriefs.\\n at trial showing that Sconyers and Finch lived together and that\\n\\nwhile Lincoln was at home in the sole care of Sconyers, Lincoln\\n\\nsustained a severe head injury that several medical experts testified\\n\\nwas not consistent with a ground-level fall on the patio as described\\n\\nby Sconyers. Lincoln died later at the hospital. Sconyers contends\\n\\nthat the trial court erred in four ways: repeatedly permitting the\\n\\nState to introduce evidence of previous injuries to Lincoln without\\n\\ncautioning the jury that the parties agreed that Sconyers did not\\n\\ncause those injuries; instructing the jury about “prior difficulties”\\n\\nbetween Sconyers and Lincoln without limiting what evidence\\n\\nqualified as prior difficulties; admitting hearsay statements\\n\\nallegedly made by Finch; and permitting the prosecution to impeach\\n\\nFinch improperly. For the reasons explained below, we affirm.\\n\\n     Sconyers had moved in with Lincoln and Finch, as well as her\\n\\nthen-four-year-old daughter, near the end of 2018. On May 1, 2019,\\n\\nFinch had to work until 6:00 p.m. and asked Sconyers, who was not\\n\\nworking his job as a firefighter and EMT because he had recently\\n\\nbeen injured, to pick up Lincoln from daycare while she went to the\\n\\n                                 2\\n grocery store. Surveillance video footage showed Finch at the\\n\\ngrocery store, and other video footage showed Sconyers leaving the\\n\\ndaycare with Lincoln at 6:19 p.m. An investigator testified that he\\n\\nreviewed surveillance video footage from the daycare for the whole\\n\\nday and did not observe anything that could have contributed to\\n\\nLincoln’s injuries. At some point, Sconyers called a friend and co-\\n\\nworker who was a paramedic and told him about an unconscious\\n\\nchild with breathing problems. The co-worker told Sconyers to\\n\\n“[h]ang up and call 911.” Sconyers called 911 at 6:36 p.m. and\\n\\nsubsequently called Finch, screaming that she needed “to get home\\n\\nnow” and that something happened to Lincoln. Sconyers said he did\\n\\nnot know what happened. There was no evidence that anyone other\\n\\nthan Sconyers was at the home with Lincoln at that time. Finch\\n\\narrived before emergency responders and ran into the bedroom\\n\\nwhere Lincoln was lying on the bed unresponsive with a “bulge” on\\n\\nthe right side of the top of his head, and Sconyers was trying to\\n\\nassess Lincoln as “an EMT should do” and “get his pupils to react.”\\n\\nWhen they heard sirens, Finch picked up Lincoln, ran with him, and\\n\\n                                3\\n begged Sconyers to take him to the ambulance. Sconyers took\\n\\nLincoln the rest of the way and was invited to ride in the ambulance\\n\\nto the hospital because Sconyers was an EMT.\\n\\n     The firefighters who first responded to the 911 call testified\\n\\nthat Lincoln was unresponsive and not breathing adequately and\\n\\nthat Sconyers told them Lincoln had a ground-level fall off a ledge\\n\\nonto concrete and had other bruises on his face and head because he\\n\\nhad a problem with sleepwalking. One of the two paramedics, who\\n\\narrived in an ambulance very soon after the firefighters, testified\\n\\nthat Lincoln was “posturing,” which typically happens after a severe\\n\\nclosed-head injury, and that based on her training and expertise the\\n\\ninjury did not appear to be caused by a ground-level fall. The witness\\n\\ntestified that Sconyers told her “two stories” in the back of the\\n\\nambulance: first, Lincoln was standing on a porch and fell about two\\n\\nto three feet off a ledge; and second, he fell on a “wheel chock”; and\\n\\nSconyers later told another paramedic that Lincoln slipped on a door\\n\\nthreshold and tripped and fell. The other paramedic also testified\\n\\nbased on her experience that Lincoln’s skull fracture was not\\n\\n                                  4\\n consistent with a fall of two to three feet. Sconyers kept repeating\\n\\nthat it was his “fault” if anything happened to Lincoln.\\n\\n     Finch testified that at the hospital, after Lincoln had surgery,\\n\\nSconyers told her that after getting home Lincoln wanted to go\\n\\noutside to play with chalk. Sconyers opened the outside door, went\\n\\nto the bathroom to take his knee brace off, and told Lincoln to go\\n\\noutside. Lincoln then “took off running,” and Sconyers heard a loud\\n\\nthump and a cry and ran to find Lincoln lying out back on the\\n\\nconcrete patio. Finch further testified that no one was at home with\\n\\nSconyers and Lincoln at the time, that she did not know of any prior\\n\\nfracture of Lincoln’s skull, and that she was not aware of anything\\n\\nprior to the fatal incident that could have resulted in any type of\\n\\nbrain injury to Lincoln.\\n\\n     Both parties presented medical experts who testified about\\n\\nLincoln’s injuries. Extensive testimony from the State’s experts\\n\\nshowed that the nature and severity of Lincoln’s fatal brain injury\\n\\nmade it highly unlikely the injury was caused accidentally by a fall\\n\\nat ground level or from a low height. One of those experts testified\\n\\n                                  5\\n that symptoms of that fatal injury would have appeared\\n\\nimmediately after the impact, and Lincoln could not have continued\\n\\nto move normally after sustaining those injuries. The GBI medical\\n\\nexaminer who performed an autopsy on Lincoln classified Lincoln’s\\n\\ndeath as a homicide because her examination and the medical\\n\\nrecords indicated that “non-accidental-inflicted trauma” caused the\\n\\nfatal injury and because the historical account of the incident\\n\\nprovided by Sconyers did not explain Lincoln’s injuries. One of\\n\\nSconyers’s medical experts testified that it was reasonably possible\\n\\nthat Lincoln’s fatal injury resulted from an accident, in part because\\n\\na prior head injury that caused a subdural hematoma made him\\n\\n“more prone to get a new one with more serious complications.”\\n\\n     Sconyers testified in his own defense as follows. He was a\\n\\nsergeant and advanced EMT with the Augusta Fire Department.\\n\\nThe week before Lincoln’s death, Sconyers and his lieutenant went\\n\\ninto a burning home to search for a little boy who was unaccounted\\n\\nfor at the time, and Sconyers fell through the floor, injuring his knee.\\n\\nFor that reason, Sconyers had a knee brace, was on leave, and was\\n\\n                                   6\\n able to pick up Lincoln from daycare on May 1, 2019. When they\\n\\narrived home, Sconyers told Lincoln he could play outside with chalk\\n\\nand opened the door for him. Sconyers went to use the bathroom and\\n\\nadjust his knee brace, and he told Lincoln to go outside. Lincoln\\n\\n“took off running,” and Sconyers heard a thump and heard Lincoln\\n\\n“almost scream.” Sconyers strapped his knee brace back on,\\n\\n“hobbled” outside as fast as he could, and found Lincoln lying\\n\\n“outside of [the] back patio.” Lincoln turned his head “just a little\\n\\nbit” and became unresponsive. Sconyers stabilized Lincoln’s neck\\n\\nand body, took him inside, and immediately called 911.\\n\\n     1. Sconyers contends that the trial court erred by permitting\\n\\nthe State repeatedly to introduce evidence of Lincoln’s previous\\n\\ninjuries without cautioning the jury that the parties agreed that\\n\\nSconyers did not cause those injuries.\\n\\n     Prior to the presentation of any evidence to the jury, Sconyers\\n\\nmoved under OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) (“Rule 404 (b)”) to exclude any\\n\\ntestimony that Lincoln “had black eyes on two different occasions”\\n\\nin the months before his death. Rule 404 (b) requires the exclusion\\n\\n                                 7\\n of “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts” the defendant may\\n\\nhave committed to prove the defendant’s bad character and show he\\n\\nacted “in conformity therewith” in committing the charged offense.\\n\\nSconyers argued that Lincoln’s prior black-eye injuries fell under\\n\\nRule 404 (b) because they were extrinsic to Lincoln’s death, and that\\n\\nthey had to be excluded under that rule because the State could not\\n\\nprove that Sconyers caused the injuries. But the prosecutor argued\\n\\nthat Lincoln’s prior injuries did not fall under Rule 404 (b) at all\\n\\nbecause they were intrinsic to the crime. See Roberts v. State, \\n315\\n\\nGa. 229\\n, 235 (2) (a) (\\n880 SE2d 501\\n) (2022) (“The limitations and\\n\\nprohibition on ‘other acts’ evidence set out in [Rule ]404 (b) do not\\n\\napply to ‘intrinsic evidence.’” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\nSpecifically, the prosecutor argued that the State needed to\\n\\nintroduce the prior injuries to explain the circumstances behind\\n\\nLincoln’s prior head injuries, because Sconyers’s expected defense\\n\\nwas that Lincoln’s prior head trauma – which caused the presence\\n\\nof both “old blood and new blood” in Lincoln’s brain, according to a\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 8\\n defense expert – could have contributed to his death. 2 The trial court\\n\\nagreed with the prosecution that the prior injuries were admissible\\n\\nas intrinsic evidence – not falling under Rule 404 (b) – because they\\n\\nallowed the State to explain and rebut the testimony of Sconyers’s\\n\\nexpert. See Johnson v. State, \\n312 Ga. 481\\n, 491 (4) (\\n863 SE2d 137\\n)\\n\\n(2021) (Evidence is intrinsic when it is “necessary to complete the\\n\\nstory of the crime.” (citation and punctuation omitted)). The trial\\n\\ncourt also found that the evidence satisfied OCGA § 24-4-403 (“Rule\\n\\n403”).\\n\\n      On appeal, Sconyers does not challenge the trial court’s ruling\\n\\nthat the prior injuries were admissible as intrinsic evidence.\\n\\nInstead, he raises a two-part argument that he did not raise below:\\n\\nthat the trial court allowed testimony about Lincoln’s previous\\n\\ninjuries to be repeatedly introduced3 and did not caution the jury\\n\\n\\n      2 One of the State’s medical experts also testified that surgery on Lincoln\\n\\nrevealed “old clot and new clot,” that is, “blood from a prior injury and blood\\nfrom this injury.”\\n      3 Sconyers described the evidence of Lincoln’s prior injuries as going “far\\n\\nbeyond merely providing a medical explanation for ‘old blood’” and having\\n“function[ed]” as additional evidence of “prior difficulties” between Sconyers\\nand Lincoln “through the State’s associations and inferences created through\\nrepetition and questioning.”\\n                                       9\\n that the parties agreed that Sconyers did not cause those injuries.\\n\\nBut Sconyers never objected on those bases in the trial court, and he\\n\\nnever requested a limiting instruction that the parties had agreed\\n\\nSconyers did not cause Lincoln’s prior injuries. This enumeration\\n\\ntherefore can be reviewed only for plain error. See OCGA §§ 17-8-58\\n\\n(b); 24-1-103 (a) (1); Henderson v. State, \\n317 Ga. 66\\n, 78 (4) (c) (\\n891\\n\\nSE2d 884\\n) (2023) (The appellant “did not ask for a limiting\\n\\ninstruction at trial, so we review his claim [that allowing certain\\n\\nevidence was error without an accompanying limiting instruction]\\n\\nonly for plain error.”); Payne v. State, \\n313 Ga. 218\\n, 221 (1) (\\n869 SE2d\\n\\n395\\n) (2022) (The appellant asserted on appeal that the trial court\\n\\nerred by admitting testimony about a certain incident because it “did\\n\\nnot qualify as a prior difficulty” under Rule 404 (b), but he “did not\\n\\nobject on the ground” asserted on appeal. “Thus, [he] failed to\\n\\npreserve [the enumerated] error for ordinary review.”). We see no\\n\\nplain error.\\n\\n     To show plain error, an appellant must identify an error that\\n\\nwas not affirmatively waived, was obvious beyond reasonable\\n\\n                                  10\\n dispute, affected the outcome of his trial or otherwise affected his\\n\\nsubstantial rights, and seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or\\n\\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings. See Henderson, 317 Ga. at\\n\\n78 (4) (c); Payne, 313 Ga. at 222 (1). “For an error to be obvious for\\n\\npurposes of plain error review, it must be plain under controlling\\n\\nprecedent or in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or\\n\\nrule.” Grier v. State, \\n313 Ga. 236\\n, 242 (3) (b) (\\n869 SE2d 423\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Sconyers’s claim of error relates to testimony from Finch, a\\n\\ndaycare employee, and a DFCS employee addressing Lincoln’s black\\n\\neyes. Finch testified that she saw Lincoln with black eyes on two\\n\\noccasions prior to his death. In February 2019, Lincoln was sleeping,\\n\\nand she and Sconyers were in the bathroom when they heard\\n\\nsomething. Sconyers left and returned “in a couple of seconds” with\\n\\nLincoln, who had a big “goose egg” in the middle of his head but was\\n\\n“grinning,” did not have dilated pupils, continued to act like a\\n\\n“normal” child the rest of the night, and was not lethargic or fussy.\\n\\nFinch believed Lincoln was injured a few times from sleepwalking,\\n\\n                                 11\\n and she discussed the situation with Lincoln’s pediatrician. Finch\\n\\ntestified that on April 29, 2019, while Finch’s mother was\\n\\nbabysitting Lincoln, he was climbing on his highchair when his foot\\n\\nslipped and he hit his eye on it. The defense later called Finch’s\\n\\nmother, who confirmed that when she was with Lincoln a day or two\\n\\nbefore his fatal injury, he injured himself on a highchair, causing a\\n\\nlittle bruise on the right side of his face.\\n\\n     An employee at the daycare center that Finch’s children\\n\\nattended, Brenda Warren, testified that in February 2019 she filled\\n\\nout an incident report when Lincoln arrived with two black eyes and\\n\\na bruised face, and Finch said he was jumping on his bed and hit the\\n\\ntop of it, but she did not take him to the doctor because her\\n\\n“boyfriend was a paramedic” and he did not feel it was necessary.\\n\\nBecause Finch’s comments “just didn’t seem right,” Warren\\n\\nultimately called Child Protective Services. Afterwards, Warren\\n\\nnoticed that Sconyers was not picking Lincoln up at the daycare\\n\\nanymore. Warren also testified to a second incident, on April 29,\\n\\n2019, two days before Lincoln’s death, when Lincoln had a black eye\\n\\n                                    12\\n and Warren was told that he had fallen, and a third incident, on May\\n\\n1, when Lincoln had a cut on his lip. Warren described Lincoln as an\\n\\n“active” and “happy” child who “napped well,” “ate well,” and played\\n\\nwith his friends on the playground.\\n\\n     The DFCS employee who investigated the two black-eye\\n\\nincidents testified that the daycare called DFCS because it was\\n\\n“concerned about the safety of the child” and felt that the incidents\\n\\nwere “too close” in time. As a result, she talked with Finch and\\n\\nSconyers and was told that Lincoln’s pediatrician had diagnosed him\\n\\nas a sleepwalker, and the first injury occurred when Lincoln fell\\n\\nwhile sleepwalking, and that the second injury occurred when\\n\\nLincoln fell on a highchair at his grandmother’s home.\\n\\n     We see no plain error because Sconyers’s claims related to this\\n\\ntestimony about the circumstances surrounding Lincoln’s prior\\n\\ninjuries do not show that the trial court acted contrary to any\\n\\ncontrolling authority. Sconyers contends the trial court should have\\n\\ninstructed the jury that the parties had agreed he did not cause\\n\\nLincoln’s prior injuries. But we are aware of no authority requiring\\n\\n                                 13\\n the court to give that limiting instruction. See Salvesen v. State, \\n317\\n\\nGa. 314\\n, 317 (2) (\\n893 SE2d 66\\n) (2023) (The State is “not required to\\n\\nstipulate to . . . the circumstances surrounding the murder.”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)); Anderson v. State, \\n313 Ga. 178\\n,\\n\\n183 (3) (a) (\\n869 SE2d 401\\n) (2022) (“[A] limiting instruction generally\\n\\nis not warranted for intrinsic evidence.”). Sconyers also contends\\n\\nthat too many witnesses testified about the prior injuries, but again,\\n\\nno authority required a limit on the number of those witnesses. The\\n\\nexistence of “some overlap” and “substantial prejudicial effect” in the\\n\\ntestimony of multiple witnesses does not necessarily make that\\n\\nevidence so needlessly cumulative or unfairly prejudicial as to\\n\\nrequire its exclusion under Rule 403. Naples v. State, \\n308 Ga. 43\\n, 53\\n\\n(2) (\\n838 SE2d 780\\n) (2020). Accordingly, it was not obvious either that\\n\\nsome of the testimony about Lincoln’s prior injuries should have\\n\\nbeen excluded or that the jury should have been instructed that\\n\\nSconyers did not cause those injuries. Sconyers therefore has failed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  14\\n to show error that is clear beyond reasonable dispute.4\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Sconyers also argues under this enumeration that certain evidence of\\n\\nhis prior difficulties with Lincoln – which we describe below in Division 3,\\nspecifically, Lincoln’s jealousy toward Sconyers, Sconyers hitting Lincoln, and\\nthe arguing and fighting between the two – was improperly admitted under\\nRule 404 (b). As an initial matter, Sconyers’s objection at trial did not extend\\nto this evidence, contrary to his contention on appeal. His specific objection in\\nthe trial court was only to testimony that Lincoln “had black eyes on two\\ndifferent occasions several months before the incident,” and Sconyers’s\\nsubsequent argument was limited to the black-eye injuries. Thus, this claim\\nalso can be reviewed only for plain error. See Payne, 313 Ga. at 221 (1).\\n       Sconyers argues that Lincoln’s jealousy was not admissible as “other act”\\nevidence under Rule 404 (b) because it was not an act at all, and also because\\nit was not relevant. But even if evidence of jealousy was not an “act” for\\npurposes of Rule 404 (b), it could be admissible as relevant evidence of the\\nnature of Sconyers’s poor relationship with Lincoln. See Shellman v. State, \\n318\\nGa. 71\\n, 77-78 (\\n897 SE2d 355\\n) (2024) (holding that evidence of the relationship\\nbetween the defendant and the victim, including jealousy, was relevant\\nbecause it shed light on the defendant’s motive in committing the charged\\noffenses). Rule 404 (b) is a “rule of inclusion,” State v. Jones, \\n297 Ga. 156\\n, 159\\n(2) (\\n773 SE2d 170\\n) (2015), so the fact that evidence may not be admissible\\nunder that rule does not mean that the rule excludes the evidence.\\n       Sconyers also argues generally that none of his prior difficulties with\\nLincoln were relevant except in a generic fashion to show motive. But evidence\\nof a defendant’s prior acts is ordinarily admissible in evidence under Rule 404\\n(b) “when the defendant is accused of a criminal act against that person, where\\nthe nature of the relationship between the defendant and the victim sheds light\\non the defendant’s motive in committing the offense charged.” Lowe v. State,\\n314 Ga. 788\\n, 793 (2) (a) (\\n879 SE2d 492\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation\\nomitted). Sconyers additionally contends that the prior-act evidence was not\\nadmissible under Rule 404 (b) because there was insufficient evidence to prove\\nthat he committed the acts. In his view, all of the evidence that he committed\\nthe prior acts was inadmissible hearsay from Finch’s co-workers. But as we\\nexplain more fully in Division 3, Sconyers did not object to the co-workers’\\ntestimony. By statute, “if a party does not properly object to hearsay, the\\nobjection shall be deemed waived, and the hearsay evidence shall be legal\\nevidence and admissible.” OCGA § 24-8-802. Sconyers has failed to show that\\n\\n                                       15\\n       2. Sconyers contends that the trial court erred when it\\n\\ninstructed the jury about “prior difficulties” between Sconyers and\\n\\nLincoln. The trial court instructed the jury as follows:\\n\\n           Evidence of prior difficulties between the defendant\\n      and the alleged victim, Lincoln Davitte, has been\\n      admitted for the sole purpose of illustrating, if it does, the\\n      state of feeling between the defendant and the alleged\\n      victim.\\n           Whether this evidence illustrates such matters is a\\n      matter solely for you, the jury, to determine, but you are\\n      not to consider such evidence for any other purpose.\\n\\nSconyers argues that this instruction failed to provide any limitation\\n\\nas to what evidence was subject to it, that the instruction improperly\\n\\nassumed there had been evidence of prior difficulties perpetrated by\\n\\nSconyers against Lincoln, and that the instruction did not define\\n\\n“state of feeling” even though that was the only determination the\\n\\ninstruction left to the jury and would naturally be inferred by the\\n\\njury. Although Sconyers objected to this instruction during the\\n\\ncharge conference, he did not object to it on any ground after the jury\\n\\n\\n\\nit is obvious beyond reasonable dispute that if he had properly objected under\\nRule 404 (b), the trial court would have abused its discretion in finding that\\nthe prior difficulties evidence met the requirements of that rule. Accordingly,\\nadmission of the prior difficulties into evidence does not amount to plain error.\\n                                       16\\n was charged. Thus, Sconyers did not properly preserve any of his\\n\\nclaims, and, indeed, he acknowledges that the instruction on prior\\n\\ndifficulties is subject to review for plain error only.

We see no plain error.\\n\\n      All of the language in the instruction on prior difficulties that\\n\\nSconyers now questions “was and is consistent with Georgia’s\\n\\npattern jury instructions[,] and [Sconyers] has not otherwise shown\\n\\nthat there was plain error.” Taylor v. State, \\n306 Ga. 277\\n, 286-287 (3)\\n\\n(c) (\\n830 SE2d 90\\n) (2019).5 Sconyers has pointed to no controlling\\n\\nprecedent holding that a trial court erred in connection with the\\n\\npattern charge on prior difficulties.

Sconyers has cited no authority that the\\n\\ninstruction at issue improperly recognizes that some evidence of\\n\\nprior difficulties had been admitted. And there is no authority\\n\\nrequiring a trial court to specify what evidence qualifies as prior\\n\\ndifficulties. See Chester v. State, \\n267 Ga. 9\\n, 12 (2) (\\n471 SE2d 836\\n)\\n\\n(1996) (holding that a trial court is not required to specifically point\\n\\nout particular evidence to which an instruction applies and that a\\n\\ntrial court should refuse to give jury charges that “are more adjusted\\n\\nto the exhortation of counsel than to the impartial clarity which\\n\\nshould characterize the instructions of the court” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)); see also Collins v. State, \\n312 Ga. 727\\n, 743 (7)\\n\\nn.15 (\\n864 SE2d 85\\n) (2021) (same). Because the instruction on prior\\n\\n                                  18\\n difficulties “did not involve a clear departure from a settled legal\\n\\nrule,” it did not amount to plain error. McKibbins, \\n293 Ga. at 854\\n\\n\\n(7).\\n\\n       3. Sconyers contends that the trial court erred by admitting\\n\\ntestimony about alleged hearsay statements made by Finch about\\n\\nSconyers’s and Lincoln’s arguing, and about Sconyers hitting\\n\\nLincoln. Sconyers argues that the State violated the requirement of\\n\\nOCGA § 24-6-613 (b) (“Rule 613 (b)”) that, before extrinsic evidence\\n\\nof a prior inconsistent statement can be admitted into evidence, the\\n\\nwitness must be “first afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the\\n\\nprior inconsistent statement.” However, because Sconyers failed to\\n\\nobject to the testimony at issue on any ground, he acknowledges that\\n\\nthis enumeration can be reviewed for plain error only. See OCGA §\\n\\n24-1-103 (a) (1); Payne, 313 Ga. at 221 (1).6 We see no error, much\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       6 See also Harvey v.

Another co-worker of Finch’s,\\n\\nSera Druelle, testified that Finch showed Druelle a photo where one\\n\\nof Lincoln’s eyes was swollen shut and attributed the injury to the\\n\\nsleepwalking. According to Druelle, Finch had never said anything\\n\\nabout Lincoln having behavioral issues until, about a week or a week\\n\\nand a half before the fatal incident, Finch said that she thought\\n\\nSconyers’s “true colors were starting to come out”; that when he was\\n\\ntrying to pick up Lincoln at the mall, Lincoln “got upset and started\\n\\npointing at [Sconyers], and Lincoln started hitting his own face,” and\\n\\nFinch “turned around and said [to Sconyers] did you hit him?”; and\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 20\\n that Lincoln “would have behavioral issues around [Sconyers].” 7\\n\\n     Finch testified at trial that she took Lincoln to counseling,\\n\\nwhich his doctor recommended in December 2018, because he had\\n\\ndeveloped “jealousy issues” with Sconyers. Finch also testified that\\n\\nshe and Sconyers were engaged at the time of trial and that she did\\n\\nnot believe that he injured Lincoln in any way. She denied that she\\n\\nremembered ever discussing with any of her co-workers that\\n\\nSconyers and Lincoln had been fighting. Finch also denied that there\\n\\nwas ever an incident at a mall when Lincoln indicated Sconyers had\\n\\nhit him and that she ever asked Sconyers if he had hit Lincoln\\n\\nbecause she and Sconyers were “always together.” Finch further\\n\\ndenied that she ever had any apprehensions about her relationship\\n\\nwith Sconyers or that Sconyers had a temper or argued with Lincoln.\\n\\nInstead, Finch testified, Sconyers and Lincoln “just played like\\n\\nfather and son.” Finch subsequently denied ever discussing with her\\n\\nco-workers the nature of her relationship with Sconyers. On cross-\\n\\n\\n     7  The DFCS employee also testified about a private interview with\\nLincoln’s sister, who said that Sconyers would spank Lincoln because he was\\ncrying.\\n                                    21\\n examination, Finch also denied ever telling anyone she worked with\\n\\nthat Sconyers “abuses Lincoln or anything like that”; she asserted\\n\\nthat she “wasn’t close with anybody in the office” and that she “really\\n\\nkept [her] personal stuff to [her]self.”\\n\\n     “[P]rior inconsistent statements that meet the requirements of\\n\\n[Rule ]613 (b) are not hearsay if the declarant testifies at trial and\\n\\nis subject to cross-examination.

But as Bridgewater and Murdock indicate, Finch’s\\n\\nfailure to recall making any statement at all about fighting, abuse,\\n\\nor anything like that, as well as her denial of the mall incident and\\n\\nSconyers arguing with Lincoln, relieved the prosecutor of the need\\n\\nto ask about specific statements.

Sconyers contends that the trial court erred by permitting\\n\\nthe prosecution to impeach Finch with alleged bias through the\\n\\ntestimony of Leslie Morgan, who was the guardian ad litem\\n\\nappointed in Finch’s case in juvenile court involving her daughter’s\\n\\n                                     24\\n custody and visitation. We see no error.\\n\\n     During her direct examination, Finch testified that her\\n\\ndaughter had not been in her custody since Lincoln’s death and that\\n\\nshe was not offered any opportunity to be able to see her daughter\\n\\non a more regular basis, nor any type of visitation by the juvenile\\n\\ncourt. Morgan later testified that Finch was offered the opportunity\\n\\nto have a visitation plan with her daughter, but that it was not ever\\n\\naccomplished. Morgan explained that she was part of a conference\\n\\ncall with the juvenile court judge and two others, during which an\\n\\nagreement was reached that the child’s therapist would help\\n\\nfacilitate a supervised visit on the condition that Finch would sign\\n\\nan affidavit that she is no longer seeing or dating Sconyers, but\\n\\nFinch never executed the affidavit. On cross-examination, Morgan\\n\\nagreed that neither Finch nor her attorney was on the conference\\n\\ncall, but she named someone from the office of Finch’s attorney as\\n\\nbeing on the call. Although Finch was aware that there was going to\\n\\nbe a conference call addressing visitation, Morgan was not sure what\\n\\nFinch’s attorney told her after the call.\\n\\n                                  25\\n      Sconyers objects to Morgan’s testimony on two bases. First, he\\n\\ncontends that her testimony was not based on personal knowledge\\n\\nand therefore was not admissible under OCGA § 24-6-602 (“Rule\\n\\n602”). Second, he contends that her testimony did not establish a\\n\\nspecific instance of Finch’s conduct showing that she was biased in\\n\\nfavor of Sconyers, and therefore was not admissible to show her\\n\\ncharacter for untruthfulness under OCGA § 24-6-608 (b) (“Rule 608\\n\\n(b)”). Because Sconyers raised only the Rule 608 (b) objection at trial,\\n\\nwe review his Rule 602 argument only for plain error. See OCGA §\\n\\n24-1-103 (a) (1); Henderson, 317 Ga. at 78 (4) (c). 8 We address the\\n\\narguments in turn.\\n\\n     (a) Rule 602 generally prohibits a witness from testifying “to a\\n\\nmatter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding\\n\\nthat the witness has personal knowledge of such matter. Evidence\\n\\nto prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     8 See also Brown v. State, \\n314 Ga. 193\\n, 199 (3) (\\n875 SE2d 784\\n) (2022)\\n\\n(Because the appellant did not object to certain testimony on the ground that\\nthe witnesses lacked personal knowledge so as to preserve ordinary appellate\\nreview on that issue, it could be reviewed only for plain error.).\\n                                     26\\n witness’s own testimony.” Under that rule, as under the\\n\\ncorresponding federal rule, “witnesses may testify about events they\\n\\npersonally observed.” Draughn v. State, \\n311 Ga. 378\\n, 385 (4) (\\n858\\n\\nSE2d 8\\n) (2021). But “a court should exclude testimony for lack of\\n\\npersonal knowledge if the witness could not have actually perceived\\n\\nor observed that which he testifies to.” Kirby v. State, \\n304 Ga. 472\\n,\\n\\n478 (3) (b) (\\n819 SE2d 468\\n) (2018) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Morgan’s testimony made clear the limit of her personal\\n\\nknowledge,   i.e., that her knowledge of Finch’s          unfulfilled\\n\\nopportunity for a visitation plan with her daughter was based\\n\\nentirely on a conference call in which someone from the office of\\n\\nFinch’s attorney participated. Morgan did not state an opinion or\\n\\ninference about Finch’s knowledge or actions. To the contrary,\\n\\nMorgan’s testimony was “not impermissible opinion testimony” but\\n\\nwas “straightforward factual testimony regarding matters within\\n\\n[her] personal knowledge,” Cooper v. State, \\n317 Ga. 676\\n, 685 (2) (\\n895\\n\\nSE2d 285\\n) (2023), only about what she “actually perceived,” Kirby,\\n\\n304 Ga. at 478\\n (3) (b). Thus, we see no violation of Rule 602, much\\n\\n                                 27\\n less a violation that is obvious beyond reasonable dispute.\\n\\n     (b) Rule 608 (b) generally prohibits proof by extrinsic evidence\\n\\nof “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of\\n\\nattacking or supporting the witness’s character for truthfulness,”\\n\\nexcept for a conviction of a crime as provided in OCGA § 24-6-609 or\\n\\n“conduct indicative of the witness’s bias toward a party.” Sconyers’s\\n\\nargument about what Morgan’s testimony proved goes to its\\n\\nrelevance to meet the exception in Rule 608 (b) for “conduct\\n\\nindicative of the witness’s bias toward a party.” The value of\\n\\nMorgan’s testimony lay in its tendency both to disprove Finch’s\\n\\ntestimony denying any offer or opportunity for visitation and to\\n\\nprove bias on her part in favor of Sconyers. See OCGA § 24-4-401\\n\\n(“Rule 401”) (defining “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any\\n\\ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to\\n\\nthe determination of the action more probable or less probable than\\n\\nit would be without the evidence”). Morgan’s testimony – that Finch\\n\\nknew about the conference call and her attorney had a\\n\\nrepresentative on the call – permitted the natural, reasonable\\n\\n                                  28\\n inference that Morgan accurately reported the substance of the\\n\\nconference call in which she participated in her official role as\\n\\nguardian ad litem, that Finch’s attorney performed her duty to\\n\\nascertain what happened on the call and inform Finch of the\\n\\nvisitation offer, and that Finch therefore was offered and declined a\\n\\nvisitation plan if she stopped seeing Sconyers. In other words,\\n\\nMorgan’s testimony established that – contrary to Finch’s own\\n\\ntestimony – Finch was offered a visitation plan with her older\\n\\ndaughter, but declined to go along with that plan because it required\\n\\nher to stop seeing Sconyers. See Fitts v. State, \\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 142 (3)\\n\\n(\\n859 SE2d 79\\n) (2021) (“When considering circumstantial evidence,\\n\\njurors are entitled to draw reasonable inferences based on their own\\n\\ncommon-sense understanding of the world that are ordinarily drawn\\n\\nby ordinary people in the light of their experience in everyday life.”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     In its ruling, the trial court properly relied on OCGA § 24-6-\\n\\n621 (“Rule 621”), which provides that “[a] witness may be impeached\\n\\nby disproving the facts testified to by the witness.” It is true that\\n\\n                                 29\\n this statute does not authorize the use of “extrinsic evidence to\\n\\nimpeach a witness by contradiction” on a matter that is “wholly\\n\\nimmaterial” or “purely collateral” to the material issues at trial.\\n\\nScott v. State, \\n309 Ga. 764\\n, 770-771 (3) (c) (\\n848 SE2d 448\\n) (2020).9\\n\\nBut the nature and depth of Finch’s relationship with Sconyers was\\n\\nrelevant to the jury’s assessment of the material issue of her\\n\\npotential bias. See McNabb v. State, \\n313 Ga. 701\\n, 715 (2) (b) (i) (\\n872\\n\\nSE2d 251\\n) (2020) (“[T]he nature of the relationships between the\\n\\nwitnesses and defendants was relevant, as the jury’s understanding\\n\\nof a familial relationship between a defendant and a witness could\\n\\naffect the jury’s assessment of the witness’s credibility or potential\\n\\nbias    and   provide     context    for   the   witness’s     testimony.”).10\\n\\nConsequently, it was within the trial court’s discretion to admit\\n\\n\\n       9 Scott properly relied on case law under former OCGA § 24-9-82, in\\n\\naddition to current Rule 621, because that current rule was carried over from\\nthe old Evidence Code and has no federal corollary.\\n      10 See also OCGA § 24-6-622 (“Rule 622”) (“The state of a witness’s\\n\\nfeelings towards the parties and the witness’s relationship to the parties may\\nalways be proved for the consideration of the jury.”); Virger v.

ANDERSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PINSON, Justice.\\n\\n        Clark Chandler Anderson shot and killed Kevin Murr. At trial,\\n\\nAnderson argued the killing was voluntary manslaughter, not\\n\\nmurder, because he shot Murr after being seriously provoked, but\\n\\nthe jury found Anderson guilty of malice murder. On appeal,\\n\\nAnderson contends that insufficient evidence supported his\\n\\nconvictions, that the trial court should have given Anderson’s\\n\\nrequested jury instruction about voluntary manslaughter, and that\\n\\nhis trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to three pieces of\\n\\ntestimony from his coworkers that, in Anderson’s view, were\\n\\ninadmissible character evidence.\\n\\n        We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support\\n\\nAnderson’s conviction for malice murder because it showed that he\\n intentionally shot Murr 16 times. We further conclude that no jury\\n\\ninstruction about voluntary manslaughter was required because the\\n\\nprovocation that Anderson claims—Murr yelling and cursing at him\\n\\nand threatening to get a gun—was not enough to excite the “sudden,\\n\\nviolent, and irresistible passion” that could warrant a jury\\n\\ninstruction on voluntary manslaughter. And counsel was not\\n\\nineffective for failing to object to the coworkers’ testimony: counsel\\n\\nwanted the jury to hear some of the testimony because it would serve\\n\\ncounsel’s strategy of trying to evoke the jury’s sympathy, and\\n\\nAnderson suffered no prejudice from the remaining testimony. So\\n\\nwe affirm Anderson’s convictions.\\n\\n      1. Anderson was convicted of malice murder and other crimes\\n\\nin connection with the shooting death of Murr. 1 The evidence at trial\\n\\n\\n      1 The shooting occurred on June 7, 2020. On October 28, 2020, a Paulding\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Anderson for malice murder, felony murder\\npredicated on aggravated assault, aggravated assault of Murr, aggravated\\nassault of Carol Anderson, and possession of a firearm during the commission\\nof a felony. He was tried by a jury from June 6 to 8, 2022. The jury found\\nAnderson not guilty of the aggravated assault of Carol Anderson but guilty of\\nthe remaining charges. He was sentenced to life in prison without the\\npossibility of parole for malice murder, with a consecutive term of five years in\\nprison for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The\\n\\n                                       2\\n showed the following.\\n\\n      Anderson lived with his mother, Carol, and Carol’s fiancé,\\n\\nMurr. Carol and Murr had been together for nine and a half years,\\n\\nand Carol and Anderson had moved in with Murr about a year before\\n\\nthe shooting. Carol described Anderson and Murr’s relationship as\\n\\n“generally good,” although she acknowledged that Anderson “was a\\n\\nlittle distrustful” and that the two “were both a little back and forth\\n\\nsometimes.”\\n\\n      Anderson and Murr’s relationship grew more fraught a few\\n\\nmonths before the shooting. Starting around that time, Anderson\\n\\ndescribed Murr to coworkers as an “evil piece of s**t” and said he\\n\\nhated Murr and wanted to kill him. In Anderson’s text messages to\\n\\na coworker from about three months before the shooting, which were\\n\\nread to the jury, Anderson said he would probably kill Murr “and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nremaining counts were merged or vacated by operation of law. Anderson filed\\na timely motion for new trial, which he later amended through new counsel.\\nAfter a hearing and supplemental briefing, the trial court denied the motion\\nfor new trial, as amended, on October 23, 2023. Anderson filed a timely notice\\nof appeal. His case was docketed to the term of Court beginning in December\\n2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                      3\\n shoot it out with the cops,” and that killing Murr would be “easier\\n\\nthan killing [an] ISIS or Taliban solider.”\\n\\n     On the morning of the shooting, Anderson left the house early\\n\\nto go to work. Murr and Carol stayed home all day. When Anderson\\n\\nreturned home in the evening, he said he was tired and went to his\\n\\nroom.\\n\\n     A little later, Murr angrily went to Anderson’s closed bedroom\\n\\ndoor. He began “banging on the door,” “screaming,” and “yelling” at\\n\\nAnderson to come out and take a shower. Anderson—who had not\\n\\nshowered for “upwards to about a month”—responded repeatedly\\n\\nthat he would do it in the morning. During this commotion, Carol\\n\\ncame out from the main bedroom into the hallway to see what the\\n\\ntrouble was. Murr told her to “get the F back in there,” but Carol\\n\\nremained in the hall.\\n\\n     Suddenly things grew “eerily quiet.” Carol and Murr heard a\\n\\nclicking from inside Anderson’s room, which they recognized as the\\n\\nsound of his gun. Ordinarily Carol and Murr would “roll [their] eyes”\\n\\nwhen they heard that clicking sound, because they knew Anderson\\n\\n                                  4\\n was just playing with the gun. But this time it “felt different . . .\\n\\nbecause of the yelling” that had just happened.\\n\\n     Shots rang out. Murr was hit through the closed door. Other\\n\\nbullets hit the wall near where Carol was standing. Murr screamed\\n\\nout, “GD you hit me,” and ran towards the kitchen. Carol followed.\\n\\nAnderson emerged from his room and, in his own words, “kept\\n\\nshooting” at Murr until his gun was empty—16 rounds in all. Murr\\n\\nreached the kitchen and fell to the floor. He died soon after.\\n\\n     Murr had been hit five times in the chest and back. The bullets,\\n\\nbullet holes, and spent shell casings found around his body\\n\\nsuggested that Anderson had fired some of those shots after Murr\\n\\nwas on the ground. Nevertheless, Carol testified that Anderson\\n\\nperformed CPR on Murr, to no avail, and that Anderson said, “Oh,\\n\\nGod, what have I done, what have I done, oh, F, what have I done .\\n\\n. . mom, I’m sorry, mom, I’m sorry, God, I’m sorry.” Carol,\\n\\nmeanwhile, called 9-1-1.\\n\\n     Sheriff’s deputies arrived at the scene. The first responding\\n\\nofficer found Anderson and Carol on the front steps of the house.\\n\\n                                  5\\n Anderson’s hands were covered in blood. He told the officer he had\\n\\nshot Murr multiple times with a handgun.\\n\\n     Police took Anderson to the sheriff’s office. There, Anderson\\n\\nwaived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (86 SCt\\n\\n1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966), and gave a recorded statement, portions\\n\\nof which were played for the jury. In the statement, Anderson\\n\\nadmitted that he shot Murr. He said repeatedly that he was not\\n\\nangry at Murr and did not lose his temper, but rather feared for\\n\\nhimself and his mother because Murr had threatened to get his own\\n\\ngun. According to Anderson, when Murr was pounding on the\\n\\nbedroom door, Anderson “racked the slide [of his gun] as a\\n\\ndeterrent.” Despite that deterrent, Murr eventually broke through\\n\\nthe locked door. Anderson then pushed the door closed and shot\\n\\nMurr through the closed door.\\n\\n     At least one part of Anderson’s statement was undercut by\\n\\nother trial evidence. Although Anderson claimed that Murr had\\n\\nbroken through the locked bedroom door, an officer testified that the\\n\\ndoor was undamaged—except for the bullet holes.\\n\\n                                 6\\n      2. Anderson contends that the evidence at trial was not\\n\\nsufficient as a matter of constitutional due process to support his\\n\\nconviction for malice murder. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\\n\\n319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). “We evaluate a due\\n\\nprocess challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence by viewing the\\n\\nevidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the\\n\\nverdicts, and asking whether any rational trier of fact could have\\n\\nfound the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes\\n\\nof which he was convicted.” Henderson v. State, 317 Ga. 66, 72 (2)\\n\\n(891 SE2d 884) (2023). “We leave to the jury the resolution of\\n\\nconflicts or inconsistencies in the evidence, credibility of witnesses,\\n\\nand reasonable inferences to be derived from the facts.” Perkins v.\\n\\nState, 313 Ga. 885, 891 (2) (a) (873 SE2d 185) (2022) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Under that standard, the evidence at Anderson’s trial was\\n\\nsufficient to sustain his malice murder conviction. A person is guilty\\n\\nof malice murder if “he unlawfully and with malice aforethought,\\n\\neither express or implied, causes the death of another human being.”\\n\\n                                  7\\n OCGA § 16-5-1 (a). At Anderson’s trial, it was undisputed that\\n\\nAnderson shot Murr. Not only that, but he shot him multiple times,\\n\\npursued him to the kitchen, and continued firing until the gun was\\n\\nempty. Although Anderson had told police that he shot Murr out of\\n\\nfear, he never asserted an affirmative defense of justification, asked\\n\\nfor a jury instruction on self-defense, or otherwise claimed at trial\\n\\nthat he shot Murr in self-defense. To the contrary, the evidence\\n\\nshowed that in the months leading up to the shooting, Anderson had\\n\\ntold his colleagues that he hated Murr and fantasized about killing\\n\\nhim. Presented with that evidence and the evidence at trial and\\n\\nrecounted in part above, a reasonable jury could find beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt Anderson killed Murr with malice aforethought.\\n\\nSee Neason v. State, 317 Ga. 695, 698-699 (895 SE2d 278) (2023)\\n\\n(evidence sufficient to support malice murder conviction when\\n\\nmultiple witnesses saw defendant shoot victim and defendant had\\n\\nmotive to kill victim); Whittaker v. State, 317 Ga. 127, 131 (2) (891\\n\\nSE2d 849) (2023) (evidence sufficient to support malice murder\\n\\nconviction when defendant stabbed victim 50 times and strangled\\n\\n                                  8\\n him, because defendant’s “brutal and excessive actions . . .\\n\\nsupport[ed] the jury’s finding of the requisite malice and intent”).\\n\\n     Anderson contends on appeal that he “raised an affirmative\\n\\ndefense” that the killing was voluntary manslaughter, rather than\\n\\nmurder, because he “committed this crime out of a sudden, violent,\\n\\nand irresistible passion,” and that the State failed to disprove that\\n\\ndefense beyond a reasonable doubt. But voluntary manslaughter is\\n\\na separate offense, not an affirmative defense to murder, so the\\n\\nState was not required to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. See\\n\\nOCGA §§ 16-3-20 to 16-3-28 (listing affirmative defenses); Wyman v.\\n\\nState, 278 Ga. 339, 340-341 (3) (602 SE2d 619) (2004) (voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter is not a defense to murder); cf. Clark v. State, 307 Ga.\\n\\n537, 539-540 (1) (837 SE2d 265) (2019) (“When a defendant raises\\n\\nan affirmative defense that is supported by some evidence, the State\\n\\nhas the burden of disproving that defense beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt.”). And as explained in Division 4, no evidence supported a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter conviction in any event.\\n\\n     3. Anderson also argues that this Court should reverse his\\n\\n                                  9\\n conviction under the “general grounds” in OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-\\n\\n21. Those Code sections allow a trial court, on a motion for new trial,\\n\\nto reverse a conviction if the conviction is “contrary to evidence and\\n\\nthe principles of justice and equity,” OCGA § 5-5-20, or “decidedly\\n\\nand strongly against the weight of the evidence,” OCGA § 5-5-21.\\n\\nBut when we determine that the trial court has exercised its\\n\\ndiscretion under OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-21, we do not review the\\n\\nmerits of the general grounds on appeal. The decision whether to\\n\\nreverse a conviction on the general grounds is left to the sole\\n\\ndiscretion of the trial court. See, e.g., Adams v. State, 318 Ga. 105,\\n\\n114 (2) (897 SE2d 396) (2024); King v. State, 316 Ga. 611, 616 (2)\\n\\n(889 SE2d 851) (2023); Ridley v. State, 315 Ga. 452, 456 (3) (883\\n\\nSE2d 357) (2023); Bundel v. State, 308 Ga. 317, 318 (1) (840 SE2d\\n\\n349) (2020); Strother v. State, 305 Ga. 838, 843 (3) (828 SE2d 327)\\n\\n(2019). Here, the trial court noted that it “ha[d] considered but\\n\\ndecline[d] to grant a new trial under the general grounds.” Absent\\n\\naffirmative evidence to the contrary—and there is none here—we\\n\\npresume that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in\\n\\n                                  10\\n denying a motion for new trial on the general grounds. 2 See, e.g.,\\n\\nWard v. State, 316 Ga. 295, 299 (3) (888 SE2d 75) (2023).\\n\\n      Separately, Anderson contends that his conviction should be\\n\\nreversed under OCGA § 5-5-25, which allows a court to grant a new\\n\\ntrial “on other grounds not provided for in this Code” if the court\\n\\nfinds that relief is required “according to the provisions of the\\n\\ncommon law and practice of the courts.” But Anderson does not point\\n\\nto any “other grounds” or support his contention with argument or\\n\\nexplanation. “[T]his Court is not required to scour the record for\\n\\nsupport for an appellant’s arguments,” Davis v. State, 306 Ga. 140,\\n\\n144 (3) (829 SE2d 321) (2019), and we decline to do so here. So\\n\\nAnderson’s claim on this ground also fails.\\n\\n      4. Anderson contends that the trial court erred by refusing to\\n\\n\\n      2 In the past, when evaluating a trial court’s denial of a motion for new\\n\\ntrial on the general grounds, we have sometimes reviewed the sufficiency of\\nthe evidence as a matter of constitutional due process under Jackson, 443 U.S.\\n307. See, e.g., Montgomery v. State, 315 Ga. 467, 474 (3) (883 SE2d 351) (2023).\\nMany of us “question whether it is proper for this Court to import Jackson into\\nan appellate review of the general grounds.” King, 316 Ga. at 616 (2) n.8. But\\nwe need not resolve that question here, because Anderson’s general-grounds\\nclaim fails in any event: the trial court exercised its discretion to deny the\\nclaim, and, as we explained above, the evidence was constitutionally sufficient\\nto affirm Anderson’s convictions. See id.\\n                                      11\\n give his requested jury instruction about voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\nVoluntary manslaughter is the killing of another person, “under\\n\\ncircumstances which would otherwise be murder,” where the\\n\\nperpetrator “acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and\\n\\nirresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient to\\n\\nexcite such passion in a reasonable person.” OCGA § 16-5-2 (a).\\n\\nWhen a defendant requests a jury instruction on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter, as Anderson did here, the trial court must give the\\n\\ninstruction if there is “slight evidence” to support it—that is, if there\\n\\nis slight evidence that the defendant, in killing the victim, acted\\n\\nunder a “serious provocation” that could excite a “sudden, violent,\\n\\nand irresistible passion” in a reasonable person. See Mobley v. State,\\n\\n314 Ga. 38, 42 (875 SE2d 655) (2022) (citations and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). The existence, or not, of that “slight evidence” is a question\\n\\nof law. See id. at 42-43. And when, as here, a defendant properly\\n\\npreserves a claim that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct\\n\\nthe jury on an applicable principle of law, that claim is reviewed de\\n\\nnovo. See Eubanks v. State, 317 Ga. 563, 581 (3) (b) (894 SE2d 27)\\n\\n                                   12\\n (2023).\\n\\n     The trial court here did not err in refusing to give a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter instruction because no evidence supported giving one.\\n\\nAnderson contends that he was seriously provoked by Murr\\n\\npounding on the door, yelling and cursing at him, and threatening\\n\\nto get a gun. But threats and insults on their own are not enough to\\n\\nsupport a voluntary manslaughter instruction. See, e.g., Smith v.\\n\\nState, 296 Ga. 731, 737 (3) (770 SE2d 610) (2015) (“[N]either fear\\n\\nthat someone is going to pull a gun nor fighting are the types of\\n\\nprovocation which demand a voluntary manslaughter charge.”);\\n\\nRountree v. State, 316 Ga. 691, 694-695 (2) (889 SE2d 803) (2023)\\n\\n(“threatening words and racial epithets” did not amount to serious\\n\\nprovocation, “no matter how menacing or offensive they were” to the\\n\\ndefendant); Hudson v. State, 308 Ga. 443, 446 (2) (a) (841 SE2d 696)\\n\\n(2020) (voluntary manslaughter instruction not required where\\n\\nvictim used crude and insulting language toward defendant,\\n\\nbecause “[t]here was no evidence whatsoever of provocation\\n\\nsufficient to excite the passions of a reasonable person”). Here, the\\n\\n                                 13\\n evidence was that Murr yelled and cursed at Anderson, told him to\\n\\ntake a shower, and threatened to get his gun. Those threats and\\n\\ninsults, no matter how offensive to Anderson, did not subject him to\\n\\na provocation that would reduce his crime from murder to voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. See Smith, 296 Ga. at 737 (3). The trial court thus\\n\\ndid not err in declining to give the instruction. See Hudson, 308 Ga.\\n\\nat 446 (2) (a).\\n\\n     Anderson also contends the trial court was required to give a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter instruction because it was his “sole\\n\\ndefense” at trial. See Price v. State, 289 Ga. 459, 459-460 (2) (712\\n\\nSE2d 828) (2011) (“The trial court must charge the jury on the\\n\\ndefendant’s sole defense, even without a written request, if there is\\n\\nsome evidence to support the charge.”) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). But voluntary manslaughter is a distinct offense, not a\\n\\ndefense to murder. See Wyman, 278 Ga. at 340-341 (3). And in any\\n\\nevent, as discussed above, no evidence supported the charge. See\\n\\nPrice, 289 Ga. at 459 (2).\\n\\n     5. Anderson contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective\\n\\n                                 14\\n assistance by failing to object to certain testimony from Anderson’s\\n\\ncoworkers. In Anderson’s view, that testimony was character\\n\\nevidence that would have been excluded under OCGA §§ 24-4-404\\n\\n(a) and 24-4-405 (a) had his counsel objected. See OCGA § 24-4-404\\n\\n(a) (“[e]vidence of a person’s character or a trait of character shall\\n\\nnot be admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity\\n\\ntherewith on a particular occasion,” subject to certain exceptions\\n\\nthat the State did not rely on here); OCGA § 24-4-405 (a) (requiring\\n\\nthat, whenever evidence of character is admissible, “proof shall be\\n\\nmade by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of\\n\\nan opinion”).\\n\\n     (a) Anderson identifies three pieces of testimony that he says\\n\\ncounsel should have tried to exclude. First, two of his coworkers\\n\\ntestified that he sometimes brought guns to work. Second, the same\\n\\ntwo coworkers testified that Anderson falsely claimed to have served\\n\\nin the military, with one recalling that Anderson said he suffered\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 15\\n from post-traumatic stress disorder.3 Finally, one coworker testified\\n\\nthat while she was giving Anderson a ride home from work a few\\n\\nweeks before the murder, she asked if Anderson wanted to move\\n\\nfrom the back seat of her car to the front seat, and he replied,\\n\\n“[W]hat do you think I’m going to rape you or something?”\\n\\n      At the hearing on Anderson’s motion for a new trial, trial\\n\\ncounsel was asked why he did not try to exclude the coworkers’\\n\\ntestimony about Anderson bringing guns to work or lying about\\n\\nmilitary service. (He was not asked why he did not try to exclude the\\n\\ntestimony about Anderson’s comment about rape.) In response,\\n\\ncounsel explained how the coworkers’ testimony served his trial\\n\\nstrategy of trying to gain the jury’s sympathy. Counsel recalled that\\n\\nAnderson, in a part of his recorded interview that the jury would\\n\\nsee, had talked about being too small in stature to join the police or\\n\\nthe military. Counsel said he played up that idea in his opening\\n\\n\\n      3 The witnesses did not explicitly characterize Anderson’s claims about\\n\\nmilitary service as untrue, but it was (and is) undisputed that Anderson never\\nserved. The State argued in closing that it was obviously untrue that Anderson\\nhad ever served in the military, and pointed out that his mother testified that\\nhe had never had another job.\\n                                      16\\n statement to argue that Anderson’s small stature had prevented\\n\\nhim from achieving his goals and left him frustrated. In counsel’s\\n\\nview, the challenged testimony from Anderson’s coworkers—that\\n\\nAnderson lied about military service and displayed guns at work—\\n\\nfit the same narrative. Counsel testified that he made a “strategic\\n\\ndecision to just let it all in and give the jury the full picture of what\\n\\nwas going on,” because Anderson’s “only real shot at anything” was\\n\\nto generate sympathy from the jury.\\n\\n     (b) To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a\\n\\ndefendant must show both that counsel’s performance was\\n\\nprofessionally deficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result.\\n\\nSee Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (III) (104 SCt 2052,\\n\\n80 LE2d 674) (1984); Washington v. State, 313 Ga. 771, 773 (3) (873\\n\\nSE2d 132) (2022). “If an appellant fails to meet his or her burden of\\n\\nproving either prong of the Strickland test, the reviewing court does\\n\\nnot have to examine the other prong.” Taylor v. State, 315 Ga. 630,\\n\\n647 (5) (b) (884 SE2d 346) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     To prove deficiency, a defendant “must show that his lawyer\\n\\n                                   17\\n performed his duties in an objectively unreasonable way,\\n\\nconsidering all the circumstances and in the light of prevailing\\n\\nprofessional norms.” Scott v. State, 317 Ga. 218, 221 (2) (892 SE2d\\n\\n744) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). This is “no easy\\n\\nshowing,” id. (citation and punctuation omitted), because the law\\n\\nrecognizes a “strong presumption that trial counsel’s conduct falls\\n\\nwithin the broad range of reasonable professional conduct,” Harper\\n\\nv. State, 318 Ga. 185, 192 (1) (897 SE2d 818) (2024) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). To overcome that presumption, the appellant\\n\\nmust show that “no reasonable lawyer would have done what his\\n\\nlawyer did, or would have failed to do what his lawyer did not.”\\n\\nWashington, 313 Ga. at 773 (3) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n“In particular, decisions regarding trial tactics and strategy may\\n\\nform the basis for an ineffectiveness claim only if they were so\\n\\npatently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have\\n\\nfollowed such a course.” Waters v. State, 317 Ga. 822, 829 (3) (b) (896\\n\\nSE2d 507) (2023) (citation and punctuation).\\n\\n     To show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient\\n\\n                                  18\\n performance, a defendant must show that, but for the deficiency,\\n\\nthere was a “reasonable probability” that the result of the trial\\n\\nwould have been different. See Waters, 317 Ga. at 829 (3) (b). “A\\n\\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\\n\\nconfidence in the outcome.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     With these standards in mind, we review in turn each piece of\\n\\ntestimony that Anderson contends his counsel should have tried to\\n\\nexclude.\\n\\n     (i) Counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to object to the\\n\\ncoworkers’ testimony about Anderson bringing guns to work and\\n\\nlying about military service. Counsel testified that his strategy at\\n\\ntrial—indeed, his “only real shot at anything”—was to play on the\\n\\njury’s sympathy in the hope that the jury would find that Anderson\\n\\nacted without malice. That strategy was reasonable under the\\n\\ncircumstances. See Earnest v. State, 262 Ga. 494, 496-497 (5) (422\\n\\nSE2d 188) (1992) (strategy of trying to invoke the jury’s sympathy\\n\\nis “within the range of professionally reasonable decisions”). Counsel\\n\\npursued his strategy by trying to give the jury “the full picture of\\n\\n                                  19\\n what was going on” with Anderson. For counsel, that meant\\n\\nportraying Anderson as a man whose small stature prevented him\\n\\nfrom joining the police or the military, and who may have\\n\\ncompensated for those frustrations by enacting fantasies of military\\n\\nservice around his coworkers. The coworkers’ testimony, especially\\n\\nlayered with Anderson’s own statements to police, helped complete\\n\\nthat “full picture.” So it was reasonable for counsel not to object to\\n\\nit. See Jones v. State, 300 Ga. 543, 546 (2) (a) (796 SE2d 659) (2017)\\n\\n(reasonable strategy not to object to evidence that “might be useful\\n\\nto create sympathy for the [defendants] and convince a jury that\\n\\nthey did not act with malice”).\\n\\n     Because counsel’s decision not to object was part of a\\n\\nreasonable trial strategy, it fell within the “broad range of\\n\\nreasonable professional conduct.” See Harper, 318 Ga. at 192 (1);\\n\\nWaters, 317 Ga. at 829 (3) (b); Jones, 300 Ga. at 546 (2) (a). The fact\\n\\nthat the strategy did not carry the day does not mean it was unsound\\n\\nor that counsel’s performance was deficient. See Grissom v. State,\\n\\n296 Ga. 406, 412 (4) (768 SE2d 494) (2015) (counsel’s strategic\\n\\n                                  20\\n decisions “must not be judged by hindsight or the ultimate result of\\n\\nthe trial”) (citation and punctuation omitted). So Anderson’s claim\\n\\nof ineffectiveness on this ground fails.\\n\\n     (ii) We turn next to the coworker’s testimony about Anderson’s\\n\\ncomment about rape. Counsel was not asked why he did not object\\n\\nto that testimony, so he never had a chance to explain (as he did\\n\\nwith the other challenged evidence) how it might fit into a trial\\n\\nstrategy. But even if no reasonable lawyer would have failed to\\n\\nobject to this testimony, its admission did not prejudice Anderson.\\n\\nAt trial, it was uncontested that Anderson shot Murr to death, that\\n\\nhe pursued him through the house while continuing to fire until the\\n\\ngun was empty, and that he had talked about killing Murr for\\n\\nmonths beforehand. Against that evidence, Anderson’s only defense\\n\\nwas that he was responding to Murr’s threats and insults. Given all\\n\\nthe jury heard about the brutality of the killing and about\\n\\nAnderson’s animus toward Murr, there is not a reasonable\\n\\nprobability that the outcome of the trial was affected by testimony\\n\\nthat Anderson once made a comment about rape to a coworker,\\n\\n                                  21\\n however unseemly or offensive it may have been. See Talley v. State,\\n\\n314 Ga. 153, 162-163 (3) (a) (875 SE2d 789) (2022) (defendant not\\n\\nprejudiced when counsel did not object to testimony about a threat\\n\\ndefendant had made, because while the threat “might have reflected\\n\\nnegatively on” the defendant, it was “not particularly disparaging of\\n\\n[his] character” when viewed in context and “given the strength of\\n\\nthe other admissible evidence against him”) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted); Gibbs v. State, 303 Ga. 681, 682-683 (1) (813\\n\\nSE2d 393) (2018) (defendant not prejudiced when counsel did not\\n\\nobject to testimony that arguably placed defendant’s character in\\n\\nissue, given strong evidence of defendant’s guilt). Because Anderson\\n\\ncannot show he suffered prejudice from this testimony, his claim of\\n\\nineffectiveness on this ground fails.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  22\\n '),\n",

STARSHIP ENTERPRISES OF ATLANTA, INC. v.\\n                 GWINNETT COUNTY.\\n\\n\\n       WARREN, Justice.\\n\\n       In October 2022, Starship Enterprises of Atlanta, Inc. filed its\\n\\nsecond lawsuit against Gwinnett County challenging a 2015\\n\\nGwinnett County ordinance regulating “Adult Establishments.” It\\n\\nfiled that suit under Article I, Section II, Paragraph V of Georgia’s\\n\\nConstitution (“Paragraph V”), which was added by amendment in\\n\\n2020 and waives sovereign immunity for certain lawsuits, including\\n\\nlawsuits against a county for declaratory judgment and related\\n\\ninjunctive relief. In March 2023, the trial court dismissed Starship’s\\n\\nlawsuit, holding that it was barred by sovereign immunity and by\\n\\nres judicata. Starship filed an appeal in the Court of Appeals, which\\n\\ntransferred the case to this Court on the ground that the case\\n involves the novel constitutional question of what counts as a “past,\\n\\ncurrent, or prospective act occurring after January 1, 2021” as used\\n\\nin Paragraph V. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that\\n\\nalthough the constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity contained\\n\\nin Paragraph V applies to Starship’s lawsuit, the suit is barred by\\n\\nres judicata. We therefore affirm the trial court’s order dismissing\\n\\nit. 1\\n\\n        1.   In January 2017, Starship, which owns two stores in\\n\\nGwinnett County, filed a lawsuit against Gwinnett County for\\n\\ndeclaratory judgment and an injunction, asking the trial court to\\n\\ndeclare certain parts of Gwinnett County Ordinance 2015-1082 (“the\\n\\nOrdinance”) unconstitutional. The Ordinance “amend[ed] Chapter\\n\\n18 of the Gwinnett County Code of Ordinances by repealing”\\n\\nordinances regarding “Adult Entertainment Establishments” and\\n\\nenacted a new article entitled “Adult Establishments.” As enacted\\n\\nby the Ordinance, Section 18-292 of the Gwinnett County Code of\\n\\nOrdinances defines “Adult Establishment” as including a “Sex\\n\\n\\n        1 The case was orally argued before this Court on March 19, 2024.\\n\\n                                       2\\n Paraphernalia Store,” and defines “Sex Paraphernalia Store” as:\\n\\n     a commercial establishment where more than 100 sexual\\n     devices are regularly made available for sale or rental.\\n     This definition shall not be construed to include any\\n     establishment located within an enclosed regional\\n     shopping mall or any pharmacy or establishment\\n     primarily dedicated to providing medical products.\\n\\nSection 18-293 (a) says that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to\\n\\noperate an adult establishment in the County without a valid adult\\n\\nestablishment license.”\\n\\n     As alleged in Starship’s complaint, the Gwinnett County\\n\\nDepartment of Planning and Development refused to renew\\n\\nStarship’s occupational tax certificate in February 2016, reasoning\\n\\nthat under the Ordinance, “Starship’s business was unlawful.” As a\\n\\nresult, Starship limited the number of “sexual devices” in each of its\\n\\nstores to 100. Gwinnett County sent inspectors to Starship’s stores\\n\\ntwice, and in July 2016, the County was satisfied that Starship had\\n\\ncomplied with the Ordinance and renewed the occupational tax\\n\\ncertificates for both stores.\\n\\n     In its 2017 complaint, Starship alleged that the Ordinance\\n\\n\\n                                  3\\n violates due process because several terms contained in the\\n\\nOrdinance, including “regularly made available for sale or rental,”\\n\\nare unconstitutionally vague; violates due-process privacy rights\\n\\nunder the Georgia Constitution by restricting the number of “sexual\\n\\ndevices” available for sale; violates Georgia constitutional due-\\n\\nprocess property and liberty rights by exempting certain merchants\\n\\nfrom the regulation; and violates Georgia equal-protection rights\\n\\nbecause the exemptions to the definition of “sex paraphernalia store”\\n\\nhave no rational relationship to the purpose of the Ordinance.\\n\\nGwinnett County filed a counterclaim for injunctive relief, alleging\\n\\nthat Starship had repeatedly violated County ordinances by\\n\\noperating     “sex   paraphernalia   stores”   without    an   adult\\n\\nestablishment license and in areas where “sex paraphernalia stores”\\n\\nare not permitted by the County zoning ordinances. The County\\n\\nrequested “a temporary restraining order, an interlocutory\\n\\ninjunction, and a permanent injunction” ordering Starship not to\\n\\nregularly make “more than 100 sexual devices . . . available for sale\\n\\nor rental.”\\n\\n                                 4\\n       In November 2017, after this Court decided Lathrop v. Deal,\\n\\n301 Ga. 408 (801 SE2d 867) (2017), Starship voluntarily dismissed\\n\\nits complaint without prejudice. See OCGA § 9-11-41 (a) (allowing\\n\\nfor a plaintiff to dismiss an action without prejudice “without order\\n\\nor permission of court”). 2 Gwinnett County, however, maintained\\n\\nits counterclaim, and moved for summary judgment. In January\\n\\n2018, the trial court granted Gwinnett County’s motion for summary\\n\\njudgment and injunction. The trial court held that Starship had\\n\\nroutinely violated the Ordinance and granted the County a\\n\\npermanent injunction restraining Starship from “regularly making\\n\\nmore than 100 sexual devices available for sale” at each of Starship’s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2   Lathrop held that “the doctrine of sovereign immunity extends\\ngenerally to suits against the State, its departments and agencies, and its\\nofficers in their official capacities for injunctive and declaratory relief from\\nofficial acts that are alleged to be unconstitutional.” Lathrop, 301 Ga. at 409.\\nLathrop also held that “the doctrine of sovereign immunity usually poses no\\nbar to suits in which state officers are sued in their individual capacities for\\nofficial acts that are alleged to be unconstitutional.” Id. at 434. In December\\n2017, Starship filed a second lawsuit arguing that the Ordinance is\\nunconstitutional, this time naming Gwinnett County commissioners in their\\nindividual capacities as the defendants. In January 2019, the trial court\\ngranted the County’s motion for summary judgment on the basis of legislative\\nimmunity.\\n                                       5\\n two Gwinnett County locations.3\\n\\n      Starship appealed the decision, arguing that Gwinnett County\\n\\nwas not entitled to a permanent injunction because the County had\\n\\nother remedies available. In a March 2019 unreported decision, the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s grant of a permanent\\n\\ninjunction against Starship, holding that “there was sufficient\\n\\nevidence for the trial court to conclude that without enjoining\\n\\nStarship, it would likely continue to habitually violate the law.”\\n\\n      In October 2022, Starship filed another lawsuit against\\n\\nGwinnett County—which is the subject of this appeal—alleging that\\n\\nthe Ordinance is unconstitutional in several respects and asking for\\n\\na declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. In this suit, Starship\\n\\ninvoked Paragraph V’s waiver of sovereign immunity. 4 Like the\\n\\n\\n      3 For purposes of this opinion, we will refer to this case as “Starship I.”\\n\\n\\n      4 Article I, Section II, Paragraph V (b) of Georgia’s Constitution says, in\\n\\nrelevant part:\\n      (l) Sovereign immunity is hereby waived for actions in the superior\\n      court seeking declaratory relief from acts of the state or any\\n      agency, authority, branch, board, bureau, commission,\\n      department, office, or public corporation of this state or officer or\\n      employee thereof or any county, consolidated government, or\\n\\n                                        6\\n complaint in Starship I, this complaint summarized the same facts\\n\\nabout the Ordinance and Starship’s efforts to reduce the number of\\n\\nsexual devices for sale in each of its stores to comply with the\\n\\nOrdinance; raised the same arguments as to due process and equal\\n\\nprotection; and further alleged that the Ordinance violates\\n\\nStarship’s free speech rights by curtailing the sale of sexual devices.5\\n\\n\\n     municipality of this state or officer or employee thereof outside the\\n     scope of lawful authority or in violation of the laws or the\\n     Constitution of this state or the Constitution of the United States.\\n     Sovereign immunity is further waived so that a court awarding\\n     declaratory relief pursuant to this Paragraph may, only after\\n     awarding declaratory relief, enjoin such acts to enforce its\\n     judgment. Such waiver of sovereign immunity under this\\n     Paragraph shall apply to past, current, and prospective acts which\\n     occur on or after January 1, 2021.\\n     (2) Actions filed pursuant to this Paragraph against this state or\\n     any agency, authority, branch, board, bureau, commission,\\n     department, office, or public corporation of this state or officer or\\n     employee thereof shall be brought exclusively against the state\\n     and in the name of the State of Georgia. Actions filed pursuant to\\n     this Paragraph against any county, consolidated government, or\\n     municipality of the state or officer or employee thereof shall be\\n     brought exclusively against such county, consolidated government,\\n     or municipality and in the name of such county, consolidated\\n     government, or municipality. Actions filed pursuant to this\\n     Paragraph naming as a defendant any individual, officer, or entity\\n     other than as expressly authorized under this Paragraph shall be\\n     dismissed.\\n\\n\\n     5  Specific allegations in the complaint will be further detailed as\\nnecessary in Division 2 (b) below.\\n                                      7\\n In December 2022, Gwinnett County moved to dismiss Starship’s\\n\\ncomplaint on the ground that it was barred by res judicata and\\n\\nsovereign immunity. In response, Starship argued that res judicata\\n\\ndid not apply because it dismissed its complaint in Starship I\\n\\nbecause it was barred by sovereign immunity, and that sovereign\\n\\nimmunity did not bar its new lawsuit because Paragraph V applies\\n\\nto “past, current, and prospective acts which occur on or after\\n\\nJanuary 1, 2021,” and the Ordinance would be enforced with\\n\\nprospective acts occurring after that date.\\n\\n     In March 2023, the trial court granted Gwinnett County’s\\n\\nmotion to dismiss. The court held that Starship’s claims were barred\\n\\nby res judicata, explaining:\\n\\n     [T]he claims that Starship alleges here are identical to\\n     claims it raised in Starship I, or that it could have put in\\n     issue in that case. . . . Whether Starship’s challenges to\\n     the Ordinance are characterized as affirmative defenses\\n     to, or compulsory counterclaims against, enforcement of\\n     the Ordinance, the time for Starship to assert those\\n     challenges was in Starship I.\\n\\nThe trial court also held that Starship’s claims were barred by\\n\\nsovereign immunity. The trial court explained that Paragraph V did\\n\\n                                  8\\n not apply in this case because it applies only “to past, current, and\\n\\nprospective acts which occur on or after January 1, 2021.” Ga.\\n\\nConst. of 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Par. V (b) (1). The trial court reasoned\\n\\nthat “[t]he Ordinance that Starship wants to challenge was adopted\\n\\nin 2015, so Starship’s cause of action against the Ordinance arose\\n\\nmany years before the waiver amendment passed.”                Starship\\n\\nappealed the trial court’s dismissal to the Court of Appeals, which\\n\\ntransferred the case to this Court because the threshold question of\\n\\nsovereign immunity and the construction of “past, current, and\\n\\nprospective acts” under Article I, Section II, Paragraph V (b) (1)\\n\\nposes a novel constitutional question.\\n\\n     2. Sovereign immunity, unlike res judicata, is a threshold\\n\\njurisdictional issue, so we address it first. See City of College Park\\n\\nv. Clayton County, 306 Ga. 301, 314 (830 SE2d 179) (2019) (“The\\n\\napplicability of sovereign immunity . . . is a jurisdictional issue.”).\\n\\nSee also Joyner v. Leaphart, 314 Ga. 1, 6 n.8 (875 SE2d 729) (2022)\\n\\n(indicating that res judicata is “an affirmative defense” and not “a\\n\\njurisdictional matter”). “The constitutional doctrine of sovereign\\n\\n                                   9\\n immunity bars any suit against the State to which it has not given\\n\\nits consent, . . . including suits for injunctive and declaratory relief\\n\\nfrom the enforcement of allegedly unconstitutional laws.” Lathrop,\\n\\n301 Ga. at 444. See also Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. I, Sec. II, Par. IX.\\n\\nWe have long held that sovereign immunity applies to counties. See\\n\\nLathrop, 301 Ga. at 421-422.\\n\\n     Sovereign immunity can be waived by statute or constitutional\\n\\namendment, however, and one such waiver was added to our\\n\\nConstitution when the people of Georgia ratified Act 596 (H.R. No.\\n\\n1023) in November 2020. As explained above, this waiver is codified\\n\\nin Article I, Section II, Paragraph V of Georgia’s Constitution and\\n\\nsays, in relevant part:\\n\\n           (b) (l) Sovereign immunity is hereby waived for\\n     actions in the superior court seeking declaratory relief\\n     from acts of the state or any agency, authority, branch,\\n     board, bureau, commission, department, office, or public\\n     corporation of this state or officer or employee thereof or\\n     any county, consolidated government, or municipality of\\n     this state or officer or employee thereof outside the scope\\n     of lawful authority or in violation of the laws or the\\n     Constitution of this state or the Constitution of the United\\n     States. Sovereign immunity is further waived so that a\\n     court awarding declaratory relief pursuant to this\\n\\n                                  10\\n      Paragraph may, only after awarding declaratory relief,\\n     enjoin such acts to enforce its judgment. Such waiver of\\n     sovereign immunity under this Paragraph shall apply to\\n     past, current, and prospective acts which occur on or after\\n     January 1, 2021.\\n\\nThere is no dispute that Starship’s lawsuit is the type of lawsuit that\\n\\nthis sovereign immunity waiver could apply to; it is an “action[] in\\n\\nthe superior court seeking declaratory relief from the acts of . . . [a]\\n\\ncounty” and seeking to “enjoin such acts.” Paragraph V (b) (1).6\\n\\n     The trial court held, and the County argues, that Paragraph V\\n\\ndoes not apply, however, because Starship’s lawsuit does not satisfy\\n\\nthe final sentence of Paragraph V (b) (1): it does not concern any\\n\\n“past, current, and prospective acts which occur on or after January\\n\\n1, 2021.” Specifically, the trial court held that Paragraph V did not\\n\\napply because the Ordinance was adopted in 2015, so “Starship’s\\n\\ncause of action against the Ordinance arose many years before the\\n\\nwaiver amendment passed.” The County, although agreeing with\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     6  There is also no dispute that Starship’s lawsuit, brought against\\nGwinnett County, satisfies the requirement in Article I, Section II, Paragraph\\nV (b) (2) that actions against a county must “be brought exclusively against\\nsuch county.”\\n                                     11\\n the trial court’s holding, offers a different reason that Paragraph V\\n\\ndoes not apply to Starship’s lawsuit. In this Court, the County\\n\\nconceded that acts of the County other than the passage of the\\n\\nOrdinance could be “acts” under Paragraph V, such as the County’s\\n\\ndenial of Starship’s occupational tax certificate in 2016. The County\\n\\nargues, however, that Starship has not met the requirement of\\n\\nParagraph V because it has failed to allege any act of the County—\\n\\nincluding any “prospective act”—that occurred after January 1, 2021\\n\\nfrom which Starship seeks relief.\\n\\n      For the reasons discussed below, we disagree with the trial\\n\\ncourt’s holding and with the County’s separate argument and\\n\\nconclude that Starship’s lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive\\n\\nrelief from “prospective acts” that will occur after January 1, 2021,\\n\\nand therefore Paragraph V’s sovereign immunity waiver applies.\\n\\n     (a) The trial court failed to recognize the breadth of the\\n     definition of “act” in Paragraph V.\\n\\n     The trial court’s holding that Paragraph V does not apply\\n\\nbecause the Ordinance was enacted in 2015 appears to be based on\\n\\n\\n                                 12\\n the notion that the only relevant “act” about which Starship could\\n\\ncomplain—at least for purposes of availing itself of the sovereign\\n\\nimmunity waiver in Paragraph V—was the County’s passage of the\\n\\nOrdinance. Putting aside whether the mere passage of an ordinance\\n\\nis the kind of “act” contemplated by the language of Paragraph V,7\\n\\nwe conclude that the word “act” as used in Paragraph V is not\\n\\nlimited to only such an action.\\n\\n     To be sure, Paragraph V does not define “act” or give examples\\n\\nof what constitutes an “act” under the paragraph. But dictionaries\\n\\nfrom around the time Paragraph V was enacted reveal that “act” can\\n\\nbe defined as “the doing of a thing,” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate\\n\\nDictionary (Merriam Webster 2020), at 12, and “a thing done; deed,”\\n\\nWebster’s New World College Dictionary (Houghton Mifflin\\n\\n\\n     7 We need not decide whether the mere passage of an ordinance is an\\n\\n“act” subject to Paragraph V’s waiver of sovereign immunity because there is\\nno question that the Ordinance was enacted well before the effective date of\\nthe waiver of sovereign immunity set out in Paragraph V, so any lawsuit that\\nchallenged the passage of the Ordinance itself could not take advantage of the\\nParagraph V waiver. Similarly, we need not decide whether and when a party\\nwould have standing to challenge the mere passage of an ordinance itself, as\\nopposed to, for example, the past or future enforcement of that ordinance\\nagainst the party. As we discuss below, Starship’s lawsuit here challenges the\\nenforcement of the Ordinance against Starship.\\n                                     13\\n Harcourt 2016), at 13. See also State v. SASS Group, LLC, 315 Ga.\\n\\n893, 898, 900 (885 SE2d 761) (2023) (interpreting Paragraph V and\\n\\nexplaining that when we interpret constitutional provisions, we\\n\\n“consider the ordinary meaning of the words as they appear in the\\n\\nConstitution” and “consider text in context”) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). That definition is consistent with the text of\\n\\nParagraph V, which contemplates lawsuits seeking relief from acts\\n\\nnot only of the state or county but also acts of, for example, “officer[s]\\n\\nor employee[s]” of a state “board, . . . office, or public corporation.”\\n\\nSee also Kuhlman v. State, 317 Ga. 232, 235 (892 SE2d 753) (2023)\\n\\n(holding that the appellant’s lawsuit for declaratory relief “comes\\n\\nwithin the constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity” in\\n\\nParagraph V, where a State board                denied      the appellant’s\\n\\napplication for relief from the prohibition on the possession of\\n\\nfirearms by convicted felons and the appellant sought declaratory\\n\\nrelief that this denial violated the laws of the state).8\\n\\n\\n     8 An alternate definition of “act” is “the formal product of a legislative\\n\\nbody.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam Webster 2020), at\\n\\n                                     14\\n       It follows that the trial court should have considered other\\n\\n“things” the County has “do[ne]” or could “do[],” see Merriam-\\n\\nWebster’s Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam Webster 2020), at 12,\\n\\nrelated to the Ordinance from which Starship could seek relief. For\\n\\nexample, denying Starship an occupational tax certificate was a\\n\\n“thing” the County did to enforce the Ordinance. See id. Thus, the\\n\\ntrial court erred by concluding that because the Ordinance was\\n\\npassed in 2015, Starship’s lawsuit did not qualify for a waiver of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12. Neither party argues that this is an appropriate definition of act as used\\nin Paragraph V (b) (1). Notably, even the trial court’s holding —although it\\nfocused on the year the Ordinance was passed—seemed to treat the passing of\\nthe Ordinance as the “act” at issue, as opposed to the Ordinance itself being\\nthe “act.” We agree that this alternate definition does not apply in interpreting\\nthe meaning of “act” in Paragraph V (b) (1). Not only does Paragraph V discuss\\nacts performed by entities that generally cannot pass laws or ordinances (such\\nas “officer[s] or employee[s]” of a state “board, . . . office, or public corporation),\\nbut the provision also talks about “acts which occur,” and generally laws or\\nordinances would be described as being “passed” or “enacted,” rather than\\n“occurring.” Other textual clues in Paragraph V support this interpretation:\\nlater in Paragraph V, when the provision uses “act” to refer to laws, it makes\\nthat clear by referencing the General Assembly and capitalizing “act.” See\\nParagraph V (b) (3) (“The General Assembly by an Act may limit . . .”);\\nParagraph V (b) (4) (“authorized by Act of the General Assembly”). See also,\\ne.g., SASS Group, 315 Ga. at 900 (explaining that our determination of the\\nmeaning of the exclusivity requirement in Paragraph V “is further confirmed\\nby the context of other language in Paragraph V and other parts of the same\\nsection of the Constitution”).\\n\\n                                          15\\n sovereign immunity under Paragraph V.9                 We now turn to the\\n\\n\\n\\n      9  In support of its conclusion, the trial court cited Donaldson v.\\nDepartment of Transportation, 262 Ga. 49 (414 SE2d 638) (1992); Brantley\\nCounty Development Partners, LLC v. Brantley County, 540 FSupp3d 1291\\n(S.D. Ga. 2021); and Crisp v. Georgia, 2022 WL 3589673 (11th Cir. Aug. 23,\\n2022). None of these cases is persuasive here.\\n      First, Donaldson—the only case from this Court the trial court cited—\\ndealt with a sovereign immunity provision different from Paragraph V, which\\nmeans the Court did not consider the meaning of “past, current, or prospective\\nacts,” but instead decided whether a 1991 amendment to the Georgia\\nConstitution that pertained to sovereign immunity, which was “silent on the\\nissue of retroactive application,” would be applied prospectively only. 262 Ga.\\nat 53. And the Court looked not at the date of any alleged wrongs done by the\\ngovernment, but at the date the lawsuit was filed: “Under Georgia law, the\\nwaiver of sovereign immunity occurs at the time that the action arises, not at\\nthe time that the negligent act was committed. We now hold that the state\\nmay withdraw its waiver of sovereign immunity at any time before a citizen\\nacts in reliance on that waiver by filing suit.” Donaldson, 262 Ga. at 53\\n(emphasis added). Thus, the Court concluded that the 1991 amendment did\\nnot apply to an action filed in 1988. See id. This conclusion has no application\\nto Paragraph V, the text of which makes the relevant sovereign-immunity\\nwaiver applicable based on when “acts of the State” or other applicable\\ngovernment entities occurred, not when the lawsuit was filed by the plaintiff.\\nFor this reason, we conclude that Donaldson has no bearing on our analysis of\\nParagraph V.\\n      In Brantley County, a federal district court purported to apply\\nDonaldson’s reasoning in interpreting Paragraph V, but—as we have just\\nexplained—the text of the constitutional amendment at issue in Donaldson\\nwas so dissimilar to the text of the 2020 amendment at issue in this case that\\nDonaldson’s reasoning is not the key to deciphering the meaning of Paragraph\\nV. See Brantley County, 540 FSupp3d at 1305 (citing Donaldson to determine\\nthat the waiver in Paragraph V did not apply in a case where the petitioners\\nfiled their lawsuit in September 2020, without considering whether the\\ncomplaint concerned any “prospective acts” that would occur after January 1,\\n2021). Moreover, even if we applied the reasoning of Donaldson and Brantley\\nCounty, we would conclude that Paragraph V (effective in January 2021) is\\napplicable to Starship’s lawsuit (filed in October 2022). Finally, Crisp provides\\n\\n                                       16\\n County’s argument that Starship has failed to allege that it seeks\\n\\nrelief from an “act” that happened after January 1, 2021.\\n\\n     (b) The County’s argument fails to acknowledge that Starship\\n     has alleged that it seeks relief from the County’s prospective acts\\n     of enforcement, which will occur after January 1, 2021.\\n\\n     In arguing that Starship has not alleged that it seeks relief\\n\\nfrom an act that occurred after January 1, 2021, the County points\\n\\nout that in its complaint, Starship alleges that the County\\n\\ncommitted several acts, such as passing the Ordinance and denying\\n\\nStarship’s occupational tax certificate, and all of these acts occurred\\n\\nbefore January 1, 2021. The County argues that these past acts are\\n\\nthe only ones we should consider when determining if Paragraph V\\n\\napplies because Starship has failed to allege any “prospective” acts—\\n\\ni.e. acts that will happen in the future—from which it seeks relief.\\n\\nWe disagree.\\n\\n     In its complaint, Starship alleged that Gwinnett County’s\\n\\n\\n\\nno guidance here because the government action at issue in that case related\\nto an allegedly unlawful arrest, and the court explained that “the challenged\\nacts all predate January 1, 2021.” See 2022 WL 3589673, at *3. Thus, it does\\nnot appear that the complaint in that case implicated any prospective acts,\\nwhereas, as discussed further below, Starship’s lawsuit here does.\\n                                     17\\n actions “have created a bonafide controversy between the parties,\\n\\nand Plaintiffs are in doubt as to their rights, privileges, and\\n\\nimmunities with respect to the enforcement of the licensing scheme\\n\\nat issue.”   Starship sought “a declaratory judgment declaring its\\n\\nrights, privileges, and immunities and injunctive relief enjoining\\n\\nDefendant from enforcing unconstitutional parts of its Ordinances.”\\n\\nThese statements demonstrate that in its lawsuit for declaratory\\n\\njudgment and an injunction, Starship sought relief not only from the\\n\\npassage of the 2015 Ordinance but also from the prospective\\n\\nenforcement of that Ordinance.\\n\\n     Specifically, in the portion of its complaint titled “Standing,”\\n\\nStarship alleges that it has “suffered injury-in-fact” by “having and\\n\\ncontinuing to suffer a curtailing of its right to sell lawful products.”\\n\\n(Emphasis added.) And the “Facts” portion of the complaint makes\\n\\nclear that Starship has changed its business practices to comply\\n\\nwith the Ordinance to be granted an occupational tax certificate. To\\n\\nthat end, Starship details how in 2016, after the County denied it an\\n\\noccupational tax certificate, Starship limited the number of sexual\\n\\n                                  18\\n devices available for sale in its stores so that it could comply with\\n\\nthe Ordinance, and how the County then sent inspectors to\\n\\nStarship’s stores on two occasions before eventually concluding that\\n\\nStarship was in compliance with the Ordinance.             Starship’s\\n\\ncomplaint asserts: “As a direct result of Defendant’s prohibition of\\n\\nhaving ‘available for sale’ no more than 100 sexual devises displayed\\n\\nor kept in stock,” Starship has “permanently removed” over 800\\n\\n“products” and over 1800 “items that were for sale prior to the\\n\\nenactment of [the] Ordinance” from each of its two stores. And “[t]he\\n\\nCounty’s actions have deprived, and will continue to deprive,\\n\\nStarship of property rights and liberty interests protected by the\\n\\nGeorgia Constitution.” (Emphasis added.)\\n\\n     As described above, Starship’s complaint demonstrates its\\n\\nconcern about prospective enforcement of the Ordinance: Starship\\n\\nhas stopped selling a significant number of sexual devices in\\n\\nresponse to the County’s enforcement of the Ordinance, and\\n\\nStarship alleges that it wants to (and believes it is constitutionally\\n\\nentitled to) resume selling more devices. It is this alleged concern\\n\\n                                 19\\n that animates Starship’s request for a declaratory judgment and\\n\\nrelated injunctive relief. And the County’s representations at oral\\n\\nargument before this Court validate that concern; the County\\n\\nacknowledged that it plans to continue enforcing the Ordinance.10\\n\\n     Because Starship sufficiently alleges in its complaint that\\n\\nStarship seeks to stop future enforcement of the Ordinance—and\\n\\nsuch an act of enforcement is a “prospective act[]” that will occur\\n\\nafter January 1, 2021—the County’s sovereign immunity is waived\\n\\nunder Paragraph V for Starship’s lawsuit, and the trial court erred\\n\\nby concluding otherwise.\\n\\n     3.   Starship’s complaint must still be dismissed, however,\\n\\nbecause it is barred by res judicata.         OCGA § 9-12-40 codifies\\n\\n“Georgia’s basic common law rule of res judicata.” Coen v. CDC\\n\\n\\n\\n     10 At oral argument, the County initially argued that any future acts of\\n\\nenforcement would be enforcement of the 2018 injunction that was granted to\\nthe County in Starship I requiring Starship to follow the Ordinance, and not\\nenforcement of the Ordinance itself. However, the County later conceded that\\nthe Ordinance was the basis for the injunction and that as long as the\\nOrdinance remained the law, the County has an obligation to enforce it. We\\ndo not decide here whether or how Starship could challenge the 2018\\ninjunction.\\n\\n                                    20\\n Software Corp., 304 Ga. 105, 107 (816 SE2d 670) (2018). OCGA § 9-\\n\\n12-40 says:\\n\\n     A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be\\n     conclusive between the same parties and their privies as\\n     to all matters put in issue or which under the rules of law\\n     might have been put in issue in the cause wherein the\\n     judgment was rendered until the judgment is reversed or\\n     set aside.\\n\\nFor res judicata to apply in Georgia, three requirements must be\\n\\nmet: “(1) identity of the cause of action, (2) identity of the parties or\\n\\ntheir privies, and (3) previous adjudication on the merits by a court\\n\\nof competent jurisdiction.” Coen, 304 Ga. at 105. There is no dispute\\n\\nthat the second requirement is met: in both Starship I and this case,\\n\\nthe parties are Starship and Gwinnett County. Thus, we consider\\n\\nwhether the first and third requirements have been met, beginning\\n\\nwith the third.\\n\\n     As to the third requirement, Starship does not argue that the\\n\\ntrial court was not a “court of competent jurisdiction,” but it argues\\n\\nthat there was no “adjudication on the merits” because Starship\\n\\nvoluntarily dismissed its lawsuit in Starship I, and a first voluntary\\n\\n\\n                                   21\\n dismissal does not constitute an adjudication on the merits.\\n\\nStarship is correct that there was no adjudication of the merits of its\\n\\nlawsuit against the County in Starship I. See OCGA § 9-11-41 (a)\\n\\n(3) (stating that only a second notice of dismissal under that\\n\\nsubsection “operates as an adjudication upon the merits”).11\\n\\n\\n      11 In Starship I, the trial court actually did rule on some of Starship’s\\n\\nconstitutional claims, holding that the phrase “available for sale” is not\\nunconstitutionally vague and that the County can “constitutionally regulate\\nstand-alone adult stores differently than stores in a regional shopping mall.”\\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeals, however, Starship argued that the trial\\ncourt erred by addressing these constitutional matters because they were\\nraised in Starship’s dismissed claim against the County. (In oral argument\\nbefore this Court, Starship’s counsel similarly argued that he did not raise the\\nconstitutional matters in defending against the counterclaim. Although\\ncounsel acknowledged that he “talked about” constitutional considerations\\nduring the hearing on the County’s counterclaim in Starship I, he asserted that\\nhe did not make a “complete presentation” of the constitutional matters. This\\nCourt does not have the record of the hearing in Starship I before us in this\\ncase.) The Court of Appeals agreed with Starship’s assertion that the\\nconstitutional matters were raised only as part of the dismissed claim and\\nreversed the trial court’s holdings as to the constitutional matters on the\\nground that the trial court erred by addressing claims Starship raised in its\\ndismissed complaint: “Assuming, arguendo, that Starship argued the merits of\\nsome of its constitutional claims during the hearing, the trial court had no\\npower to reinstate the dismissed action and adjudicate any of Starship’s\\ndismissed claims. Consequently, the trial court’s entry of summary judgment\\non Starship’s constitutional claims was improper, and we reverse the trial\\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment as to those claims.”\\n      In light of this unique situation—where Starship has argued that it did\\nnot raise the constitutional matters in defending against the County’s\\ncounterclaim and the Court of Appeals concluded that the constitutional\\nmatters were raised only as part of Starship’s dismissed lawsuit and reversed\\n\\n                                      22\\n However, not every claim in Starship I was dismissed; the County\\n\\ncontinued to assert its counterclaim, and that lawsuit was\\n\\nadjudicated on the merits. And the preclusive effect of res judicata\\n\\napplies not only to matters that were “put in issue” but also those\\n\\nthat “might have been put in issue.” OCGA § 9-12-40 (emphasis\\n\\nadded). Because, as we explain further below, Starship could have\\n\\nraised the constitutional matters in this counterclaim that was\\n\\nadjudicated on the merits, the third requirement of res judicata is\\n\\nmet. See OCGA § 9-12-42 (“For a former judgment to be a bar to\\n\\nsubsequent action, the merits of the case must have been\\n\\nadjudicated.”) (emphasis added).\\n\\n      As to the final requirement of res judicata—“identity of the\\n\\ncause of action”—we have explained that “cause of action” in this\\n\\ncontext means “the entire set of facts which give rise to an\\n\\n\\n\\nthe trial court’s ruling on the constitutional issues—and because the\\ncorrectness of the Court of Appeals’s Starship I holding is not at issue in this\\ncase, we will treat these constitutional matters as not having been raised in\\nStarship I. We also note that the Court of Appeals’s holding that the trial court\\nhad “no power” to rule on dismissed claims has no bearing on whether the trial\\ncourt could have ruled on the constitutional matters if Starship had raised\\nthem in defending against the County’s counterclaim.\\n                                       23\\n enforceable claim.” Coen, 304 Ga. at 105. “In considering the ‘entire\\n\\nset of facts,’ we focus on the ‘wrong’ that is asserted.” Id.\\n\\n     This Court has explained that the requirement of identity of\\n\\nthe cause of action is met “[s]o long as a party pleads but one wrong\\n\\nin respect to the same transaction, . . . and it makes no difference\\n\\nthat the remedy sought to be applied under different procedures\\n\\ngrowing out of the same wrong may be different.” McCracken v. City\\n\\nof College Park, 259 Ga. 490, 491 (1989). For example, in the first\\n\\ncase at issue in McCracken, the city revoked McCracken’s liquor\\n\\nlicense based on her violation of a city ordinance, McCracken filed a\\n\\nwrit of certiorari to the superior court to appeal that judgment, and\\n\\nthe superior court dismissed the writ and affirmed the judgment.\\n\\nSee id. McCracken then filed a separate action for an injunction and\\n\\ndamages sustained as a result of the enforcement of the same\\n\\nordinance. See id. at 490. The trial court granted summary\\n\\njudgment to the city on the ground that McCracken’s suit was barred\\n\\nby res judicata, and this Court affirmed, explaining that in both\\n\\ncases “only one wrong is complaint of, namely, the enforcement of an\\n\\n                                   24\\n allegedly     unconstitutional       ordinance,”      and     “[t]he   principal\\n\\ndifference between the two actions is the nature of the relief sought,”\\n\\nwhich we held did not defeat res judicata. Id. at 491. See also\\n\\nWaggaman v. Franklin Life Ins. Co., 265 Ga. 565, 565-566 (458 SE2d\\n\\n826) (1995) (holding that because Waggaman had the opportunity to\\n\\nlitigate the ownership of his life insurance policy in an earlier\\n\\ndivorce action, res judicata barred him from filing a later action\\n\\nagainst the insurance company and his ex-wife for a declaratory\\n\\njudgment that he owned the policy). 12\\n\\n      Here, as in McCracken, the “wrong” at issue for Starship in\\n\\nboth cases is the same: the County’s enforcement of the allegedly\\n\\n\\n\\n      12 We note that Body of Christ Overcoming Church of God v. Brinson, 287\\n\\nGa. 485 (696 SE2d 667) (2010), held, with no clear analysis, that a quiet-title\\naction and a declaratory judgment action did not have “an identity of causes of\\naction.” See id. at 487. To the extent that case could be read to indicate that\\nres judicata did not apply simply because different relief was sought, it was\\ninconstant with McCracken, a case it did not acknowledge. More importantly,\\nto the extent Body of Christ failed to consider the “entire set of facts which give\\nrise” to the claim as the touchstone for whether the cases shared an identity of\\ncauses of action, it was implicitly overruled by Coen. See Coen, 304 Ga. at 105.\\nThus, Body of Christ does not prevent our application of res judicata in this\\ncase. See Caldwell v. State, 313 Ga. 640, 644 (872 SE2d 712) (2022) (explaining\\nthat this Court is not bound by cases that have been implicitly overruled, and\\nwe generally follow the decision in the most recent case).\\n\\n                                        25\\n unconstitutional Ordinance.     See McCracken, 259 Ga. at 491.\\n\\nAnd the “entire set of facts” at issue in both the County’s\\n\\ncounterclaim for an injunction in Starship I and in Starship’s\\n\\ncurrent lawsuit are the same: both cases concern the County’s\\n\\nenforcement of the Ordinance against Starship and what Starship\\n\\nhas done to come into compliance.       See Coen, 304 Ga. at 105\\n\\n(explaining that in determining if the “cause of action” is the same,\\n\\nwe look at “the entire set of facts which give rise to an enforceable\\n\\nclaim”). And because the “wrong” and “entire set of facts” raised\\n\\nhere are the same as those implicated in Starship I, the\\n\\nconstitutional matters Starship raises here could have been raised\\n\\nin Starship I: although Starship voluntarily dismissed its claims, it\\n\\nstill could have raised the relevant constitutional matters in\\n\\nresponse to the County’s counterclaim, which the County pursued\\n\\neven after Starship dismissed its claims.       In other words: in\\n\\ndefending against the County’s claim that it was entitled to an\\n\\ninjunction enforcing the Ordinance against Starship, Starship could\\n\\nhave argued that it should not be forced to comply with the\\n\\n                                 26\\n Ordinance because the Ordinance was unconstitutional—which\\n\\nwould have “put in issue” in Starship I the constitutional matters\\n\\nthat are now at issue on appeal after Starship filed this lawsuit\\n\\nbased on the same wrong. See OCGA § 9-12-40.13\\n\\n     Because the requirements of res judicata are met and the\\n\\nconstitutional matters Starship now seeks to raise “might have been\\n\\nput in issue” in Starship I, Starship’s lawsuit is barred by res\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     13 Although, as quoted in Division I above, the trial court in this case\\n\\nindicated that Starship’s constitutional claims could be characterized as a\\n“compulsory counterclaim,” Starship actually could not have raised its\\nconstitutional claims affirmatively in Starship I in a claim or counterclaim\\nagainst the County because such claims were barred by sovereign immunity at\\nthat time. See Lathrop, 301 Ga. at 444. See also Heiskell v. Roberts, 295 Ga.\\n795, 801 (764 SE2d 368) (2014) (“A ‘counterclaim’ is simply the way that a\\ndefendant brings a “claim” against the plaintiff in an existing lawsuit. OCGA\\n§ 9-11-13(a), (b). Such claims do not avoid immunity defenses because they are\\nlabeled ‘counterclaims.’ See OCGA § 9-11-13 (d); Dept. of Human Resources v.\\nMoney, 222 Ga. App. 149, 149, 473 SE2d 200 (1996) (applying sovereign\\nimmunity to counterclaims).”). However, sovereign immunity did not bar\\nStarship from raising its claims that the Ordinance is unconstitutional in\\ndefending against the County’s lawsuit against Starship for an injunction\\nenforcing the Ordinance. See Lathrop, 301 Ga. at 425 (“[T]he doctrine of\\nsovereign immunity bars suits against the State to which the State has not\\nconsented.”) (emphasis added). See also Piedmont Cotton Mills, Inc. v.\\nWoelper, 269 Ga. 109, 110 (1998) (“[I]t is only where the merits were not and\\ncould not have been determined under a proper presentation and management\\nof the case that res judicata is not a viable defense.

ISAAC v. THE STATE.\\n\\n       MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Kenneth Maurice Isaac was convicted of malice\\n\\nmurder, among other crimes, for the shooting death of Reginald\\n\\nRoberts.1 On appeal, Isaac claims that his trial counsel rendered\\n\\nineffective assistance by refusing to allow him to testify in his own\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 Roberts was shot and killed on the night of April 19, 2014. On August\\n\\n30, 2016, Isaac was indicted on five counts in relation to the shooting: (1) malice\\nmurder; (2) felony murder predicated on aggravated assault; (3) aggravated\\nassault; (4) possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony; and (5)\\nviolation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act. A jury trial took\\nplace October 3-7, and October 11, 2016, and the jury found Isaac guilty of all\\ncounts. On October 20, 2016, the trial court sentenced him to life in prison with\\nthe possibility of parole for malice murder (Count 1), five years in prison\\nconsecutive to Count 1 for the possession offense (Count 4), and ten years\\nconsecutive to Count 4 for the street gang offense (Count 5). The felony murder\\ncount (Count 2) was vacated by operation of law, and the aggravated assault\\ncount (Count 3) merged into malice murder. On October 26, 2016, Isaac filed a\\nmotion for new trial, which he amended on September 26, 2022. The trial court\\nheld a hearing on that motion on October 4, 2022, and denied it by order dated\\nNovember 1, 2022. On November 28, 2022, Isaac timely filed a notice of appeal,\\nwhich he amended on November 29 and again on June 14, 2023. This case was\\ndocketed to the term of court beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a\\ndecision on the briefs.\\n defense and that the trial court erred by declining to instruct the\\n\\njury on impeachment of a witness through bias toward a party. For\\n\\nthe reasons that follow, his claims fail, so we affirm.\\n\\n     1. The evidence at trial showed the following. On April 20,\\n\\n2014, Roberts was found dead, nude from the waist down, in a\\n\\nwooded area connecting two apartment complexes, Kensington\\n\\nManor and Southern Pines.\\n\\n     The previous day, April 19, Roberts and two others stole\\n\\nvehicles from an airport, including a newer-model, black Ford\\n\\nMustang. According to his girlfriend Keneisha Williams, Roberts\\n\\nreturned home that afternoon, and then left in the evening to\\n\\nexchange a silver gun in his possession for a black gun. Williams\\n\\ntestified that in the days leading up to that evening, Roberts had\\n\\ntried to exchange his silver gun by meeting with “someone named\\n\\nChad.” Williams did not know who “Chad” was, but recounted from\\n\\nher conversations with Roberts that “Chad” lived with his aunt, and\\n\\nthat before April 19, Roberts had gone to the aunt’s apartment to\\n\\nfind “Chad” but did not find him there. After Roberts left on the\\n\\n                                   2\\n evening of April 19, Williams did not see him again.\\n\\n     That evening, Kenyatte Stephenson, a resident of Kensington\\n\\nManor, saw Roberts near her apartment talking with a man for\\n\\nabout twenty minutes and appearing “mad.” In the days prior to\\n\\nApril 19, Roberts had called Stephenson a number of times looking\\n\\nfor Isaac. The same evening, Stephenson also saw Isaac, whom she\\n\\nhad known for a year by then, at her apartment. Isaac had a black\\n\\ngun that evening, and he left between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. to go to his\\n\\naunt’s house in Southern Pines. Stephenson heard two gun shots\\n\\nthat night, though she did not know what time she heard the shots.\\n\\n     The same night, Tiffany Farley, a resident of Southern Pines\\n\\nwho had known Isaac for years, went with Isaac’s girlfriend to a local\\n\\nbar. According to Farley, at about 11:30 p.m. or midnight, she saw\\n\\nIsaac at the bar, and he told her: “I got a body, and he is naked from\\n\\nthe waist down in the cut” and “[y]ou will see, just wait until in the\\n\\nmorning.” At trial, Farley described the “cut” as an area that people\\n\\ntraversed to go between Kensington Manor and Southern Pines.\\n\\n     The next day, April 20, Isaac attended a cookout with family\\n\\n                                  3\\n and friends, including his cousin Sequoia Isaac2 and her brother\\n\\nKenyara Bolton. According to Sequoia, Isaac told her at the cookout\\n\\nthat he had shot Roberts twice in the head. Sequoia also saw Isaac\\n\\n“near” and “go into” a newer-model black Mustang. Bolton also saw\\n\\nIsaac standing next to a newer “black or gray” Mustang.\\n\\n      That same day, Quantavious Hurt, a teenager who often\\n\\nvisited Kensington Manor and Southern Pines, discovered Roberts’s\\n\\nbody, buttocks exposed, in the “cut” between the two apartment\\n\\ncomplexes, and notified police. Hurt testified that in the days\\n\\nleading up to the discovery, Roberts had come to the apartments\\n\\nlooking for Isaac and thought Isaac had his gun; Roberts went to\\n\\nIsaac’s aunt’s home and asked her about the gun. About three or four\\n\\ndays after he found Roberts dead, Hurt also saw Isaac in a “purplish\\n\\nblackish” Mustang.\\n\\n      After Hurt notified police, law enforcement responded to the\\n\\ncrime scene. Richard Bowen, a forensic death investigator, found a\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Since Sequoia and Isaac have the same surname, we refer to Sequoia\\n\\nby only her first name.\\n                                    4\\n gunshot wound in Roberts’s neck. Based in part on the undisturbed\\n\\ndirt near Roberts’s body, Bowen concluded that Roberts was nude\\n\\nfrom the waist down when he was shot and that right after getting\\n\\nshot, he fell where he was later found. Dr. Gerald Thomas Gowitt,\\n\\nthe medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Roberts, also\\n\\nnoted the gunshot wound on the right side of his neck, and concluded\\n\\nthat the bullet path was “right to left, front to back, and slightly\\n\\ndownward” and that whoever had shot Roberts “couldn’t have been\\n\\nbehind him.”\\n\\n     On May 4, 2014, law enforcement found the black Ford\\n\\nMustang that Roberts had stolen. None of the latent prints they\\n\\nfound on the car matched Isaac’s fingerprints, but Dr. Torry\\n\\nPassmore, the expert in fingerprint examination and analysis who\\n\\nhad compared Isaac’s fingerprints with those on the car, testified\\n\\nthat fingerprints on a car could be wiped or washed down. Another\\n\\nlaw enforcement officer also indicated that he and those who towed\\n\\nthe car had to have touched it, that the location where he had found\\n\\nthe car was “out in the elements,” and that “it rain[ed] when the car\\n\\n                                 5\\n had gotten wet.”\\n\\n      Also that May, law enforcement arrested and interviewed\\n\\nIsaac. The audio recordings of two interviews were admitted at trial\\n\\nand played for the jury. In the first interview, conducted on May 24,\\n\\nIsaac told police that at the time of Roberts’s shooting, he was in\\n\\nFlorida. But in the second interview, conducted on May 29, Isaac\\n\\ntold police that on April 19, he went to the “cut” with Sequoia’s\\n\\nboyfriend, Kenyatta Frazier, 3 and saw Frazier come out directly\\n\\nbehind Roberts and fire at Roberts three times. In that interview,\\n\\nIsaac stated he had never been in a black Mustang.\\n\\n      Isaac also told police that he was a leader in the Bloods gang\\n\\nwith about 170 members under him and indicated that he could\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 At trial, Isaac’s counsel suggested that Frazier and not Isaac killed\\n\\nRoberts, by drawing attention to evidence that: (1) Frazier told police that he\\nhad been upset with Roberts for stealing and selling his property and that he\\nthought Roberts was becoming a “greedy man”; (2) Roberts, according to his\\ngirlfriend Williams, wanted to sell Frazier’s gun since Frazier had sold\\nRoberts’s cars in the past; and (3) Williams told police that Frazier was the one\\nwho called Roberts on April 19 shortly before Roberts left home. Isaac’s trial\\ncounsel also suggested when cross-examining a detective who had interviewed\\nFrazier, that Frazier and Sequoia’s romantic relationship influenced Sequoia’s\\nstatements to police about Isaac.\\n\\n                                       6\\n order members to handle those who disrespected him. At trial,\\n\\nInvestigator   Wayne    Pinckney,    an   expert   in   street   gang\\n\\ninvestigations, testified that gang leaders maintain their leadership\\n\\nby commanding respect: gangs always respond to a “disrespectful\\n\\nsituation,” and members often talk about their crimes to instill fear\\n\\nand command an area. Investigator Pinckney testified that those\\n\\nwho violate a gang’s norms can be “discipline[d]” even by murder,\\n\\nand recalled Isaac speaking to him about being “in charge of” people\\n\\nwho committed violations. Hurt, the teenager who had found\\n\\nRoberts’s body—and who had spent time with Isaac and had often\\n\\nvisited Kensington Manor and Southern Pines, sites for gang\\n\\nactivity—testified that it was “kind of a violation” for Roberts to\\n\\nhave asked Isaac’s aunt about a gun, because, in Hurt’s words, “you\\n\\ndon’t never actually go to somebody’s house or any person house and\\n\\nsay something about the gun or anything because that kind of could\\n\\nspook them or scare them[.]”\\n\\n     Having seen situations where criminals ordered victims to\\n\\nstrip at gunpoint to humiliate them, Investigator Pinckney believed\\n\\n                                 7\\n that whoever killed Roberts likely sought to humiliate him and send\\n\\na message, because Roberts was found naked from the waist down\\n\\nin a frequently used area and without signs of sexual abuse.\\n\\n     2. Isaac claims his trial counsel provided constitutionally\\n\\nineffective assistance by preventing him from testifying. The record\\n\\nshows that after the State rested, the trial court told Isaac that he\\n\\nneeded to decide whether to testify and took a ten-minute recess to\\n\\ngive Isaac the chance to confer with his trial counsel on whether to\\n\\ntestify. After the recess, counsel announced that she “had the\\n\\nopportunity to speak with” Isaac, and Isaac himself announced that\\n\\nhe was not going to testify. The defense then presented its case and\\n\\nrested after calling two witnesses. However, at the motion for new\\n\\ntrial hearing, counsel and Isaac each testified that after the defense\\n\\npresented its last witness and right before the defense rested, Isaac\\n\\ntold counsel he wanted to testify and she told him “no.” Isaac\\n\\nindicated that this exchange also occurred in the ten-minute recess\\n\\nright after the State rested. The trial court, in its order denying\\n\\nIsaac’s motion for new trial, “decline[d] to credit the testimony of\\n\\n                                  8\\n [Isaac] or trial counsel” and stated that “[n]othing in the record\\n\\nindicates [Isaac] ever expressed any desire to testify.” Yet on appeal,\\n\\nIsaac maintains that he expressed to counsel a desire to testify and\\n\\nshe told him “no,” and that by doing so, she provided constitutionally\\n\\nineffective assistance.\\n\\n     To succeed on his ineffective assistance claim, Isaac must show\\n\\nthat his trial counsel performed deficiently and that the deficiency\\n\\nprejudiced the defense. See Strickland v. Washington, \\n466 U.S. 668\\n,\\n\\n687 (III) (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984). To show deficiency,\\n\\nIsaac must show that counsel “performed [her] duties in an\\n\\nobjectively unreasonable way, considering all the circumstances and\\n\\nin the light of prevailing professional norms.” Evans v. State, \\n315\\n\\nGa. 607\\n, 611 (2) (b) (\\n884 SE2d 334\\n) (2023). To show prejudice, Isaac\\n\\n“must establish a reasonable probability that, in the absence of\\n\\ncounsel’s deficient performance, the result of the trial would have\\n\\nbeen different.” Rashad v. State, \\n318 Ga. 199\\n, 208 (3) (\\n897 SE2d 760\\n)\\n\\n(2024) (citation and punctuation omitted). “If [Isaac] fails to make a\\n\\nsufficient showing on one part of the Strickland test, we need not\\n\\n                                  9\\n address the other part.” Washington v. State, \\n313 Ga. 771\\n, 773 (3)\\n\\n(\\n873 SE2d 132\\n) (2022).\\n\\n     Isaac argues that counsel performed deficiently by telling him\\n\\n“no” after he asked to testify, because by doing so she thwarted the\\n\\nexercise of his constitutional rights. See Thomas v. State, \\n314 Ga.\\n\\n681\\n, 690 (2) (\\n878 SE2d 493\\n) (2022) (“If a defendant decides to testify,\\n\\ncounsel must accept that decision and call him to the stand”); Mobley\\n\\nv. State, \\n264 Ga. 854\\n, 856 (2) (\\n452 SE2d 500\\n) (1995) (“[A] criminal\\n\\ndefendant has a constitutional right, based on Fifth and Sixth\\n\\nAmendment guarantees and due process considerations, to testify in\\n\\nhis . . . own defense”). Isaac argues that we should presume counsel’s\\n\\nrefusal to let him testify prejudiced him because that refusal\\n\\namounted to a “constructive denial of counsel,” see Turpin v. Curtis,\\n\\n278 Ga. 698\\n, 699 (1) (\\n606 SE2d 244\\n) (2004), and that even if we do\\n\\nnot presume prejudice, Isaac has met his burden of showing\\n\\nprejudice under Strickland. The State, in turn, suggests that the\\n\\ntrial court, in its order denying Isaac’s motion for new trial,\\n\\nimplicitly made a finding that Isaac never even expressed a desire\\n\\n                                  10\\n to testify, so we should accept this finding by the trial court unless\\n\\nit is clearly erroneous. See Wright v. State, \\n291 Ga. 869\\n, 870 (2) (\\n734\\n\\nSE2d 876\\n) (2012).\\n\\n      Assuming that Isaac asked counsel to testify and counsel told\\n\\nhim “no,” 4 and that counsel performed deficiently by doing so, we\\n\\nconclude that Isaac failed to show that his counsel provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance.\\n\\n      (a) Isaac first argues that rather than require him to show\\n\\nprejudice under Strickland, we should presume prejudice because\\n\\nthis case falls into the “constructive denial of counsel” exception to\\n\\nStrickland that we described in Turpin, \\n278 Ga. at 699\\n (1)\\n\\n(identifying “constructive denial of counsel” as one of the “narrow\\n\\nrange of circumstances” where we “apply a presumption” of\\n\\nprejudice “in evaluating the prejudice component of a claim of\\n\\nineffective assistance”). This exception, we have held, applies “only\\n\\nwhen there [is] a breakdown in the adversarial process, such that\\n\\n\\n      4 Since we resolve Isaac’s ineffective assistance claim on prejudice, we\\n\\nneed not decide whether the trial court made a factual finding that Isaac never\\nexpressed a desire to testify or whether such a finding is clearly erroneous.\\n                                      11\\n counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution’s case to meaningful\\n\\nadversarial testing.” Wainwright v. State, \\n305 Ga. 63\\n, 68 (3) (\\n823\\n\\nSE2d 749\\n) (2019). 5 And, we have held, for this exception to apply,\\n\\ncounsel’s failure must be “complete” and “occur throughout the\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 Two cases decided by the United States Supreme Court form the legal\\n\\nbackground of the “constructive denial of counsel” exception to Strickland’s\\nrequirements. The first case is Strickland itself, which discussed “constructive\\ndenial of counsel” as an exception to its requirement that a defendant show\\nprejudice to succeed on an ineffective assistance claim. As the Strickland Court\\nexplained, “[i]n certain Sixth Amendment contexts, prejudice is presumed.\\nActual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether is legally\\npresumed to result in prejudice. . . . Prejudice in these circumstances is so\\nlikely that case-by-case inquiry into prejudice is not worth the cost.” \\n466 U.S.\\nat 692\\n (III) (B). The second case is United States v. Cronic, where the Court\\nsimilarly discussed, in the context of the Sixth Amendment right to assistance\\nof counsel, “circumstances . . . so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of\\nlitigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.” See \\n466 U.S. 648\\n, 658\\n(III) (104 SCt 2039, 80 LE2d 657) (1984). Those circumstances, the Court\\nexplained, include when there is a “complete denial of counsel” (e.g., counsel is\\n“totally absent”), or, when “counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution’s\\ncase to meaningful adversarial testing.” See \\nid. at 658-59\\n (III) & n. 25.\\n       Reading Strickland and Cronic together, we have held that “Cronic’s\\n‘constructive denial of counsel’ exception to the general Strickland standard is\\na narrow one that applies only when there [is] a breakdown in the adversarial\\nprocess, such that counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution’s case to\\nmeaningful adversarial testing.” Wainwright, \\n305 Ga. at 68\\n (3) (citation and\\npunctuation omitted); Turpin, \\n278 Ga. at 699\\n (1); State v. Heath, \\n277 Ga. 337\\n,\\n338-39 (\\n588 SE2d 738\\n) (2003). In addition, we have held, “the Cronic\\n[constructive denial of counsel] exception requires an attorney’s failure to be\\ncomplete and [ ] occur throughout the proceeding and not merely at specific\\npoints.” Wainwright, 305 at 68 (3) (citation and punctuation omitted). See\\nTepanca v. State, \\n297 Ga. 47\\n, 50-51 (6) (\\n771 SE2d 879\\n) (2015) (citation and\\npunctuation omitted); Turpin, \\n278 Ga. at 699\\n (1).\\n\\n                                        12\\n proceeding and not merely at specific points.” \\nId.\\n (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted); Turpin, \\n278 Ga. at 699\\n (1). Isaac argues that\\n\\nby preventing him from testifying, counsel failed to subject the\\n\\nState’s case to “meaningful adversarial testing,” Wainwright, \\n305\\n\\nGa. at 68\\n (3) (citation and punctuation omitted), because the State\\n\\nrelied primarily on Sequoia’s and Farley’s testimony that Isaac had\\n\\nconfided in them about the murder, and had he testified, he would\\n\\nhave rebutted their testimony.\\n\\n     But as we stated in Turpin—which Isaac cites and does not ask\\n\\nus to overrule—“Georgia appellate courts have consistently required\\n\\nthat, where a defendant alleges that counsel rendered ineffective\\n\\nassistance by preventing him from testifying, he must show that this\\n\\naction actually prejudiced his defense.” \\n278 Ga. at 700\\n (1) (emphasis\\n\\nadded; citing cases from this Court and federal courts to support this\\n\\nproposition and stating “Georgia law in this regard is consistent\\n\\nwith the overwhelming weight of federal and state authority”). Isaac\\n\\ndoes not point us to any authority, nor have we found any, in which\\n\\ncounsel’s failure to allow a defendant to testify amounts by itself to\\n\\n                                 13\\n the kind of constructive denial of counsel described in Turpin. 6 Thus,\\n\\nwe do not presume prejudice based on the constructive-denial-of-\\n\\nprejudice exception to Strickland but instead assess whether Isaac\\n\\nshowed prejudice under Strickland. See Turpin, \\n278 Ga. at 700\\n (1),\\n\\n701 (2) (after declining to presume prejudice, assessing whether\\n\\ndefendant showed prejudice under Strickland).\\n\\n      (b) We conclude that Isaac failed to show Strickland prejudice.\\n\\nTo begin, Isaac was never asked at the motion for new trial hearing\\n\\nwhat he would have specifically testified had he gotten on the stand.\\n\\nSee Bell v. State, \\n287 Ga. 670\\n, 675 (3) (\\n697 SE2d 793\\n) (2010)\\n\\n(defendant did not show prejudice from trial counsel’s failure to call\\n\\ntwo witnesses who allegedly could have offered exculpatory\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 In any event, Isaac fails to show that by denying his requests to testify,\\n\\ncounsel “entirely” failed to subject the State’s case to meaningful adversarial\\ntesting and that the failure was “not merely at specific points.” See\\nWainwright, \\n305 Ga. at 68\\n (3) (citation and punctuation omitted). Even without\\ncalling Isaac to testify, counsel, throughout the trial, cross-examined the\\nState’s witnesses, including Sequoia and Farley; direct-examined defense\\nwitnesses; and objected a multitude of times. See Burrell v. State, \\n301 Ga. 21\\n,\\n23 (2) (\\n799 SE2d 181\\n) (2017) (appellant’s allegations that counsel was\\nineffective at “specific points of his trial” such as by failing to object at several\\nmoments, did not meet Cronic’s “stringent standard” for presumptive\\nprejudice).\\n                                         14\\n evidence, in part because defendant “offered only speculation as to\\n\\nthe possible testimony of one of the witnesses, and did not offer even\\n\\nspeculation about the possible testimony of the other witness”).\\n\\nHowever, Isaac was asked questions about the shooting, and he\\n\\ndenied shooting Roberts, telling Farley that “I got a body,” or telling\\n\\nSequoia that he had shot someone. Isaac also testified that Frazier\\n\\nand Roberts had “beef” between each other, and suggested that\\n\\nSequoia lacked credibility because Frazier was the father of her\\n\\nchildren.\\n\\n     Even if we assume that Isaac would have testified at trial along\\n\\nthe lines that he testified at the motion for new trial hearing, there\\n\\nis not a “reasonable probability” that “the result of the proceeding\\n\\nwould have been different.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694 (III) (B). See\\n\\nid. (“A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\\n\\nconfidence in the outcome.”).\\n\\n     First, the evidence of Isaac’s guilt is strong. Sequoia testified\\n\\nthat Isaac told her he had shot Roberts twice in the head. Farley\\n\\nrecounted that Isaac had told her the night of Roberts’s shooting, “I\\n\\n                                  15\\n got a body, and he is naked from the waist down in the cut.” Roberts\\n\\nstole a black Mustang shortly before his death, and after his death,\\n\\nat least three people including a defense witness spotted Isaac near\\n\\nor “go into” a black or dark-colored Mustang, while Isaac told police\\n\\nhe had never been in a black Mustang. In addition, Isaac told\\n\\nconflicting stories after his arrest. In his first interview, Isaac told\\n\\npolice that he was in Florida at the time of Roberts’s shooting; this\\n\\ncontradicted not only his second interview but also Farley and\\n\\nStephenson’s recollection of seeing Isaac on the night of April 19.\\n\\nAlso, Isaac’s account of seeing Frazier shoot Roberts from behind\\n\\ncontradicted expert testimony that the shooter could not have shot\\n\\nRoberts from behind. And, no witness testified at trial to seeing\\n\\nFrazier near the crime scene on the night of April 19.\\n\\n     Second, even if Isaac testified at trial, as he did at the motion\\n\\nfor new trial hearing, about Frazier’s relationship with Sequoia and\\n\\nalleged “beef” with Roberts, such testimony would have been\\n\\ncumulative of other testimony and evidence presented at trial that\\n\\ncould support the defense’s theory that Frazier committed the\\n\\n                                  16\\n murder, including: defense trial counsel’s cross-examination of a\\n\\ndetective about Sequoia’s potential bias in favor of Frazier; Williams’\\n\\ntestimony on Frazier and Roberts’s issues, including that Frazier\\n\\nhad sold Roberts’s cars in the past and that Roberts wanted to sell\\n\\nFrazier’s gun to “get even”; and Isaac’s second interview, played\\n\\nbefore the jury, which included his account of Frazier shooting\\n\\nRoberts.\\n\\n     Given the strong evidence of Isaac’s guilt and the cumulative\\n\\nnature of his potential trial testimony, there is not a “reasonable\\n\\nprobability” that had Isaac testified along the lines that he testified\\n\\nat the motion for new trial hearing, “the result of the proceeding\\n\\nwould have been different.” Strickland, \\n466 U.S. at 694\\n (III) (B). See\\n\\nHood v. State, \\n308 Ga. 784\\n, 788-89 (2) (\\n843 SE2d 555\\n) (2020)\\n\\n(concluding there was no prejudice, because “given the strong\\n\\nevidence of [defendant’s] guilt, it is not reasonably probable that the\\n\\noutcome of the trial would have been different even if [an uncalled\\n\\nwitness] had testified at trial”); Mitchell v. State, \\n308 Ga. 1\\n, 7 (2) (b)\\n\\n(\\n838 SE2d 820\\n) (2020) (no prejudice from counsel’s failure to\\n\\n                                   17\\n introduce evidence, in part because evidence of defendant’s guilt was\\n\\nalready “very strong”); Ivey v. State, \\n305 Ga. 156\\n, 162-63 (2) (d) (\\n824\\n\\nSE2d 242\\n) (2019) (defense counsel’s failure to present victim’s\\n\\ntoxicology report did not prejudice defendant in part because report\\n\\n“would have been cumulative of other evidence introduced at trial”\\n\\nand so defendant failed to show how admitting the report “would\\n\\nhave changed the result of the trial”).\\n\\n      3. Isaac also argues that the trial court erred by declining to\\n\\ninstruct the jury on impeachment of a witness through bias toward\\n\\na party. At the charge conference and again after the court charged\\n\\nthe jury, defense trial counsel objected to the trial court not giving\\n\\nthe jury a pattern charge on impeachment of a witness through bias\\n\\ntoward a party.7 The court declined to give the requested charge, but\\n\\n\\n      7 Specifically, Isaac argues that the trial court should have charged the\\n\\njury the following:\\n      “1.31.40 Witness, Attacked (old Impeached) [ ] In determining the\\n      credibility of witnesses and any testimony by them in court, you\\n      may consider, where applicable, evidence offered to [(attack) (cast\\n      doubt upon) (challenge) the credibility [or] believability of] [cause\\n      you to disbelieve] any such witness. This would include evidence\\n      of: Bias toward a part[y]. Shown by “Bad Acts” (extrinsic evidence\\n      or cross-examination)—Specific instances of conduct of the witness\\n\\n                                       18\\n provided the pattern jury charge on the credibility of witnesses.8\\n\\nIsaac argues that the court erred in doing so, contending that there\\n\\nwas slight evidence supporting the requested charge on bias. See\\n\\nMorris v. State, \\n301 Ga. 702\\n, 705 (2) (\\n804 SE2d 42\\n) (2017) (“To\\n\\nauthorize a requested jury instruction, there need only be slight\\n\\nevidence supporting the theory of the charge.” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)).\\n\\n      Pretermitting whether there was slight evidence supporting\\n\\nthe charge on bias, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\\n\\ndeclining to give that charge. For the court to have erred in doing so,\\n\\n\\n\\n      (in question) that may relate to the witness’s (in question’s) bias\\n      toward a party.

In deciding this, you may consider all of the facts\\n      and circumstances of the case, including the witnesses’ manner of\\n      testifying, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts about\\n      which they testify, the nature of the facts about which they testify,\\n      the probability or improbability of their testimony, their interest\\n      or lack of interest in the outcome of the case, and their personal\\n      credibility as you observe it.”\\nSee Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases, §\\n1.31.10 (4th ed., updated January 2024).\\n                                      19\\n the charge declined must not have been “substantially covered by\\n\\nthe charge actually given.” Taylor v. State, \\n272 Ga. 744\\n, 745 (1) (\\n534\\n\\nSE2d 67\\n) (2000) (citation and punctuation omitted). Here, the trial\\n\\ncourt’s charge on the credibility of witnesses already asked jurors to\\n\\nconsider a witness’s “interest or lack of interest in the outcome of the\\n\\ncase,” and thus substantially covered the declined charge on\\n\\nimpeachment of a witness through bias toward a party. See Foster\\n\\nv. State, \\n294 Ga. 383\\n, 386 (7) (\\n754 SE2d 33\\n) (2014) (‘“[T]he trial court\\n\\nthoroughly instructed the jury that it was the arbiter of each\\n\\nwitness’s credibility and that it should give consideration to each\\n\\nwitness’s interest or lack thereof in the outcome of the case. This\\n\\ncharge adequately covered the possible motive, interest, or bias of\\n\\nthe State’s witnesses.”’ (emphasis added; citing Lee v.

Finally, presuming only one deficiency and finding no other\\n\\nerror by defense trial counsel or by the trial court, we conclude that\\n\\nto the extent Isaac argues there was cumulative prejudice entitling\\n\\nhim to a new trial, that argument fails.

SAUDER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        WARREN, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Frederick Sauder was convicted of malice murder\\n\\nand other crimes in connection with the armed robbery of Wayne\\n\\nAlexander on August 4, 2016, and his shooting death several days\\n\\nlater, on August 9 or 10.1 In this appeal, Sauder contends that the\\n\\n\\n        1 In December 2017, a White County grand jury indicted Sauder for the\\n\\nfollowing counts related to the August 4 crimes: armed robbery, aggravated\\nassault, burglary, two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission\\nof a felony (based on aggravated assault and burglary), and possession of a\\nfirearm by a convicted felon. Sauder was also indicted for the following crimes\\nrelated to the shooting on August 9 or 10: malice murder, two counts of felony\\nmurder (based on aggravated assault and burglary), aggravated assault,\\nburglary, three counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\nfelony (based on malice murder, aggravated assault, and burglary), and\\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts of possession of a\\nfirearm by a convicted felon were bifurcated. The remaining counts were tried\\nbefore a jury from February 11 to 19, 2019, and the jury found Sauder guilty\\nof those counts. The bifurcated counts were then nolle prossed. The trial court\\nsentenced Sauder to serve life in prison for malice murder, 20 consecutive years\\nfor armed robbery, 20 concurrent years for burglary, and 5 consecutive years\\neach for four of the counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of\\n evidence presented at his trial was legally insufficient to support\\n\\nseveral of his convictions. He also claims that the trial court abused\\n\\nits discretion by admitting into evidence an excerpt of a phone call\\n\\nhe made while in jail awaiting trial, that the court committed\\n\\nseveral instructional errors, that the State failed to disclose evidence\\n\\nthat two witnesses had “deals” in exchange for their testimony at\\n\\ntrial, and that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective\\n\\nassistance in several respects.           Finally, he contends that the\\n\\ncumulative effect of these alleged errors and deficiencies entitles\\n\\nhim to a new trial.        As we explain below, we vacate Sauder’s\\n\\nconviction for possession of a firearm during the commission of\\n\\naggravated assault to correct a merger error, but we affirm his other\\n\\nconvictions.\\n\\n\\n\\na felony (based on burglary on August 4 and malice murder, aggravated\\nassault, and burglary on August 9 or 10). The remaining counts were vacated\\nor merged. See Dixon v. State, \\n302 Ga. 691\\n, 698 (\\n808 SE2d 696\\n) (2017). Sauder\\nfiled a timely motion for new trial, which he later amended four times through\\nnew counsel. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion\\nin June 2023. Sauder filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court\\nalso denied. He then filed a timely notice of appeal, and the case was docketed\\nto the term of this Court beginning in December 2023 and orally argued on\\nJanuary 10, 2024.\\n                                      2\\n      1.   The evidence presented at Sauder’s trial showed the\\n\\nfollowing. In 2016, 66-year-old Alexander, who was in poor health\\n\\nand had dementia, lived alone in a mobile home on his property in\\n\\nCleveland, Georgia. Joshua Cunningham lived on a farm adjacent\\n\\nto Alexander’s property with several members of his family and his\\n\\ngirlfriend, Heather Holland. Cunningham and Holland often hung\\n\\nout and smoked methamphetamine with Sauder, Luke McClure,\\n\\nand McClure’s wife—all of whom also stayed on the farm.\\n\\n     On August 4, 2016, Cunningham, Holland, Sauder, and his\\n\\nfriend Justin Davis were at the farm when one of them “pointed out”\\n\\nAlexander’s mobile home and mentioned that it was “abandoned.”\\n\\nThey walked to the home, peered in the windows, and eventually\\n\\nwalked back to the farm.     According to Davis, he and Sauder\\n\\ndiscussed going to the mobile home again later. That night, they\\n\\nreturned to Alexander’s property, carrying Sauder’s shotgun and\\n\\ntools “in case [they] needed to break in.”          They smoked\\n\\nmethamphetamine in Alexander’s yard and then checked the doors\\n\\nto the mobile home, which were locked. They attempted to pry open\\n\\n                                3\\n a door, and Sauder kicked a sliding door several times before\\n\\nAlexander opened the door. They walked past Alexander, who said\\n\\nnothing. 2 Sauder, who was holding his shotgun, told Alexander to\\n\\nsit down.\\n\\n       Sauder took Alexander’s wallet, while Davis searched the home\\n\\nand gathered eight to 10 guns, which he found in Alexander’s closets,\\n\\nand a lockbox, which he found under Alexander’s bed. Davis then\\n\\ntook a power saw and some climbing gear from Alexander’s outdoor\\n\\nshed; he loaded those items, the guns, and the lockbox into Sauder’s\\n\\ncar.    At some point, Davis noticed that Alexander’s arm was\\n\\nbleeding; he asked Sauder what happened, and Sauder said that\\n\\nAlexander “came at him.”           As Sauder and Davis tried to leave,\\n\\nSauder’s car got stuck in Alexander’s muddy driveway. Sauder\\n\\ncalled Cunningham, and he and Holland soon arrived and towed\\n\\nSauder’s car out of the driveway. Sauder then dropped off Davis at\\n\\n\\n       2 Davis also testified that Alexander “didn’t even really care” that Sauder\\n\\nand Davis came into the home; Alexander did not “try to resist or do anything”\\nwhen they came in; and Davis “figured he was probably on painkillers or\\nsomething. Just out of his mind . . . .”\\n\\n                                        4\\n his house. Davis kept two guns, the saw, and the climbing gear, and\\n\\nSauder kept the remaining items. The next day, Sauder asked Davis\\n\\nif he wanted to return to Alexander’s home, but Davis said, “No.”\\n\\nSauder told Davis that “he wanted to homestead the place,” which\\n\\nDavis understood to mean that Sauder wanted to claim Alexander’s\\n\\nproperty for himself. Sauder said that he knew some people who\\n\\ncould “get rid of” Alexander.3\\n\\n      According to Cunningham, a few days later, on August 8,\\n\\nSauder, who was a convicted felon and thus unable to purchase a\\n\\ngun, asked Cunningham to accompany him to a pawn shop to trade\\n\\nfour guns that Sauder had for a new firearm. Cunningham agreed,\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 Davis testified that he was charged with armed robbery, aggravated\\n\\nassault, burglary, two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission\\nof a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in connection with\\nthe August 4 crimes; pursuant to an agreement that he would testify at\\nSauder’s trial, he pled guilty to armed robbery but had not yet been sentenced;\\nthe remaining charges, which could have added another 55 years in prison to\\nhis sentence, were dismissed; the maximum sentence for armed robbery was\\nlife in prison, but his plea agreement stated that his sentence would not exceed\\n20 years in prison; there was no agreement that the State would recommend\\nless than 20 years; his sentencing would be “up to the judge at the sentencing\\nhearing”; and he did not have any agreement with the State when he initially\\nspoke to law enforcement officials on August 18, 2016, and gave a statement\\nthat was similar to his testimony at trial.\\n\\n                                       5\\n and later that day, he and Sauder went to the pawn shop, and\\n\\nCunningham traded four guns, three of which Alexander’s wife\\n\\nMelita Alexander (“Melita”) identified at trial as belonging to\\n\\nAlexander, for a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle.4 Sauder carried the\\n\\nrifle out of the pawn shop, and he, Cunningham, and McClure later\\n\\nshot it on the farm for “target practice[ ].”5\\n\\n     The next day, August 9, Melita, who was separated from\\n\\nAlexander but still called him daily and kept many items at his\\n\\nhome, spoke to Alexander on the phone around 3:30 p.m. She called\\n\\nhim again around 9:30 p.m. When he did not answer, she called\\n\\nseveral more times throughout the night but received no response.\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 The owner of the pawn shop testified that he did not remember whether\\n\\nSauder was with Cunningham during the transaction. However, a GBI agent\\nwho interviewed the owner on August 11, 2016, testified that the owner said\\nthat a man who matched Sauder’s description was with Cunningham and that,\\nwhen shown a photo of Sauder, the owner identified him as the man with\\nCunningham.\\n\\n     5 Cunningham testified that he pled guilty to making a false statement,\\n\\ntheft by receiving stolen property, and theft by deception in connection with\\nthe pawn shop transaction; the maximum sentence he could have received was\\n25 years in prison; in exchange for his testimony, he was sentenced as a first\\noffender to five years’ probation and a $1,500 fine; and when an investigator\\ninitially interviewed him before he was charged, he recounted a story similar\\nto his testimony at trial.\\n                                      6\\n Around 6:00 p.m. the next day, August 10, Melita and her boyfriend\\n\\nwent to Alexander’s home to check on him. They saw tire tracks in\\n\\nthe driveway, and they noticed that the door to Alexander’s shed,\\n\\nwhich was normally locked, was ajar. When Melita went inside the\\n\\nmobile home, she saw near the door several of her musical\\n\\ninstruments, which she typically kept in a closet. The home was\\n\\n“ransacked.” Melita noticed jewelry boxes and several empty mason\\n\\njars, in which Alexander typically kept coins, on the floor in the\\n\\nbedroom, and several drawers were open. Alexander, who was dead\\n\\nand “stiff,” was slumped over on the couch with a jacket covering his\\n\\nhead. Investigators who responded to Melita’s 911 call found “pry\\n\\nmarks” on one of the doors to the mobile home and a lock that had\\n\\nbeen cut off the outdoor shed. They collected four .22-caliber shell\\n\\ncasings and two .22-caliber bullets from the scene.\\n\\n     According to Cunningham, Holland, and McClure, on August\\n\\n10 (the day Alexander’s body was found), Sauder was carrying\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 7\\n around a large number of coins.6 Holland and McClure’s wife took\\n\\nthe coins to a bank and converted them to $125 in cash, and\\n\\nMcClure’s wife used the money to rent a motel room.\\n\\n     In addition, Davis testified that at some point, Sauder told him\\n\\nthat he “watched” Alexander’s “ex-wife shoot him”; Cunningham\\n\\ntestified that Sauder told him at some point that he went inside\\n\\nAlexander’s home and Alexander “was already dead”; and McClure\\n\\ntestified that Sauder stated at various times that he went into\\n\\nAlexander’s home, Alexander was “sick and wasn’t doing too good,”\\n\\nAlexander “passed away,” and Sauder covered him with a blanket.\\n\\nMcClure also testified that at various points, Sauder asked McClure\\n\\nto accompany him to Alexander’s home (but McClure said “no”);\\n\\nSauder had a “metal box” with paperwork in it and the guns that\\n\\nMelita identified as belonging to Alexander; Sauder asked McClure\\n\\nand other people who were hanging out with him if they had heard\\n\\ngunshots and said that he had just shot a bear; and Sauder asked\\n\\n\\n\\n     6 Davis testified that neither he nor Sauder took a significant amount of\\n\\ncoins from Alexander on August 4.\\n                                     8\\n McClure to cut his hair shortly after the murder. 7\\n\\n      On August 11, the day after Alexander’s body was found, an\\n\\ninvestigator interviewed Cunningham, who told him about trading\\n\\nthe guns for the rifle at the pawn shop on Sauder’s behalf and about\\n\\nlater shooting the rifle at the farm. With Cunningham’s permission,\\n\\nthe investigator searched an area of the farm where Sauder often\\n\\nstayed and found 16 .22-caliber shell casings on the ground and\\n\\nnumerous partially burned documents that had Alexander’s name\\n\\non them in a burn barrel.\\n\\n      The next day, the investigator obtained a warrant for Sauder’s\\n\\n\\n\\n      7 Cunningham and Cunningham’s mother similarly testified that Sauder\\n\\nmentioned that he shot a bear around the time of the murder and that his\\nstatement did not strike them as unusual because sometimes there were bears\\non their property. Cunningham also testified that Sauder got a haircut around\\nthe time of the murder; McClure added that Sauder asked for a haircut because\\nhis hair was long, and McClure had been “giving him a hard time about how\\nhis hair looked.” The prosecutor asked Melita, her boyfriend, Davis,\\nCunningham, and McClure whether they were involved in the shooting, and\\nthey each denied it.\\n      In addition, McClure testified that he served six-and-a-half years in\\nprison for voluntary manslaughter in connection with an unrelated crime; he\\nwas released in June 2014 (about two years before the shooting) and was on\\nprobation; he was not charged with any crimes related to Alexander’s robbery\\nand shooting; but as a result of his “involvement in this case” and “receipt of\\nstolen property,” his probation was revoked and he was sentenced to a nine-\\nmonth-long, in-custody, substance abuse rehabilitation program.\\n                                      9\\n arrest. On August 16, police officers located Sauder at a motel in\\n\\nAthens. After attempting to communicate with him for about four\\n\\nhours outside his motel room, officers deployed chemical munitions;\\n\\nSauder finally left the room, and he was arrested. Investigators\\n\\nthen searched the motel room and Sauder’s car pursuant to a\\n\\nwarrant and found several cards and documents that had\\n\\nAlexander’s name on them and numerous items that Melita\\n\\nidentified at trial as belonging to her or to Alexander. Under a\\n\\nmattress in the motel room, investigators found the .22-caliber\\n\\nsemiautomatic rifle.\\n\\n     Investigators later searched a house in which Sauder rented a\\n\\nroom around the time of the shooting. Behind the house, they found\\n\\na trash bag that contained a name tag displaying Sauder’s name and\\n\\ndocuments with Alexander’s name on them.        They found more\\n\\ndocuments showing Alexander’s name in a burn barrel on the\\n\\nproperty. In addition, the owner of the property testified that he\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                10\\n saw Sauder carrying the .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle.8\\n\\n       The medical examiner who performed Alexander’s autopsy\\n\\nrecovered three .22-caliber bullets from his body and concluded that\\n\\nhe had been shot several times from an indeterminate range, which\\n\\ncaused his death, likely on August 9 or 10. A firearms examiner\\n\\ndetermined that all of the shell casings that were collected from\\n\\nAlexander’s home and 15 of the 16 shell casings that were collected\\n\\nfrom    Cunningham’s       farm    were    fired   from    the   .22-caliber\\n\\nsemiautomatic rifle. 9\\n\\n       The State also presented a 40-second excerpt of a phone call\\n\\nSauder made to his mother in August 2017, while he was in jail\\n\\nawaiting trial. During the call, Sauder said that “the other guy” was\\n\\nin jail. When his mother asked whether the “other guy” was “ready\\n\\nto point out” the person who shot Alexander, Sauder responded,\\n\\n“What do you mean? He wasn’t there.” He then said that it was\\n\\n\\n       8 Cunningham’s mother also testified that she saw Sauder carrying the\\n\\n.22-caliber rifle in the days surrounding the shooting.\\n       9 However, the examiner could not conclude whether the bullets found at\\n\\nAlexander’s home, the bullets recovered from Alexander’s body, or one of the\\nshell casings found at the farm were fired from the rifle.\\n                                     11\\n “hard to explain,” and he would “not do it over the phone.” An\\n\\ninvestigator testified that Davis was in jail at the time of the call\\n\\nand that the investigator did not know whether McClure was in jail\\n\\nat that time.\\n\\n     Sauder did not testify at trial. His primary defense was that\\n\\nthe State did not meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt that he killed Alexander.\\n\\n     2. (a) Sauder contends that the evidence presented at his trial\\n\\nwas insufficient as a matter of constitutional due process to support\\n\\nhis convictions for armed robbery on August 4, 2016, and malice\\n\\nmurder and three counts of possession of a firearm during the\\n\\ncommission of a felony on August 9 or 10, 2016. 10 This claim fails.\\n\\n     In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process, we view all of the evidence presented at\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     10 Sauder also contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the\\n\\ncounts of aggravated assault on August 4, possession of a firearm during the\\ncommission of that crime, and felony murder, aggravated assault, and burglary\\non August 9 or 10. But he was not sentenced for those crimes, so his claim\\nregarding them is moot. See, e.g., Felts v. State, \\n311 Ga. 547\\n, 551 n.7 (\\n858\\nSE2d 708\\n) (2021).\\n                                     12\\n trial in the light most favorable to the verdicts and consider whether\\n\\nany rational juror could have found the defendant guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt of the crimes of which he was convicted. See\\n\\nJackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n, 319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560)\\n\\n(1979).   “‘We leave to the jury the resolution of conflicts or\\n\\ninconsistencies in the evidence, credibility of witnesses, and\\n\\nreasonable inferences to be derived from the facts.’” Henderson v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 66\\n, 72 (\\n891 SE2d 884\\n) (2023) (citation omitted). A\\n\\njury is authorized to find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable\\n\\ndoubt if the evidence shows either that he “[d]irectly commit[ted] the\\n\\ncrime” or that he was a “party thereto.”          OCGA § 16-2-20.\\n\\n“Conviction as a party to a crime requires proof of a common\\n\\ncriminal intent, which the jury may infer from the defendant’s\\n\\npresence, companionship, and conduct with another perpetrator\\n\\nbefore, during, and after the crimes.” Rooks v. State, \\n317 Ga. 743\\n,\\n\\n751 (\\n893 SE2d 899\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). See\\n\\nalso, e.g., Howard v. State, Case No. S24A0105, \\n2024 WL 1160574\\n,\\n\\nat *3 (decided Mar. 19, 2024). “Mere presence at the crime scene,\\n\\n                                 13\\n however, is insufficient to make someone a party to a crime.” Rooks,\\n\\n317 Ga. at 751 (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Turning first to Sauder’s claim about the August 4 armed\\n\\nrobbery, the indictment charged him with armed robbery by using a\\n\\nfirearm to take Alexander’s guns. See OCGA § 16-8-41 (a) (“A person\\n\\ncommits the offense of armed robbery when, with intent to commit\\n\\ntheft, he or she takes property of another from the person or the\\n\\nimmediate presence of another by use of an offensive weapon . . . .”).\\n\\nSauder argues that the State failed to prove that he “use[d]” a\\n\\nfirearm to accomplish the theft because the evidence presented at\\n\\ntrial showed that Alexander opened the door and sat quietly while\\n\\nSauder and Davis stole his guns. But the element of “use of an\\n\\noffensive weapon” in OCGA § 16-8-41 (a) is satisfied by proof that\\n\\nthe weapon was “used as an instrument of actual or constructive\\n\\nforce—that is, actual violence exerted on the victim or force exerted\\n\\nupon the victim by operating on the victim’s fears of injury to the\\n\\nperson, property, or character of the victim such that the defendant’s\\n\\nacts created a reasonable apprehension on the part of the victim that\\n\\n                                 14\\n an offensive weapon is being used.” Green v. State, \\n304 Ga. 385\\n, 389\\n\\n(\\n818 SE2d 535\\n) (2018) (citation and punctuation omitted).         The\\n\\nevidence showing that Sauder held a shotgun and ordered\\n\\nAlexander to sit down while Davis collected Alexander’s guns\\n\\nauthorized the jury to conclude that Sauder used a firearm to\\n\\naccomplish the theft of the guns.         Thus, the evidence was\\n\\nconstitutionally sufficient to support Sauder’s conviction as a party\\n\\nto the crime of armed robbery. See Jackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n; OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-2-20 (defining parties to a crime). See also Green, \\n304 Ga. at\\n\\n389\\n (holding that evidence that the appellant “pulled out a gun and\\n\\nasked [the victim] what he had in his pockets” was sufficient to prove\\n\\nthat the appellant used an offensive weapon within the meaning of\\n\\nOCGA § 16-8-41 (a)); Bass v. State, \\n356 Ga. App. 862\\n, 867 (\\n849 SE2d\\n\\n718\\n) (2020) (holding that evidence that the appellant “held [a] gun\\n\\nin his hand” while he took items from the victim was sufficient to\\n\\nsupport his armed robbery conviction).\\n\\n     As to the crimes on August 9 or 10, the evidence indicated that\\n\\nafter Sauder and Davis stole guns from Alexander, Sauder\\n\\n                                 15\\n mentioned    “get[ting]     rid     of”    Alexander;    Sauder     enlisted\\n\\nCunningham     to   trade     the     stolen   guns     for   a   .22-caliber\\n\\nsemiautomatic rifle—the gun used to shoot and kill Alexander days\\n\\nlater; Sauder admitted that he returned to Alexander’s home and\\n\\nwas there at the time of the shooting; after the murder, Sauder was\\n\\ncarrying coins and many other items that belonged to Alexander and\\n\\nMelita; and Sauder hid the rifle used in the shooting under a\\n\\nmattress in his motel room. This evidence authorized the jury to\\n\\nfind Sauder guilty at least as a party to the crimes of malice murder\\n\\nand possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. See\\n\\nJackson, \\n443 U.S. at 319\\n; OCGA § 16-2-20. See also Henderson, 317\\n\\nGa. at 72 (holding that evidence that connected the appellant to the\\n\\nmurder weapon and that he admitted he was at the scene of the\\n\\nshootings was constitutionally sufficient to support his malice\\n\\nmurder convictions); Blevins v. State, \\n291 Ga. 814\\n, 815-817 (\\n733\\n\\nSE2d 744\\n) (2012) (concluding that evidence that the appellant was\\n\\nnear the crime scene at the time of the murder and shortly\\n\\nthereafter tried to pawn items that belonged to the victim was\\n\\n                                      16\\n constitutionally sufficient to support his conviction for malice\\n\\nmurder).\\n\\n     (b) Sauder also claims that the evidence was insufficient as a\\n\\nmatter of Georgia statutory law to support his convictions for the\\n\\nAugust 9 or 10 crimes discussed above—malice murder and three\\n\\ncounts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony—\\n\\nbecause the circumstantial evidence failed to exclude the hypothesis\\n\\nthat Cunningham, McClure, or another one of Sauder’s friends\\n\\nkilled Alexander and that Sauder did not participate in the crimes.\\n\\nUnder OCGA § 24-14-6, “[t]o warrant a conviction on circumstantial\\n\\nevidence, the proved facts shall not only be consistent with the\\n\\nhypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude every other reasonable\\n\\nhypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.” Whether an\\n\\nalternative hypothesis is reasonable “is usually a question for the\\n\\njury, as this Court will not disturb the jury’s finding unless it is\\n\\ninsufficient as a matter of law.” Reyes v. State, \\n309 Ga. 660\\n, 664 (\\n847\\n\\nSE2d 194\\n) (2020).\\n\\n     Assuming without deciding that the evidence related to the\\n\\n                                  17\\n August 9 or 10 crimes was entirely circumstantial, the evidence\\n\\nrecounted above was sufficient to authorize the jury to reject as\\n\\nunreasonable Sauder’s alternative hypothesis. As discussed above,\\n\\nthe State presented substantial evidence showing that Sauder\\n\\nparticipated in the shooting, including evidence that he said he\\n\\nwanted to “get rid” of Alexander, he stole numerous items from\\n\\nAlexander’s home after the initial robbery with Davis, he was\\n\\npresent at the time of the shooting, and he possessed the murder\\n\\nweapon. Moreover, when the prosecutor asked Cunningham and\\n\\nMcClure if they were involved in the shooting, they squarely denied\\n\\nit. But even if the jury believed that Cunningham, McClure, or\\n\\nanother one of Sauder’s friends shot Alexander, the jury could have\\n\\nreasonably concluded that Sauder shared with the shooter a\\n\\ncommon criminal intent to kill Alexander.      Thus, the jury was\\n\\nauthorized to reject the hypothesis that Sauder did not participate\\n\\nin the shooting and to instead find that he was guilty at least as a\\n\\nparty to the crimes of malice murder and possession of a firearm\\n\\nduring the commission of a felony.     See, e.g., OCGA § 16-2-20;\\n\\n                                18\\nHoward, 2024\\n WL 1160574, at *3 (explaining that “a jury may infer\\n\\na defendant’s criminal intent, and thereby find him guilty as a party\\n\\nto a crime, ‘from his presence, companionship, and conduct before,\\n\\nduring, and after the offense’”) (citation omitted). See also Reyes,\\n\\n309 Ga. at 664-665 (concluding that evidence that the appellant had\\n\\nthreatened to kill the victim and evidence connecting him to the\\n\\nmurder weapon was sufficient under OCGA § 24-14-6 to support his\\n\\nconviction for malice murder); Blevins, \\n291 Ga. at 815-817\\n (holding\\n\\nthat evidence that the appellant was near the crime scene at the\\n\\ntime of the murder and shortly thereafter tried to pawn items that\\n\\nbelonged to the victim was sufficient under former OCGA § 24-4-6).11\\n\\n      3. Sauder claims next that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nby admitting into evidence the 40-second audio-recorded excerpt of\\n\\nthe jail phone call—in which Sauder’s mother asked if the “other\\n\\nguy” was ready to point out who shot Alexander and Sauder\\n\\n\\n      11 OCGA § 24-4-6, which was part of the old Evidence Code, was carried\\n\\ninto the current Evidence Code in identical form in OCGA § 24-14-6, and there\\nis no materially identical federal rule of evidence, so our case law interpreting\\nthe former provision is still applicable. See Kimbro v. State, \\n317 Ga. 442\\n, 446\\nn.6 (\\n893 SE2d 678\\n) (2023).\\n                                       19\\n responded, “What do you mean? He wasn’t there”—over his objection\\n\\nthat the excerpt was not admissible under subsection (a) of OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-4-408 (“Rule 408”).        For the reasons explained below, we\\n\\ndisagree.\\n\\n     Rule 408 (a) says:\\n\\n     Except as provided in Code Section 9-11-68 [which relates\\n     to liability for attorney fees and litigation expenses when\\n     a party rejects a settlement offer in a tort case], evidence\\n     of:\\n\\n            (1) Furnishing, offering, or promising to furnish; or\\n            (2) Accepting, offering, or promising to accept\\n\\n     a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting\\n     to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either\\n     validity or amount shall not be admissible to prove\\n     liability for or invalidity of any claim or its amount.[12]\\n\\n     12 The remaining subsections of Rule 408 provide:\\n\\n\\n\\n     (b)   Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise\\n     negotiations or mediation shall not be admissible.\\n\\n     (c)   This Code section shall not require the exclusion of any\\n     evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in\\n     the course of compromise negotiations or mediation. This Code\\n     section shall not require exclusion of evidence offered for another\\n     purpose, including, but not limited to, proving bias or prejudice of\\n     a witness, negating a contention of undue delay or abuse of\\n     process, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or\\n     prosecution.\\n\\n                                      20\\n Sauder argues that the excerpt of the phone call should have been\\n\\nexcluded under Rule 408 (a) because during other parts of the call\\n\\n(which were not admitted into evidence), Sauder made statements\\n\\nthat he claims constituted evidence of “an offer to compromise a\\n\\ndisputed claim.” Specifically, Sauder repeatedly asked his mother\\n\\nto call his lawyer and to reach out to the District Attorney to inform\\n\\nthe lawyer and the District Attorney that Sauder was “willing to\\n\\ndeal”; he was “ready to . . . tell [them] all that really happened”; and\\n\\nhe would “pick the person that did it out of a lineup” based on “what\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe note that Rule 408 (a) is materially identical to Federal Rule of Evidence\\n408 (a) (1), which says:\\n\\n     (a) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of the following is not admissible—\\n         on behalf of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity\\n         or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior\\n         inconsistent statement or a contradiction:\\n\\n           (1) furnishing, promising, or offering—or accepting,\\n           promising to accept, or offering to accept—a valuable\\n           consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise\\n           the claim[.]\\n\\nWe therefore look to federal appellate cases for guidance in interpreting the\\nrule. See State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 556 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018). See also\\nRonald L. Carlson & Michael Scott Carlson, Carlson on Evidence 182 (8th ed.\\n2023) (explaining that Georgia Rule 408 follows the federal rule).\\n                                     21\\n [Sauder] saw.” Asserting that these entreaties to his mother were\\n\\nan “offer to compromise” with the State, Sauder claims that the trial\\n\\ncourt abused its discretion by admitting his statement implying that\\n\\nhe was present (and the “other guy” was not) when Alexander was\\n\\nshot, because that statement was part and parcel of such an offer.\\n\\n      Even assuming (without deciding) that Rule 408 (a) could\\n\\napply to exclude a defendant’s attempts “to compromise” with the\\n\\nState by negotiating a plea deal regarding charges in a criminal\\n\\ncase, Sauder has not shown that the statements he made to his\\n\\nmother fell within the ambit of the rule.13 In particular, Sauder cites\\n\\n\\n      13 The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has held\\n\\nthat Federal Rule of Evidence 408 applies in both criminal and civil cases. See,\\ne.g., United States v. Arias, 431 F3d 1327, 1336-1338 (11th Cir. 2005). See also\\nState v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga. 553\\n, 559 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018) (explaining that when\\na rule in our current Evidence Code is materially identical to a Federal Rule of\\nEvidence and there are conflicts ‘among the decisions of the various circuit\\ncourts of appeal[s] in interpreting the federal rules of evidence,’ the precedent\\nof the Eleventh Circuit prevails”) (quoting Ga. L. 2011, pp. 99, 100 § 1). But it\\nappears that the Eleventh Circuit has not addressed whether Federal Rule of\\nEvidence 408 could apply to exclude evidence of plea negotiations. See United\\nStates v. King, \\n623 Fed. Appx. 962\\n, 965-966 (11th Cir. 2015) (addressing the\\nadmissibility of a USPS administrative complaint and cease and desist order\\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 408 in a criminal case); Arias, 431 F3d at 1336-\\n1338 (holding that a state administrative complaint was not admissible under\\nFederal Rule of Evidence 408 in the appellant’s criminal proceeding); United\\nStates v. Pendergraft, 297 F3d 1198, 1211 n.8 (11th Cir. 2002) (noting that a\\n\\n                                       22\\n no pertinent legal authority, and we have found none, to support his\\n\\nassertion that any of the statements at issue here constituted an\\n\\n“offer” within the meaning of Rule 408 (a).14 None of the statements\\n\\nin the excerpt of the recording that was played for the jury\\n\\nmentioned, or even implied, that Sauder wanted to negotiate a plea\\n\\ndeal with the State. And even if we were to assume that these\\n\\nstatements were made in connection with Sauder’s asking his\\n\\nmother to contact his lawyer and the District Attorney to indicate\\n\\n\\n\\nvideo of a civil settlement negotiation in which the appellants participated was\\nadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 408 in the appellants’ criminal\\ncases). See also Federal Practice and Procedure (Wright & Miller) § 5303 (2d\\ned. Feb. 2024 Update) (explaining that several federal circuit courts have held\\nthat Federal Rule of Evidence 408 bars “the use of evidence of civil compromise\\nnegotiations in a criminal prosecution,” but whether the rule applies “to plea\\nbargaining in a criminal case when the evidence of such plea bargaining is\\noffered in a civil or a criminal case” is “more debatable”).\\n      We also note that OCGA § 24-4-410 (4) generally prohibits the State from\\nintroducing against a criminal defendant evidence of “[a]ny statement made in\\nthe course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority\\nwhich does not result in a plea of guilty.” Sauder does not claim that his\\nstatements to his mother should be excluded under that rule.\\n\\n      14 Sauder relies primarily on Nevitt v. CMD Realty Investment Fund IV,\\n\\nL.P., \\n282 Ga. App. 533\\n, 535-538 (\\n639 SE2d 336\\n) (2006). But that case\\ninterpreted former OCGA § 24-3-37, which was part of our old Evidence Code\\nand said, in pertinent part, “admissions or propositions made with a view to a\\ncompromise are not proper evidence.” Because that provision is not part of our\\ncurrent Evidence Code, Nevitt is not applicable. See State v. Almanza, \\n304 Ga.\\n553\\n, 556 (\\n820 SE2d 1\\n) (2018).\\n                                      23\\n that he was “willing” and “ready” to make a deal, that request was\\n\\nnot an “offer” under Rule 408 (a) either; at best, Sauder’s request\\n\\nimplored his mother (who had no authority to negotiate a plea deal\\n\\non his behalf) to initiate contact with the lawyers involved in his\\n\\ncase to ask them to begin discussions that he hoped might lead to\\n\\nhis receiving an offer from the State for a negotiated plea. Simply\\n\\nput, Sauder’s asking his mother to ask the State to provide a plea\\n\\ndeal did not constitute an offer to compromise within the meaning\\n\\nof Rule 408 (a).\\n\\n     Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion by concluding that the statements at issue did\\n\\nnot need to be excluded under that rule.      See United States v.\\n\\nCastillo, 615 F2d 878, 885 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that an\\n\\nappellant’s statement to a prison counselor “that he would probably\\n\\n‘cop’ to a charge of manslaughter” was not excludable under Federal\\n\\nRule of Evidence 408 because the appellant could not have\\n\\nnegotiated a plea deal with the counselor, who had no such\\n\\nauthority). See also United States v. Fernandez, 559 F3d 303, 318\\n\\n                                24\\n (5th Cir. 2009) (noting that Federal Rule of Evidence 408 “would\\n\\nappear to bar” evidence of a proffer letter for the appellant’s\\n\\nimmunity from prosecution but that his “preceding conversation”\\n\\nwith law enforcement agents and “perhaps even his offer to ‘help\\n\\nout”” by providing the agents more information “would remain\\n\\nadmissible”). 15\\n\\n      4. Sauder contends that the trial court erred when, while\\n\\ninstructing the jury about the State’s burden of proof, the court\\n\\ndeclined to give the pattern jury instruction on “grave suspicion,”\\n\\nwhich says, “Facts and circumstances that merely place upon the\\n\\ndefendant a grave suspicion of the crime charged or that merely\\n\\nraise a speculation or conjecture of the defendant’s guilt are not\\n\\n\\n\\n      15  As mentioned above, although Rule 408 (a) excludes evidence of\\ncertain offers and acceptances, Rule 408 (b) more broadly mandates the\\nexclusion of “[e]vidence of . . . statements made in compromise negotiations.”\\n(Emphasis added). See E.E.O.C. v. UMB Bank Financial Corp., 558 F3d 784,\\n791 (8th Cir. 2009) (noting that several federal courts of appeal have held that\\nFederal Rule of Evidence 408 (a) (2), which excludes “conduct or a statement\\nmade during compromise negotiations about the claim,” may apply to “certain\\nwork product, internal memos, and other material created specifically for the\\npurpose of conciliation, even if not communicated to the other party” and\\ncollecting cases). But Sauder does not argue that Rule 408 (b) applies here, so\\nwe do not address it.\\n                                      25\\n sufficient to authorize a conviction of the defendant.”       Georgia\\n\\nSuggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases\\n\\n§ 1.20.20. This claim fails.\\n\\n     “In evaluating a claim that the trial court was required to give\\n\\ncertain jury instructions, we view the charge as a whole to determine\\n\\nwhether the jury was fully and fairly instructed.” Clark v. State, \\n315\\n\\nGa. 423\\n, 440 (\\n883 SE2d 317\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). Here, the trial court thoroughly instructed the jury on the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, the State’s burden to prove beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt each essential element of the charged crimes,\\n\\ncriminal intent, and parties to a crime. Those instructions fully\\n\\ninformed the jury that it was not authorized to find Sauder guilty as\\n\\na party to the crimes if the evidence presented at trial merely raised\\n\\n“a grave suspicion” or “a speculation or conjecture” of his guilt.\\n\\nGeorgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal\\n\\nCases § 1.20.20. And in any event, given the evidence presented at\\n\\ntrial and detailed above, the substantial evidence against Sauder\\n\\nraised more than a grave suspicion of his guilt, at least as a party to\\n\\n                                  26\\n the crimes. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by refusing to\\n\\ninstruct the jury on grave suspicion. See Welch v. State, \\n309 Ga.\\n\\n875\\n, 879 (\\n848 SE2d 846\\n) (2020) (holding that the trial court did not\\n\\nerr by failing to instruct the jury on grave suspicion, because the\\n\\ncourt “‘gave complete instructions on reasonable doubt and\\n\\npresumption of innocence’” and “‘[t]he trial evidence raised more\\n\\nthan a bare suspicion of [the appellant’s] guilt’”) (citations omitted);\\n\\nJenkins v. State, \\n281 Ga. 24\\n, 25 (\\n635 SE2d 714\\n) (2006) (same). See\\n\\nalso Clark, 315 Ga. at 440-441 (concluding that the trial court’s\\n\\nomission of an instruction on grave suspicion was not a clear and\\n\\nobvious error under plain-error review, because the court instructed\\n\\non the presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt, criminal intent,\\n\\nand parties to a crime, which fully informed the jury that it was not\\n\\nauthorized to find the appellant guilty as a party to the crimes\\n\\nunless he shared his co-defendant’s criminal intent to shoot the\\n\\nvictim).\\n\\n     5. Sauder argues that the trial court committed plain error by\\n\\nfailing to provide jury instructions on circumstantial evidence, mere\\n\\n                                  27\\n presence and knowledge, and the law requiring corroboration of an\\n\\naccomplice’s testimony. As Sauder acknowledges, his trial counsel\\n\\ndid not object to the alleged omission of these instructions, so we\\n\\nreview these claims for plain error only. See OCGA § 17-8-58 (b);\\n\\nClark, 315 Ga. at 440. To establish plain error, Sauder must show\\n\\nthat the alleged instructional error “was not affirmatively waived;\\n\\nwas clear and obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute;\\n\\nlikely affected the outcome of the trial; and seriously affected the\\n\\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Id.\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). “An appellant must establish all\\n\\nfour elements of the test in order to demonstrate plain error, so\\n\\nsatisfying this test is difficult, as it should be.” Id. (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). We address each of Sauder’s claims in turn.\\n\\n     (a) With respect to circumstantial evidence, Sauder argues\\n\\nthat the trial court failed to instruct the jury on OCGA § 24-14-6,\\n\\nwhich as discussed above in relation to Sauder’s statutory\\n\\nsufficiency claim, says, “To warrant a conviction on circumstantial\\n\\nevidence, the proved facts shall not only be consistent with the\\n\\n                                  28\\n hypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude every other reasonable\\n\\nhypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.” But the trial court\\n\\ngave the pattern jury instruction on direct and circumstantial\\n\\nevidence, which says, among other things, that the jury “would be\\n\\nauthorized to convict only if the evidence, whether direct,\\n\\ncircumstantial, or both, excludes all reasonable theories of innocence\\n\\nand proves the guilt of the [defendant] beyond a reasonable doubt.”\\n\\nGeorgia Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal\\n\\nCases § 1.30.20 (brackets omitted). That instruction conveyed the\\n\\nsubstance of OCGA § 24-14-6. Thus, the trial court did not err, much\\n\\nless clearly and obviously so, in this respect. See Eubanks v. State,\\n\\n317 Ga. 563\\n, 580 (\\n894 SE2d 27\\n) (2023) (holding that the trial court\\n\\ndid not err by giving the pattern jury instruction on circumstantial\\n\\nevidence rather than instructing that the “State had to disprove any\\n\\ntheory of innocence supported by the evidence,” because the pattern\\n\\ninstruction “effectively conveyed” that point) (emphasis omitted).\\n\\nSee also Hassan v. State, Case No. S24A0026, \\n2024 WL 1160729\\n, at\\n\\n*5 (decided Mar. 19, 2024) (rejecting the appellant’s argument that\\n\\n                                 29\\n a jury instruction, which was similar to the one given in this case,\\n\\nfailed to advise the jury of OCGA § 24-14-6 and holding that the\\n\\ninstruction was not a clear and obvious error).16\\n\\n      (b) Sauder asserts that the trial court’s failure to instruct the\\n\\njury on mere presence and knowledge was plain error. However, as\\n\\ndiscussed above in relation to Sauder’s claim that the court erred by\\n\\nfailing to instruct the jury on grave suspicion, the court thoroughly\\n\\ninstructed on the presumption of innocence, the State’s burden to\\n\\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element of the\\n\\ncharged crimes, criminal intent, and parties to a crime.                 These\\n\\ninstructions adequately informed the jury that it was not authorized\\n\\nto find Sauder guilty if he was merely present at the scene of the\\n\\n\\n      16 Sauder also argues that the trial court incorrectly instructed that the\\n\\njury “should not be concerned about whether the evidence is direct or\\ncircumstantial” and that “[t]here is no legal difference in the weight [the jury]\\nmay give to either direct or circumstantial evidence,” in accordance with the\\npattern jury instruction on direct and circumstantial evidence. See Georgia\\nSuggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases § 1.30.20. But\\nhe cites no authority to support that argument, so he has not carried his burden\\nof showing that the court clearly and obviously erred by giving those\\ninstructions. See Hassan, \\n2024 WL 1160729\\n, at *5 (rejecting the appellant’s\\nclaim that the trial court committed plain error by giving similar jury\\ninstructions, because he cited no controlling authority for the proposition that\\nthe instructions were erroneous).\\n                                       30\\n crime or if he did not knowingly and intentionally participate in the\\n\\ncrimes. Thus, when evaluated in the context of the jury charge as a\\n\\nwhole, the trial court’s failure to expressly instruct on mere presence\\n\\nand knowledge was not a clear and obvious error beyond reasonable\\n\\ndispute. See, e.g., Clark, 315 Ga. at 441 (holding that the trial court\\n\\ndid not clearly and obviously err by failing to instruct the jury on\\n\\nmere presence and knowledge, because the court instructed on the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, the State’s burden of proof, criminal\\n\\nintent, and parties to a crime).\\n\\n     (c) Asserting that Cunningham and McClure were accomplices\\n\\nto the August 9 or 10 crimes, Sauder contends that the trial court\\n\\ncommitted plain error by instructing the jury that the testimony of\\n\\na single witness, if believed, was sufficient to establish a fact without\\n\\nalso instructing that, with respect to those crimes, accomplice\\n\\ntestimony must be corroborated.17 See OCGA § 24-14-8; Doyle v.\\n\\nState, \\n307 Ga. 609\\n, 612-613 (\\n837 SE2d 833\\n) (2020) (explaining that\\n\\n\\n\\n     17  The trial court gave an accomplice-corroboration instruction with\\nrespect to the August 4 crimes.\\n                                   31\\n an accomplice-corroboration instruction is required when there is\\n\\nslight evidence supporting a finding that a witness was an\\n\\naccomplice and that a trial court’s failure to give such an instruction,\\n\\nwhile giving a single-witness instruction, in a case where the\\n\\ndefendant was directly linked to the crimes through an accomplice’s\\n\\ntestimony, generally constitutes a clear and obvious error under\\n\\nplain-error review). Assuming without deciding that Sauder did not\\n\\naffirmatively waive this argument and that there was slight\\n\\nevidence that Cunningham and McClure were accomplices such that\\n\\nthe failure to give an accomplice-corroboration instruction regarding\\n\\nthe August 9 or 10 crimes was a clear and obvious error, Sauder has\\n\\nnot established that any such error likely affected the jury’s guilty\\n\\nverdicts.\\n\\n     Even if an accomplice-corroboration instruction had been\\n\\ngiven, the jury likely would have concluded that Cunningham’s and\\n\\nMcClure’s testimony about the August 9 or 10 crimes was\\n\\nsufficiently corroborated, because the State presented a substantial\\n\\namount of corroborating evidence. In this respect, evidence that\\n\\n                                  32\\n corroborates an accomplice’s testimony\\n\\n     may be circumstantial and it may be slight, and it need\\n     not of itself be sufficient to warrant a conviction of the\\n     crime charged. It must, however, be independent of the\\n     accomplice’s testimony and either directly connect the\\n     defendant with the crime or justify an inference that he is\\n     guilty. In addition, the independent evidence must\\n     corroborate both the identity of the defendant and the fact\\n     of his participation in the crime. In other words,\\n     corroboration of only the chronology and details of the\\n     crimes is not sufficient, and there must be some\\n     independent evidence tending to show that the defendant\\n     himself was a participant in the crimes.\\n\\nCrawford v. State, \\n294 Ga. 898\\n, 900-901 (\\n757 SE2d 102\\n) (2014)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted). Moreover, “‘[i]t is well settled\\n\\nthat an accomplice’s testimony may be corroborated by the\\n\\ntestimony of another accomplice.’” Jackson v. State, \\n314 Ga. 751\\n,\\n\\n755 (\\n879 SE2d 410\\n) (2022) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, Cunningham’s testimony about obtaining the .22-caliber\\n\\nsemiautomatic rifle—the murder weapon—for Sauder at the pawn\\n\\nshop was corroborated by statements from other witnesses,\\n\\nincluding the pawn shop owner’s statement to the GBI agent that\\n\\nSauder was with Cunningham when Cunningham obtained the gun;\\n\\ntestimony from Cunningham’s mother and the owner of the property\\n                                 33\\n where Sauder rented a room that Sauder was carrying the rifle in\\n\\nthe days leading up to the murder; and evidence that investigators\\n\\nfound the rifle in Sauder’s motel room when he was arrested.\\n\\nMcClure’s testimony that, at some point, Sauder asked McClure to\\n\\naccompany him to Alexander’s home was corroborated by Davis’s\\n\\nsimilar testimony that Sauder “wanted to homestead the place” and\\n\\nhad asked Davis if he wanted to return to the home after the August\\n\\n4 robbery. Cunningham and McClure both testified that Sauder was\\n\\ncarrying a significant number of coins on the day Alexander’s body\\n\\nwas found, that Sauder indicated that he had gone inside\\n\\nAlexander’s home and had seen his dead body, and that he had\\n\\nmentioned that he shot a bear around the time of the murder—thus\\n\\ncorroborating each other’s accounts on those points.18 Moreover, the\\n\\n\\n\\n      18 We note that Cunningham and McClure also corroborated each other’s\\n\\ntestimony that Sauder got a haircut around the time of the murder. And in\\nany event, the evidence that Sauder got a haircut near the time of the murder\\nlikely had little impact on the jury’s guilty verdicts, given that McClure\\ntestified that Sauder needed a haircut and that the State presented other, more\\nprobative evidence to show that Sauder tried to evade law enforcement officials\\nafter the crimes, including evidence that Sauder fled to a motel in Athens\\nshortly after the murder an'),\n",

JACKSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       WARREN, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Derylmyaize Jackson was convicted of felony murder\\n\\nand a firearm offense in connection with the shooting death of\\n\\nTazavia Cooper. 1 In his sole claim on appeal, Jackson contends that\\n\\nhis trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object\\n\\nto statements that the prosecutor made during her closing\\n\\nargument. As explained below, we affirm.\\n\\n\\n       1 Cooper was killed on July 5, 2019.   In October 2020, a Thomas County\\ngrand jury indicted Jackson for felony murder based on aggravated assault,\\naggravated assault, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\\nfelony. At a trial from June 28 to 30, 2021, a jury found him guilty of all counts.\\nThe trial court sentenced Jackson to serve life in prison without the possibility\\nof parole for felony murder and five consecutive years for the firearm offense;\\nthe aggravated-assault count merged for sentencing purposes. Jackson filed a\\ntimely motion for new trial, which he later amended through new counsel.\\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion in August 2023.\\nJackson then filed a timely notice of appeal, and the case was docketed to the\\nterm of this Court beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision\\non the briefs.\\n      1. The evidence presented at Jackson’s trial showed the\\n\\nfollowing. On July 5, 2019, Jackson and Cooper exchanged text\\n\\nmessages in which Jackson offered to trade his “[G]lock” handgun\\n\\nfor Cooper’s “[K]el [T]ec” gun. Around 1:15 p.m., Cooper arrived on\\n\\nFeinberg Street in Thomasville, where he and Jackson had arranged\\n\\nto meet.\\n\\n     According to Tahrik Anderson, he and Jackson were hanging\\n\\nout on Feinberg Street when two men, whom Anderson did not know\\n\\nbut whom investigators later identified as David McNair and\\n\\nCooper, arrived in a car. Jackson began “acting weird”; he walked\\n\\nto the driver-side window and discussed “exchang[ing] guns” with\\n\\nCooper, who pulled out a Kel-Tec handgun. Jackson pulled out a\\n\\nblack handgun, which Cooper examined. McNair then got out of the\\n\\npassenger seat, urinated on the ground, got back in the car, and\\n\\nreached down toward the floorboard. Jackson fired shots toward\\n\\nCooper, grabbed the Kel-Tec handgun from Cooper’s lap, and ran\\n\\naway. Anderson fled with Jackson. Although Anderson testified\\n\\nthat he was “in fear of [his] life” because he thought McNair was\\n\\n                                2\\n reaching for a gun, Anderson also testified that he did not hear\\n\\nCooper or McNair threaten Jackson and he did not see McNair with\\n\\na weapon.2\\n\\n     McNair called 911. Investigators who responded to the scene\\n\\nfound Cooper, who had been shot once on the left side of his head,\\n\\nslumped over the center console of the car, dead. McNair was sitting\\n\\non a nearby curb, crying. Investigators did not find any weapons at\\n\\nthe scene, and they did not see any weapons on McNair.3 A crime\\n\\nscene investigator found three Luger 9mm shell casings on the\\n\\nground near the car, which she testified indicated that one gun was\\n\\nfired three times. Based on the location of two bullet holes in the\\n\\nback driver-side window and the position of Cooper’s body on the\\n\\ncenter console, the investigator concluded that the first shot was\\n\\nfired through the open driver-side window, hitting Cooper, who was\\n\\nlikely sitting upright (rather than leaning toward the driver-side\\n\\n\\n     2 On direct examination, Anderson testified that during an interview\\n\\nwith investigators on the day after the shooting, he untruthfully said that\\nJackson shot because McNair “pulled a gun.”\\n\\n     3 McNair did not testify at trial.\\n\\n                                          3\\n window), and causing him to slump over the console; the second and\\n\\nthird shots were then fired through the back driver-side window,\\n\\nindicating that the shooter moved from the driver-side window\\n\\ntoward the back of the car as he shot.\\n\\n     After the shooting, a friend picked up Jackson and Anderson\\n\\nand drove them to a nearby apartment complex. A woman who was\\n\\nat the complex testified that Jackson looked “scared” and said that\\n\\nhe “need[ed] some bleach, [he] just killed someone.” According to\\n\\nAnderson, someone then drove him and Jackson to a friend’s house.\\n\\nJackson had the Kel-Tec handgun there, but Anderson did know\\n\\nwhat ultimately happened to that gun or the gun Jackson used to\\n\\nshoot Cooper. Investigators never recovered the guns. Jackson\\n\\nturned himself in at a police station later that evening.\\n\\n     Jackson did not testify at trial. His theory of defense was that\\n\\nthe State could not meet its burden of proving that he did not act in\\n\\nself-defense.\\n\\n     2.   Jackson   contends    that   his   trial   counsel   provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to object during the\\n\\n                                  4\\n prosecutor’s closing argument. Specifically, Jackson points to the\\n\\nprosecutor’s following statements to the jury, while discussing the\\n\\nState’s burden of proof: “[W]hat it all boils down to, is what your\\n\\nheart and your mind tell you about the evidence. If you find in your\\n\\nheart and your mind that you believe Derylmyaize Jackson\\n\\ncommitted these offenses, then you are authorized to return a\\n\\nverdict of guilty.” Relying primarily on Debelbot v. State, \\n308 Ga.\\n\\n165\\n (\\n839 SE2d 513\\n) (2020), in which we held that the appellants’\\n\\ntrial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the\\n\\nprosecutor’s “‘egregious misstatement of the law’” “that proof beyond\\n\\na reasonable doubt requires something less than proof that leaves a\\n\\njury with 51 percent certainty,” Jackson claims that the prosecutor’s\\n\\nstatements here similarly reduced the State’s burden to prove the\\n\\ncharged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.          \\nId. at 167\\n (citation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance, Jackson must\\n\\nestablish that his counsel’s performance was constitutionally\\n\\ndeficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result. See Strickland\\n\\n                                   5\\n v. Washington, \\n466 U.S. 668\\n, 687 (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674)\\n\\n(1984); Scott v. State, \\n317 Ga. 218\\n, 221 (\\n892 SE2d 744\\n) (2023). To\\n\\nprove deficient performance, Jackson must show that his lawyer\\n\\n“‘performed his duties in an objectively unreasonable way,\\n\\nconsidering all the circumstances and in the light of prevailing\\n\\nprofessional norms.’” \\nId.\\n (citation omitted). To prove prejudice,\\n\\nJackson must demonstrate “‘that there is a reasonable probability\\n\\nthat, but for counsel’s deficiency, the result of the trial would have\\n\\nbeen different.’” \\nId. at 221-222\\n (citation omitted). “A reasonable\\n\\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\\n\\noutcome.” Strickland, \\n466 U.S. at 694\\n.\\n\\n     Assuming (without deciding) that Jackson’s trial counsel\\n\\nperformed deficiently by failing to object to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nstatements about reasonable doubt, Jackson has not established a\\n\\nreasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been\\n\\ndifferent if counsel had objected, so he has not shown prejudice. See\\n\\nScott, 317 Ga. at 222 (explaining that if a defendant fails to make a\\n\\nsufficient showing on one part of the Strickland test, we need not\\n\\n                                  6\\n address the other part).\\n\\n           As we have explained in decisions after Debelbot,\\n     that case involved a specific set of circumstances that\\n     made the prosecutor’s comments about reasonable doubt\\n     uniquely prejudicial. It was already a close question\\n     whether the underwhelming and almost entirely\\n     circumstantial evidence was legally sufficient. That\\n     evidence was unusual in that it showed that the two\\n     defendants had essentially equal opportunities—and no\\n     one else had any opportunity at all—to inflict the fatal\\n     injuries, so the logical probability that either [defendant]\\n     inflicted the fatal trauma would be 50 percent. And, given\\n     that peculiarity, the prosecutor’s suggestion that the jury\\n     could convict a defendant even if it was less than 51\\n     percent sure about the defendants’ guilt was uniquely\\n     harmful. Finally, the trial court’s instruction in Debelbot\\n     that the State is not required to prove its case to “a\\n     mathematical certainty,” a phrase which the State\\n     repeated twice, may well have been understood by the\\n     jury not as correcting the State’s error, but as reinforcing\\n     it.   Absent those unique circumstances, defendants\\n     seeking to establish prejudice from a prosecutor’s\\n     comments that do not accurately characterize reasonable\\n     doubt cannot simply rest on Debelbot.             Instead, a\\n     defendant asserting an ineffective-assistance claim like\\n     the one here must show how a prosecutor’s particular\\n     mischaracterization of reasonable doubt likely affected\\n     how a jury weighed the evidence of his guilt under the\\n     circumstances of his case (and in doing so, show how\\n     objecting to the comments would have created a\\n     reasonable probability of a different outcome).\\n\\nScott, \\n317 Ga. 225\\n-226 (cleaned up).\\n\\n\\n                                  7\\n      Here, although the statements that Jackson points to, if viewed\\n\\nin isolation, may have misinformed the jurors that they would be\\n\\nauthorized to find Jackson guilty if they believed in their “heart[s]”\\n\\nand their “mind[s]” that he was guilty—rather than if the State\\n\\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element of the\\n\\ncharged crimes—Jackson makes no specific argument as to how\\n\\nthese statements affected the outcome of his trial, in light of the\\n\\nevidence of his guilt, other statements that the prosecutor made\\n\\nduring closing, and the trial court’s instructions to the jury. Given\\n\\nthe facts of his case, however, we have no difficulty concluding that\\n\\nthis case is distinguishable from Debelbot. To begin, unlike the\\n\\nevidence in Debelbot, the evidence of Jackson’s guilt was not\\n\\n“underwhelming,” because the State presented significant proof to\\n\\nrebut his claim of self-defense. In this respect, Anderson testified\\n\\nthat Jackson shot Cooper and then stole his gun, Anderson did not\\n\\nhear Cooper or McNair threaten Jackson, and McNair did not have\\n\\na gun. Investigators did not find any weapons at the scene or see\\n\\nany weapons on McNair, and the ballistics evidence suggested that\\n\\n                                  8\\n only one gun was fired at the time of the shooting, indicating that\\n\\nneither Cooper nor McNair shot toward Jackson. And although\\n\\nJackson eventually turned himself in to law enforcement officials,\\n\\nhe fled the crime scene just after the shooting and told a witness\\n\\nthat he needed “bleach” because he had “just killed someone.” See,\\n\\ne.g., Scoggins v. State, \\n317 Ga. 832\\n, 838 (\\n896 SE2d 476\\n) (2023)\\n\\n(noting that flight from the scene of a crime generally can be viewed\\n\\nas circumstantial evidence of guilt).\\n\\n     Moreover, before the prosecutor made the statements at issue\\n\\nhere, she accurately explained that “[t]he burden of proof is always\\n\\non the State to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt.” She\\n\\nalso correctly characterized reasonable doubt as “not arbitrary or\\n\\ncapricious doubt. It’s not a far[-]flung doubt. It’s not a doubt for\\n\\nwhich you can give a mathematical certainty, but it is a doubt of a\\n\\nfair and impartial minded juror honestly seeking the truth. It is a\\n\\ndoubt for which you can give a reason.” In addition, she told the\\n\\njurors that the trial court would instruct them on the law that\\n\\napplied to the case, and the trial court did so. To that end, during\\n\\n                                  9\\n the final jury charge, the trial court thoroughly and properly\\n\\ninstructed the jury on the presumption of innocence, the State’s\\n\\nburden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element\\n\\nof the crimes charged, and the definition of reasonable doubt.4 The\\n\\ncourt then stated, among other things, that it was the court’s duty\\n\\nto instruct the jury on the law, that the jury was bound by such\\n\\ninstructions, that the jury had the responsibility to determine the\\n\\nfacts from the evidence presented and to apply the law to the facts,\\n\\nand that the lawyers’ closing arguments were not evidence.\\n\\n     Thus, to the extent that the prosecutor mischaracterized the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 As to the definition of reasonable doubt, the court said:\\n\\n            A reasonable doubt means just what it says. A reasonable\\n     doubt is a doubt of a fair-minded, impartial juror honestly seeking\\n     the truth. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon common sense\\n     and reason. It does not mean a vague or arbitrary doubt but is a\\n     doubt for which a reason can be given, arising from a consideration\\n     of evidence, a lack of evidence, or a conflict in the evidence.\\n            Now, after giving consideration to all of the facts and\\n     circumstances of this case, if your minds are wavering, unsettled,\\n     or unsatisfied, then that is a doubt of the law, and you must acquit\\n     the defendant. But, if that doubt does not exist in your minds as\\n     to the guilt of the accused, then you would be authorized to convict\\n     the defendant. If the State fails to prove the defendant’s guilt\\n     beyond a reasonable doubt, it would be your duty to acquit the\\n     defendant.\\n                                      10\\n reasonable doubt standard, we cannot say that it was as egregious\\n\\nas the characterization in Debelbot and, unlike in that case, the\\n\\nstatements here were corrected by the trial court’s jury instructions.\\n\\nEspecially given that the evidence of guilt was stronger in this case\\n\\nthan in Debelbot, Jackson has not shown a reasonable probability\\n\\nthat his lawyer’s failure to object to the prosecutor’s statements\\n\\naffected the outcome of his trial, and this claim fails. See, e.g., Scott,\\n\\n317 Ga. 225\\n-226 (assuming that the appellant’s trial counsel\\n\\nperformed deficiently by failing to object to the prosecutor’s\\n\\nstatement during closing argument that “[o]nce you believe that the\\n\\ndefendant is guilty, that is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” among\\n\\nother things, and holding that the appellant failed to show prejudice\\n\\nbecause the evidence of his guilt was strong, the prosecutor told the\\n\\njury that the trial court would instruct on the law, and the court\\n\\nthoroughly instructed the jury on the burden of proof, the\\n\\npresumption of innocence, and reasonable doubt); Warren v.

THE STATE v. STILLMAN.\\n\\n      MARKLE, Judge.\\n\\n      After Enan Stillman pled guilty to two counts of trafficking of persons for sexual\\n\\nservitude (OCGA § 16-5-46 (c)) and one count of pandering for person under 18\\n\\n(OCGA § 16-6-12), the trial court vacated the trafficking charges based on the rule of\\n\\nlenity, and sentenced Stillman only on the pandering charge. The State now appeals,\\n\\narguing that the trial court erred (1) because the first trafficking charge contained\\n\\ndifferent elements from that of pandering, and (2) because the second trafficking\\n\\ncharge specifically alleged that Stillman subjected and maintained the victim, who was\\n\\nunder 18 years of age, in sexual servitude, which is a crime different from pandering.\\n For the reasons that follow, we reverse Stillman’s conviction and remand the case to\\n\\nthe trial court for resentencing.\\n\\n      The record shows that, on December 16, 2019, Stillman met the then-16-year-\\n\\nold high school student on a website known as “SeekingArrangements.com,” a\\n\\nwebsite used for connecting older men with younger women for the purpose of sex.\\n\\nThe victim had created a profile on the website indicating that she was 18 years old.\\n\\nAt some point, Stillman inquired into the victim’s age, at which time she told him she\\n\\nwas actually 17 years old. After connecting through the website, Stillman picked the\\n\\nvictim up from school, took her to a hotel, and paid her $500 for oral and vaginal sex.\\n\\nDuring the encounter, Stillman offered to pay the victim $500 for each future sexual\\n\\nencounter and $3,000 to travel with him on vacation. Afterwards, Stillman drove the\\n\\nvictim back to school. Later that same day, the victim’s father discovered what had\\n\\noccurred between her and Stillman, causing her to run away from home. Shortly\\n\\nthereafter, she was picked up by law enforcement, and a criminal investigation of\\n\\nStillman ensued.\\n\\n      Stillman was charged with two counts of trafficking persons for sexual servitude\\n\\nand one count of pandering of a person under 18 years of age. Stillman entered a non-\\n\\n\\n                                          2\\n negotiated guilty plea to all charges. Prior to the plea hearing, Stillman moved the trial\\n\\ncourt to enter judgment against him only for the pandering count. At the plea hearing,\\n\\nStillman again orally moved the trial court to convict and sentence him only on the\\n\\npandering charge because, as a matter of law, he could only be convicted of pandering\\n\\nas the initial solicitation of the victim was the only crime he committed, and because\\n\\nthe two counts for trafficking essentially charged the same crime as pandering. The\\n\\ntrial court granted Stillman’s motion, vacated the trafficking charges based on the rule\\n\\nof lenity, and sentenced Stillman on the pandering count.1 The State now appeals.\\n\\n      Before turning to the merits of the State’s argument, we first set forth the\\n\\nrelevant law.\\n\\n      The rule of lenity applies when a statute, or statutes, establishes, or\\n      establish, different punishments for the same offense, and provides that\\n      the ambiguity is resolved in favor of the defendant, who will then receive\\n      the lesser punishment. The fundamental inquiry when making this\\n      assessment, then, is whether the identical conduct would support a\\n      conviction under either of two crimes with differing penalties, i.e.,\\n      whether the statutes define the same offense such that an ambiguity is\\n      created by different punishments being set forth for the same crime. The\\n\\n      1\\n       At the sentencing hearing, the trial court initially imposed a $10,000 fine, but\\nsubsequently changed the fine to $5,000 and required Stillman to reimburse the crime\\nvictims fund $7,540.94.\\n                                            3\\n       essential requirement of the rule of lenity is that both crimes could be\\n      proved with the same evidence. As the Supreme Court of Georgia\\n      recently explained, when one offense has been criminalized by two\\n      different statutory provisions, one of which provides a lesser punishment\\n      than the other ..., the statutory provision imposing the greater\\n      punishment is effectively abrogated by the provision imposing the lesser\\n      punishment, and the defendant cannot be properly prosecuted or convicted\\n      under the more stringent provision. The effect of completely overlapping\\n      and therefore ambiguous criminal statutes is that the defendant can be\\n      subject only to the statute with the lesser penalty.\\n\\n\\n(Citations and punctuation omitted, emphasis in original.) Towns v. State, \\n357 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 701\\n, 702 (\\n849 SE2d 249\\n) (2020).

State, \\n293 Ga. 282\\n, 284 (\\n745\\n\\nSE2d 646\\n) (2013). In other words, under the rule,\\n\\n      where any uncertainty develops as to which penal clause is applicable,\\n      the accused is entitled to have the lesser of the two penalties\\n      administered. The rule of lenity applies where the same conduct would\\n      support either a misdemeanor or a felony conviction and requires that\\n      both crimes could be proved with the same evidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           4\\n (Citation and punctuation omitted.)

Further, when the language of a statute is\\n      plain and susceptible of only one natural and reasonable construction,\\n      courts must construe the statute accordingly.\\n\\n\\n(Citation omitted.)

App. 116\\n, 117 (\\n806 SE2d 226\\n) (2017). With\\n\\nthese principles in mind, we turn to the State’s arguments.\\n\\n      1. The State first argues on appeal that the trial court erred in vacating the first\\n\\ntrafficking count and instead convicting and sentencing Stillman for pandering\\n\\n\\n                                           5\\n because Stillman did more than just solicit the victim for sex, as required for the\\n\\npandering offense, in that he recruited the 16-year-old victim and had sex with her. We\\n\\nagree.\\n\\n         Here, Count 1 of the indictment charged Stillman with trafficking of persons for\\n\\nsexual servitude in that he did “knowingly recruit, entice, harbor, transport, patronize\\n\\nand obtain [the victim], an individual under 18 years of age, for the purpose of sexual\\n\\nservitude.” And Count 3 charged Stillman with pandering for person under 18 in that\\n\\nhe did “then and there unlawfully solicit [the victim], an individual under 18 years of\\n\\nage, to perform an act of prostitution in her own behalf.”\\n\\n         Pursuant to OCGA § 16-5-46 (c) (1) (2) (effective July 1, 2019), “[a] person\\n\\ncommits the offense of trafficking an individual for sexual servitude when that person\\n\\nknowingly: (1) [s]ubjects an individual to or maintains an individual in sexual\\n\\nservitude; (2) [r]ecruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, solicits, patronizes, or\\n\\nobtains by any means an individual for the purpose of sexual servitude[.]” “Sexual\\n\\nservitude” means any sexually explicit conduct or performance involving sexually\\n\\nexplicit conduct for which anything of value is directly or indirectly given, promised\\n\\nto, or received by any individual, which conduct is induced or obtained: . . . [f]rom an\\n\\n\\n                                             6\\n individual who is under the age of 18 years.” OCGA § 16-5-46 (a) (8) (B). Any person\\n\\nwho commits the offense of trafficking an individual under 18 years of age is guilty of\\n\\na felony punishable by imprisonment for not less than 25 nor more than 50 years or life\\n\\nimprisonment and a fine not to exceed $100,000.00. OCGA § 16-5-46 (f) (1).\\n\\n       In contrast, “[a] person commits the offense of pandering when he or she\\n\\nsolicits a person to perform an act of prostitution in his or her own behalf . . . .”\\n\\nOCGA § 16-6-12. Any person convicted of pandering a person under the age of 18\\n\\nyears is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for a period of not less than ten\\n\\nnor more than 30 years and a fine of not more than $100,000.00. OCGA § 16-6-13 (b)\\n\\n(2).\\n\\n       Here, the indictment did not predicate the two offenses on the same conduct\\n\\nor act. Notably, the State did not include “solicit” in Count 1. On the other hand, the\\n\\npandering statute includes only the act of soliciting the victim who is under the age of\\n\\n18 years, as the State charged in Count 3. Thus, although the two defined crimes may\\n\\naddress similar criminal conduct, there is no ambiguity between these statutes because\\n\\nthe State did not charge Stillman with the same conduct in Count 1 as in Count 3.\\n\\nKoroma v. State, \\n350 Ga. App. 530\\n, 532-533 (2) (\\n827 SE2d 903\\n) (2019). In other words,\\n\\n\\n                                           7\\n as charged in the indictment, the State could prove that Stillman completed the act of\\n\\npandering by having solicited the victim, without proof of all the elements comprising\\n\\nthe act of trafficking charged in Count 1. Stillman, however, did more than merely\\n\\nsolicit the victim for sex. He solicited the victim, picked her up from her school, took\\n\\nher to a hotel, had sex with her, and paid her for the service. As such, the trafficking\\n\\ncount in the indictment alleges a crime separate and distinct from the pandering count\\n\\nsuch that the rule of lenity does not apply. Koroma, 350 Ga. App. at 532-533 (2) (rule\\n\\nof lenity did not apply where the indictment did not predicate the three offenses on\\n\\nthe same conduct or act; rather, each offense, as charged, was predicated on a separate\\n\\nsexual act); see also Gordon v. State, \\n337 Ga. App. 64\\n, 68 (1) (\\n785 SE2d 900\\n) (2016)\\n\\n(the two offenses of aggravated assault and felony obstruction, as described in the\\n\\nindictment and the Code, were not proved by the same evidence, and thus the rule of\\n\\nlenity did not apply); White v. State, \\n319 Ga. App. 530\\n, 532-533 (2) (\\n737 SE2d 324\\n)\\n\\n(2013) (the crimes of cruelty to children in the second degree and third degree, as\\n\\nalleged in the indictment, could not be proven by the same evidence, and thus the rule\\n\\nof lenity did not apply); compare Gordon v. State, \\n334 Ga. App. 633\\n, 641 (\\n780 SE2d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                     8\\n 376) (2015) (where the two statutes at issue for making a false statement provided\\n\\ndifferent punishment ranges for the same criminal conduct, rule of lenity applied).\\n\\n      Accordingly, the trial court erred by applying the rule of lenity to these charges.\\n\\n      2. The State next argues that the trial court erred in vacating Count 2 for\\n\\ntrafficking and instead convicting and sentencing Stillman only for pandering because\\n\\nCount 2 specifically alleged that Stillman had sex with the victim in exchange for\\n\\nmoney, and sexual conduct is not an element of pandering. Again, we agree.\\n\\n      The same analysis with respect to Count 1 dictates that we reach the same\\n\\nconclusion with regard to this trafficking count. Here, again, the indictment did not\\n\\npredicate the trafficking and pandering charges on the same conduct. Count 2 of the\\n\\nindictment charged Stillman with trafficking of persons for sexual servitude in that he\\n\\ndid “knowingly subject and maintain” the victim, an individual under 18 years of age,\\n\\nin sexual servitude. And Count 3 charged Stillman with pandering for unlawfully\\n\\nsoliciting the victim, who was under the age of 18, to perform an act of prostitution in\\n\\nher own behalf.\\n\\n      Pandering only entails the act of soliciting the victim for sex and does not include\\n\\nthe element of sexual conduct required under the trafficking statute. OCGA §§ 16-5-\\n\\n\\n                                           9\\n 46 (c) (1); 16-6-12. As such, the second trafficking charge alleges a crime separate and\\n\\ndistinct from the pandering charge, and requires additional proof, such that the rule\\n\\nof lenity does not apply. Koroma, 350 Ga. App. at 532-533 (2); see also Gordon, \\n337 Ga.\\n\\nApp. at 68\\n (1); White, \\n319 Ga. App. at 532-533\\n (2). Therefore, the trial court erred in\\n\\napplying the rule of lenity to this count, as well. Accordingly, we reverse the trial\\n\\ncourt’s judgment, and remand the case to the trial court for resentencing.2\\n\\n      Judgment reversed and case remanded with direction. Miller, P. J., and Land, J.,\\n\\nconcur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2\\n        We further note that, upon resentencing, the lesser crime of pandering in\\nCount 3 should merge with the trafficking charges in Counts 1 and 2 for purposes of\\nsentencing.

We lack\\njurisdiction because the appeal is premature.\\n      Under OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1), appeals generally may be taken from “[a]ll final\\njudgments, that is to say, where the case is no longer pending in the court below.”\\nAnd under OCGA § 5-6-38 (a), “[a] notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of\\nthe judgment being appealed, or, if a motion for new trial is filed within 30 days of the\\njudgment, ‘the notice shall be filed within 30 days after the entry of the order granting,\\noverruling, or otherwise finally disposing of the motion.’” Hann v. State, \\n292 Ga.\\nApp. 719\\n, 719 (1) (\\n665 SE2d 731\\n) (2008) (quoting OCGA § 5-6-38 (a)).\\n      Here, the record contains no indication that the trial court has ruled on\\nGarvin’s motion for a new trial or his motion to withdraw such motion. See Heard v.\\nState, \\n274 Ga. 196\\n, 196-197 (1) (\\n552 SE2d 818\\n) (2001) (holding that a party may not\\nwithdraw a motion for new trial by filing a “dismissal” of the motion; a trial court\\nmust enter an order in connection with that action). Therefore, his notice of appeal\\n— filed while his motion for new trial remains pending before the trial court — is\\npremature. “A notice of appeal filed while a motion for new trial is pending and\\nunaccompanied by a proper certificate of immediate review does not confer\\n jurisdiction in the appellate courts.” Hann, \\n292 Ga. App. at 720\\n (1); see also OCGA\\n§ 5-6-34 (b). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction over this premature appeal, which is\\nhereby DISMISSED.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\n                                           Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\\n                                                                      07/02/2024\\n                                               I certify that the above is a true extract from\\n                                       the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\n                                              Witness my signature and the seal of said court\\n                                       hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                      , Clerk.\\n '),\n",

MCCABE V. THE STATE.\\n                       S24A0294. DUNSTON V. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        ELLINGTON, Justice.\\n\\n        Dallas McCabe and Akhemu Dunston appeal their convictions\\n\\nfor felony murder and criminal attempt to sell marijuana in\\n\\nconnection with the shooting death of Joseph Jackson.1 Both\\n\\n\\n        1 The crimes occurred on July 16, 2019. On March 10, 2021, an Oconee\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted McCabe, Dunston, and Ryan O’Neal for malice\\nmurder, three counts of felony murder, and one count each of criminal attempt\\nto commit robbery by force, criminal attempt to sell marijuana, and aggravated\\nassault with a deadly weapon. O’Neal was also charged in the same indictment\\nwith possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. By agreement\\nof the parties, McCabe and Dunston were tried separately from O’Neal. (O’Neal\\nwas convicted of malice murder and the firearm offense, and we affirmed his\\nconvictions on appeal. See O’Neal v. State, 316 Ga. 264 (888 SE2d 42) (2023).)\\nAfter a jury trial that ended on June 21, 2021, McCabe and Dunston were each\\nfound guilty on all counts with which they were charged except malice murder\\nand aggravated assault. On that same day, McCabe and Dunston were each\\nsentenced to serve life in prison for felony murder predicated on criminal\\nattempt to commit robbery by force and a concurrent five-year prison term for\\ncriminal attempt to sell marijuana. The other two felony-murder counts were\\nvacated by operation of law, and the charge of criminal attempt to commit\\nrobbery by force was merged into the felony-murder conviction. McCabe and\\n appellants contend that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the\\n\\njury’s verdicts and that the trial court erred by denying their motion\\n\\nfor mistrial based on juror misconduct. McCabe separately contends\\n\\nthat the trial court erred by denying his request to strike jurors for\\n\\nmisconduct and that trial counsel rendered constitutionally\\n\\nineffective assistance. Dunston separately contends that the trial\\n\\ncourt erred in failing to charge the jury more fully on proximate\\n\\ncause and in failing to sever his trial from McCabe’s. For the reasons\\n\\nexplained below, we affirm.\\n\\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdicts, the evidence\\n\\npresented at trial showed that Dunston, McCabe, and their co-\\n\\nindictee Ryan O’Neal drove to Jackson’s home on the evening of July\\n\\n16, 2019, with a plan to rob Jackson when they met him on the street\\n\\nin front of his home to sell him marijuana. As they were attempting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDunston each filed a timely motion for new trial, which each amended on April\\n20, 2023, McCabe through new counsel and Dunston through his trial counsel.\\nAfter a hearing on May 4, 2023, the trial court separately denied each amended\\nmotion for new trial on July 28, 2023. McCabe and Dunston each filed a timely\\nnotice of appeal, and the cases were docketed in this Court to the term\\nbeginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                      2\\n to rob Jackson, McCabe drove off, and Jackson attempted to hold\\n\\nonto the car to retrieve his property. Jackson, who was dragged\\n\\nbeside the car for about 100 yards, finally let go when O’Neal shot\\n\\nand fatally wounded him.\\n\\n     Dunston, his brother Quentin, and O’Neal had grown up\\n\\ntogether. The evidence shows that Dunston had sold marijuana to\\n\\nJackson before. On the day of the shooting, Dunston messaged\\n\\nJackson through Instagram, offering to sell him marijuana, and at\\n\\n8:41 p.m., Jackson agreed to buy a certain amount for $30. Several\\n\\nminutes before 9:00 p.m., Dunston texted McCabe about taking part\\n\\nin a robbery – which he called “a money move” – that he believed\\n\\nwould yield about $500. McCabe responded that he was “down for\\n\\nit” and instructed Dunston to “set it up.” Prior Instagram\\n\\ncommunications between Dunston and McCabe revealed that they\\n\\nhad previously discussed committing robberies, using slang terms\\n\\nlike “lick” and “play.” The record also shows that Dunston called\\n\\nO’Neal several times that day.\\n\\n     Soon after the sale of marijuana was arranged, McCabe drove\\n\\n                                 3\\n his car to pick up Dunston, O’Neal, and Quentin, and he took them\\n\\nto Jackson’s home. Jackson lived with his grandparents in\\n\\nWatkinsville. Dunston was in the front passenger seat, O’Neal sat\\n\\nbehind Dunston, and Quentin was in the rear driver-side seat. They\\n\\narrived at about 9:45 p.m. and met Jackson on the street outside of\\n\\nhis home. As Jackson inspected the marijuana, Dunston asked for\\n\\nJackson’s cell phone so that he could share his brother Isaiah’s\\n\\nphone number with him. Jackson handed Dunston his phone, but\\n\\nDunston did not return it, and McCabe began to drive off. Jackson\\n\\njumped on the car and held on in an attempt to recover his property,\\n\\nbut McCabe continued driving and dragging Jackson down the road.\\n\\nO’Neal shot Jackson through the rear passenger-side window,\\n\\nshattering the glass. Jackson’s phone “flew” out the front passenger-\\n\\nside car window, and Jackson let go of the car.\\n\\n     Later that evening, a shirtless, shoeless, disoriented, and\\n\\nblood-covered Jackson knocked on his grandparents’ back door. The\\n\\nrecord shows that Jackson’s grandfather called 911 at 11:54 p.m.\\n\\nPolice and emergency medical personnel responded immediately,\\n\\n                                 4\\n and Jackson was taken to the hospital, where he died the following\\n\\nday from his wounds. About 100 yards from Jackson’s house, officers\\n\\nfound on the side of the road Jackson’s shirt, cell phone, and ring.\\n\\nBlood and shattered glass consistent with tempered glass from a car\\n\\nwindow were also on the ground in close proximity to Jackson’s\\n\\npersonal belongings. Jackson’s grandfather testified that about $30\\n\\nto $40 was missing from where Jackson normally kept his cash.\\n\\n     The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Jackson’s\\n\\nbody observed abrasions over most of his body consistent with “road\\n\\nrash” or “prolonged contact” with pavement. She further testified\\n\\nthat Jackson had a bruise on his left arm consistent with a sharp\\n\\nedge, like the top part of a car window, as well as blunt force injuries\\n\\nto his hands. She recovered a 9-millimeter bullet from his body. The\\n\\nmedical examiner testified that Jackson died due to a gunshot\\n\\nwound to his chest, blunt-force head trauma, and massive blood loss.\\n\\n     On the day after the shooting, Dunston deleted his Instagram\\n\\naccount. He also texted a friend to “tell [McCabe] he can’t be driving\\n\\nhis car like that [because] they [are] looking for a car with no back\\n\\n                                   5\\n window.” After Dunston was arrested on July 30 for failure to\\n\\nappear in court on an unrelated charge, he told police officers that\\n\\nO’Neal shot Jackson when Jackson got upset following a drug deal.\\n\\nDunston did not admit that he tried to rob Jackson, but did admit\\n\\nthat he deleted his Instagram account the day after the shooting.\\n\\n     Just after midnight on August 1, officers found O’Neal hiding\\n\\nat a senior living facility in a closet of an apartment whose resident\\n\\ndid not know he was there. The officers arrested O’Neal and found a\\n\\n9-millimeter pistol and related ammunition in his possession. An\\n\\nexpert in firearms examination and identification with the GBI\\n\\ndetermined that the gun obtained from O’Neal fired the bullet that\\n\\nkilled Jackson. The firearms expert also determined that the pistol\\n\\nwas in working order, would not fire unless the trigger was pulled,\\n\\nand required 7.25 pounds of pressure to pull the trigger.\\n\\n     After the shooting, McCabe fled Georgia and eventually\\n\\ntraveled to Mexico, where he obtained a new phone number and\\n\\ncreated a social media account using an alias. On August 1, pictures\\n\\nof McCabe’s car, which showed damage to the rear passenger-side\\n\\n                                  6\\n window, were taken by tag-reader cameras in Texas as McCabe\\n\\ndrove through the state. McCabe was located by the FBI, arrested\\n\\nby Mexican authorities, and returned to the United States.\\n\\n     In a pre-trial interview, McCabe admitted driving his car\\n\\nduring the murder. He contended, however, that Dunston had\\n\\noffered him $30 for a ride and that he had no idea there was going\\n\\nto be a robbery. McCabe said that Dunston took $30 from Jackson\\n\\nand tried to roll the car window up without giving Jackson any\\n\\nmarijuana. McCabe admitted that Jackson grabbed onto his car and\\n\\nbegan beating on the window, that McCabe started to drive away,\\n\\nand that O’Neal shot Jackson, breaking the rear passenger-side\\n\\nwindow. McCabe said that he drove away because O’Neal and\\n\\nDunston threatened him, McCabe knew they were gang members,\\n\\nand he was not. But McCabe’s cell phone contained digital images of\\n\\nhim posing with Bloods gang members and flashing gang signs while\\n\\nhe was in Mexico. Dunston also revealed his Bloods gang affiliations\\n\\nin social media posts, and he and McCabe shared and understood\\n\\nthe same Bloods slang. McCabe told the police that he had\\n\\n                                 7\\n abandoned his car after the incident, and it was never recovered.\\n\\n     Although Quentin was originally charged along with the others\\n\\nin connection with Jackson’s murder, the charges were dismissed\\n\\ndue to insufficient evidence against him. Quentin, who was granted\\n\\nimmunity from prosecution, testified that O’Neal shot Jackson\\n\\n(although Quentin testified in O’Neal’s trial that McCabe shot\\n\\nJackson). Quentin said that O’Neal was “acting weird” and “talking\\n\\ncrazy” and that O’Neal said he had taken the drug Xanax. Quentin\\n\\nalso testified that McCabe was the driver. Quentin denied that\\n\\nDunston attempted to take Jackson’s phone, but Quentin was\\n\\nimpeached with his pre-trial statement to the contrary.\\n\\n     1. Both McCabe and Dunston contend that the evidence was\\n\\nconstitutionally insufficient to support the jury’s verdicts.\\n\\n     When evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence as a\\n     matter of federal constitutional due process, we view the\\n     evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to\\n     the prosecution and consider whether it was sufficient to\\n     authorize a rational trier of fact to find the defendant\\n     guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes of which\\n     he was convicted. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307,\\n     319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979)[.]\\n\\n\\n                                   8\\n O’Neal v. State, 316 Ga. 264, 266 (1) (888 SE2d 42) (2023). “This\\n\\nCourt does not reweigh evidence or resolve conflicts in testimony;\\n\\ninstead, evidence is reviewed in a light most favorable to the verdict,\\n\\nwith deference to the jury’s assessment of the weight and credibility\\n\\nof the evidence.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     The co-defendants’ felony-murder convictions were predicated\\n\\non criminal attempt to commit robbery by force, a felony. Felony\\n\\nmurder occurs when a person “causes the death of another human\\n\\nbeing irrespective of malice” during the commission of a felony.\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-1 (c). “A person commits the offense of criminal\\n\\nattempt when, with intent to commit a specific crime, he performs\\n\\nany act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission\\n\\nof that crime.” OCGA § 16-4-1. A person commits robbery by force\\n\\n“when, with intent to commit theft, he takes property of another\\n\\nfrom the person or the immediate presence of another . . . [b]y use of\\n\\nforce[.]” OCGA 16-8-40 (a) (1). And it is “unlawful for any person to\\n\\n. . . sell . . . marijuana.” OCGA § 16-13-30 (j) (1). “Every person\\n\\nconcerned in the commission of a crime is a party thereto and may\\n\\n                                  9\\n be . . . convicted of commission of the crime.” OCGA § 16-2-20 (a). A\\n\\nperson is a party to a crime if that person “[d]irectly commits the\\n\\ncrime; . . . [i]ntentionally aids or abets in the commission of the\\n\\ncrime; or . . . [i]ntentionally advises, encourages, hires, counsels, or\\n\\nprocures another to commit the crime.” OCGA § 16-2-20 (b).\\n\\n     To convict McCabe and Dunston of felony murder, “the State\\n\\nwas not required to prove that [either of them] personally fired the\\n\\nshot that killed” Jackson, only that each of them was a party to the\\n\\ncrimes as defined in OCGA § 16-2-20 (b). Frazier v. State, 308 Ga.\\n\\n450, 453 (2) (a) (841 SE2d 692) (2020). Moreover, McCabe and\\n\\nDunston could be found guilty of felony murder even if neither of\\n\\nthem intentionally aided or encouraged the shooting of Jackson, as\\n\\nlong as each of them “was a party to the underlying felony that was\\n\\na proximate cause of” Jackson’s death. Id. “Proximate causation\\n\\nimposes liability for the reasonably foreseeable results of criminal\\n\\nconduct if there is no sufficient, independent, and unforeseen\\n\\nintervening cause.” Id. (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     (a) McCabe contends that the evidence was insufficient to\\n\\n                                  10\\n support the jury’s verdicts because, although he associated with\\n\\ngang members, picked up his friends in exchange for gas money, and\\n\\nwas asked to stop at Jackson’s home for a marijuana sale, he was\\n\\nnot involved in the planning or the sale itself. McCabe further\\n\\nargues that the shooting was an unplanned action by O’Neal alone\\n\\nand that there was no evidence that McCabe knowingly participated\\n\\nin, or was even aware of, a plan to rob, shoot, or harm Jackson in\\n\\nany way. Instagram messages introduced in evidence, however,\\n\\nshowed that McCabe and Dunston planned a robbery less than an\\n\\nhour before they drove to Jackson’s home. The evidence also shows\\n\\nthat McCabe agreed to drive Dunston and O’Neal to the prearranged\\n\\nmarijuana sale; that Jackson’s phone was taken and forcibly\\n\\nretained before Dunston lost control of it at the scene; that McCabe\\n\\ndrove away while Jackson was shot; and that McCabe fled the State\\n\\nand the country to avoid capture. This evidence authorized the jury\\n\\nto infer that McCabe shared with Dunston and O’Neal a common\\n\\ncriminal intent to rob Jackson. See Barrett v. State, 312 Ga. 676, 680\\n\\n(1) (a) (864 SE2d 403) (2021) (“[C]riminal intent may be inferred\\n\\n                                 11\\n from presence, companionship, and conduct before, during, and after\\n\\nthe offense.” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     A rational jury therefore could find McCabe guilty beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt, at least as a party to the crimes, of felony murder\\n\\npredicated on attempted robbery by force and of criminal attempt to\\n\\nsell marijuana. See Perez v. State, 316 Ga. 433, 438 (2) (888 SE2d\\n\\n526) (2023) (holding that evidence was sufficient to find guilt of\\n\\nfelony murder based on armed robbery where the testimony and\\n\\nevidence including text messages showed that the appellant and two\\n\\nco-indictees planned to rob the victim on the pretext of a marijuana\\n\\ntransaction, that one co-indictee shot the victim prior to or\\n\\ncontemporaneously with the taking of the marijuana, and that the\\n\\nthree co-indictees fled); Williams v. State, 304 Ga. 658, 662 (1) (821\\n\\nSE2d 351) (2018) (The appellant’s “conduct before, during, after the\\n\\noffense supported the jury’s conclusion that he shared an intent to\\n\\ncommit an armed robbery of the victim,” and “because the fatal\\n\\nshooting of an armed robbery victim may be said to be a probable\\n\\nconsequence of the armed robbery, and all the participants in a plan\\n\\n                                 12\\n to rob are criminally responsible for the act of each committed in the\\n\\nexecution of the plan and which may be said to be a probable\\n\\nconsequence of the unlawful design, there was sufficient evidence\\n\\nfor the jury to conclude that [the appellant] was a party to the crime\\n\\nof felony murder” predicated on criminal attempt to commit armed\\n\\nrobbery. (citation and punctuation omitted)); Menzies v. State, 304\\n\\nGa. 156, 160-162 (II) (816 SE2d 638) (2018) (“[R]obbery is a\\n\\ndangerous business, and it carries the foreseeable risk that the\\n\\nintended victim may resist.”).\\n\\n     (b) Dunston also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\\n\\nsupporting the jury’s guilty verdict of felony murder predicated on\\n\\nattempted robbery by force.2 Dunston argues that, at most, the\\n\\nevidence proved misdemeanor theft by taking, and not any form of\\n\\nrobbery or attempted robbery, because any force occurred only after\\n\\nJackson had given Dunston possession of the cash and the phone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     2 Dunston also argues at some length that the evidence was not sufficient\\n\\nto find him guilty of the other two felony-murder counts. But these arguments\\nare moot because those two counts were vacated by operation of law. See\\nKimbro v. State, 317 Ga. 442, 444 (2) n.5 (893 SE2d 678) (2023).\\n                                     13\\n “Georgia follows the general rule that the force or intimidation\\n\\nessential to a robbery can either precede the taking or occur\\n\\ncontemporaneously with it.” Doctor v. State, 275 Ga. 612, 613 (2)\\n\\n(571 SE2d 347) (2002), overruled on other grounds by Jones v. State,\\n\\n279 Ga. 854, 858 (3) (622 SE2d 1) (2005). See also Perez, 316 Ga. at\\n\\n438 (2). In this case, in addition to the evidence recounted above, the\\n\\nevidence showed that Dunston rolled up the window just before or\\n\\nas McCabe drove off, from which the jury could infer an attempt to\\n\\nretain Jackson’s cash and cell phone that was contemporaneous with\\n\\nthe use of force – dragging Jackson down the road and shooting him\\n\\n– for that purpose. The jury was authorized to find that force was\\n\\nused against Jackson and he was killed both during and as part of a\\n\\nsubstantial step toward the ultimately unsuccessful taking of his\\n\\nproperty by force. See Vergara v. State, 287 Ga. 194, 196-197 (1) (c)\\n\\n(695 SE2d 215) (2010) (affirming an armed robbery conviction where\\n\\nthe victim’s cell phone was initially taken with his consent and,\\n\\nregardless of when the intent to take the phone arose, the theft was\\n\\nnot completed until force was employed against the victim to divest\\n\\n                                  14\\n him of legal possession of the phone by preventing him from seeking\\n\\nits return). A rational jury therefore could find Dunston guilty\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, at least as a party to the crimes, of felony\\n\\nmurder predicated on attempted robbery by force. See id. at 197 (1).\\n\\n     2. Both McCabe and Dunston contend that the trial court erred\\n\\nby denying their motion for mistrial on the ground that jurors had\\n\\ndiscussed evidence prior to deliberations and expressed fear for their\\n\\nsafety from being on the jury. McCabe separately contends that the\\n\\ntrial court erred by denying his request to strike jurors who had\\n\\nprematurely discussed the evidence and were concerned for their\\n\\nsafety. We reject both contentions.\\n\\n     Near the end of trial, after direct examination of the State’s\\n\\nexpert in criminal street gangs and gang activity, the trial court took\\n\\na brief recess. Just before the recess ended, Juror J.D. submitted a\\n\\nnote informing the trial court that another juror said she had dated\\n\\na Bloods gang member. The trial court and the parties then\\n\\nquestioned all of the jurors individually about conversations among\\n\\nthe jurors during the recess. Juror M.D. admitted saying that she\\n\\n                                  15\\n had dated a Bloods gang member, and she reported that no juror\\n\\nresponded to her comment. Juror J.D. said that some jurors\\n\\ndiscussed being “scared of gangs” and that Juror L.P. said she had\\n\\nrecently requested police to “ride by” her home at night. Juror L.P.\\n\\nconfirmed that she had made the request of police after she left her\\n\\nhouse door unlocked and found it open, and that she told the\\n\\ndispatcher she was serving on a jury, but that she had become\\n\\n“nervous” before the trial and “it’s not necessarily related to the\\n\\ncase.” Juror J.C. said that she did not hear any conversation or say\\n\\nanything pertaining to this case, except that she mentioned she did\\n\\nnot know if the jurors “need witness protection . . . [j]ust with the\\n\\ntalk of the gangs” and that the only response was a “couple” of\\n\\n“smiles.” She denied that she was commenting specifically on gang\\n\\nevidence in this case, but she felt “uncomfortable” about her safety\\n\\nif the case was gang-related. Juror D.C. reported that some jurors\\n\\ntalked about gang terminology and symbols, which were used in the\\n\\nmiddle school she had attended, and that she had an “offhand”\\n\\nthought hoping that no one would see her on the jury and be “out for\\n\\n                                 16\\n revenge.”\\n\\n     Several other jurors generally confirmed the responses of\\n\\nJurors J.D., L.P., J.C., D.C., and M.D. about the conversations\\n\\nduring the recess. All of the jurors who heard any of the\\n\\nconversations, as well as Jurors L.P. and D.C., confirmed that\\n\\nnothing discussed in the jury room would impact their ability to be\\n\\nfair and impartial. All of the jurors who were asked, including Jurors\\n\\nL.P. and J.C., specifically agreed that they would be able to base\\n\\ntheir verdict on the evidence and the law as instructed by the trial\\n\\ncourt. All of the jurors who were asked also agreed that none of the\\n\\njurors discussed the facts of this case and that the mention of gangs\\n\\nin the jury room had nothing to do with the evidence in this case.\\n\\n     Dunston moved for a mistrial because the gang expert’s\\n\\ntestimony “irreparably poisoned” the jurors and caused them to be\\n\\nconcerned for their safety, because they were discussing aspects of\\n\\nthe evidence before being told to deliberate, and because it would be\\n\\n“naïve” to rely on the jurors’ statements that they would not be\\n\\naffected. McCabe joined the motion for mistrial. The prosecutor\\n\\n                                 17\\n responded that the trial court observed the jurors’ demeanor and\\n\\ncould decide whether to believe their statements that they could set\\n\\ntheir concerns and the conversation aside and be fair and impartial.\\n\\nImmediately after the prosecutor’s response, the trial court denied\\n\\nthe motion for mistrial.\\n\\n     The State moved to dismiss Juror M.D. McCabe asked the trial\\n\\ncourt to excuse three additional jurors – Jurors L.P., J.C., and D.C.\\n\\n– if Juror M.D. was excused. When the trial court asked McCabe’s\\n\\ntrial counsel about a particular reason not to remove Juror L.P.,\\n\\nMcCabe’s counsel said, “Okay. Fine then, we’ll go with the other two,\\n\\nJuror [J.C.] and Juror [D.C.]” The trial court discussed Juror L.P.\\n\\nfurther but never ruled on the request to remove her. Dunston also\\n\\nasked the court to excuse Juror J.C. The trial court excused only\\n\\nJuror M.D. The court subsequently denied the motion to remove\\n\\nJuror J.C. after observing she said that two other jurors smiled at\\n\\nher “witness protection” remark and that she could still be a fair and\\n\\nimpartial juror. The court then asked each of the co-defendants’\\n\\ncounsel if he had “any other motions for any of the other jurors,” and\\n\\n                                 18\\n each counsel separately answered in the negative. Before, during,\\n\\nand after the questioning of the jurors and the motion for mistrial,\\n\\nas well as during the rest of trial, the trial court repeatedly\\n\\ninstructed the jury not to discuss the case.\\n\\n     (a) We review the denial of McCabe’s and Dunston’s motion for\\n\\nmistrial for abuse of discretion, “and the trial court’s exercise of its\\n\\ndiscretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless a mistrial is\\n\\nessential to preserve the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” Monroe v.\\n\\nState, 315 Ga. 767, 775 (2) (884 SE2d 906) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). “To set aside a jury verdict solely because of\\n\\nirregular jury conduct, this Court must conclude that the conduct\\n\\nwas so prejudicial that the verdict is inherently lacking in due\\n\\nprocess.” Dixon v. State, 302 Ga. 691, 694 (3) (a) (808 SE2d 696)\\n\\n(2017) (citations and punctuation omitted). “Any juror irregularity\\n\\nthat has the potential to injure a defendant’s due process rights\\n\\ntriggers a presumption of prejudice, and the prosecution must then\\n\\ncarry the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that no\\n\\nharm occurred.” Monroe, 315 Ga. at 775 (2) (citation and\\n\\n                                  19\\n punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     But as we have explained, the type of irregularity that\\n     gives rise to such a presumption of prejudice involves\\n     juror misconduct that has the potential to injure a\\n     defendant’s due process rights, e.g., making an\\n     unauthorized visit to the crime scene and then presenting\\n     the findings to the jury panel; privately discussing the\\n     defendant’s guilt prior to deliberations in violation of the\\n     court’s instructions; or improperly accessing outside news\\n     sources.\\n\\nDixon, 302 Ga. at 695 (3) (a) (citation and punctuation omitted). “To\\n\\nestablish that the juror irregularity was harmless beyond a\\n\\nreasonable doubt, the State must show based on the record evidence\\n\\nthat there is no reasonable possibility that the juror irregularity\\n\\ncontributed to the conviction.” Monroe, 315 Ga. at 776 (2) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     The record in this case shows that the jurors did not discuss\\n\\nthe co-defendants’ guilt or innocence or any particular evidence in\\n\\nthe case, and the trial court implicitly credited the jurors’\\n\\nstatements that neither their conversations nor their general safety\\n\\nconcerns impacted their ability to be fair and impartial and to base\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 20\\n their verdicts on the evidence and the law. 3 See Davis v. State, 306\\n\\nGa. 430, 432-433 (831 SE2d 804) (2019) (“[I]n the absence of explicit\\n\\nfactual and credibility findings by the trial court, we presume\\n\\nimplicit findings were made supporting the trial court’s decision.”).\\n\\nThere is no evidence to the contrary, and the trial court reminded\\n\\nthe jurors not to discuss the case. We therefore are satisfied that the\\n\\njurors’ conversations and safety concerns – even assuming they\\n\\namounted to misconduct triggering a presumption of prejudice –\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 McCabe argues that, under OCGA § 24-6-606 (b) (“Rule 606 (b)”), the\\n\\nquestioning of the jurors about the impact of their improper discussions on\\ntheir verdict was not proper and cannot be relied on. See Ballinger v. Watkins,\\n315 Ga. 369, 380 (2) (b) n.11 (882 SE2d 312) (2022). In relevant part, Rule 606\\n(b) provides that, “[u]pon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict,” although\\njurors may testify about whether they were improperly exposed to “extraneous\\nprejudicial information” or “any outside influence,” they may not testify, nor\\nmay their “statements be received into evidence,” about “the effect of anything\\nupon the jury deliberations or any other juror’s mind or emotions as influencing\\nthe juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict . . . or concerning the juror’s\\nmental processes in connection therewith.” Rule 606 (b) does not apply where,\\nas here, the problem was brought to the trial court’s attention and the jury was\\nquestioned before the verdicts were reached. See United States v. Sotelo, 97\\nF3d 782, 797 (5th Cir. 1996) (Federal “Rule 606 (b) concerns the competence of\\njuror testimony during ‘an inquiry into the validity of a verdict.’ Since the\\nproblem was brought to the court’s attention prior to verdict, 606 (b) does not\\nimpact the availability of juror testimony in resolving the factual issues\\nraised.”); Collins v. State, 308 Ga. 608, 611 (2) (842 SE2d 811) (2020)\\n(“Georgia’s Rule 606 (b) is borrowed from Federal Rule of Evidence 606 and, as\\nsuch, when interpreting its meaning, we are guided by the decisions of federal\\nappeals courts[.]”).\\n                                       21\\n were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and thus did not deprive\\n\\nhim of his right to a fair trial. See Dixon, 302 Ga. at 694-695 (3) (a)\\n\\n(same holding where there was “simply no evidence that the\\n\\nconversation at issue . . . concerned [the appellant’s] guilt or other\\n\\nimpermissible subjects” and, “[i]n any event, after this conversation\\n\\ncame to light, [one] juror was dismissed and the trial court reminded\\n\\nthe jurors that they were not to discuss the case with anyone,\\n\\nincluding each other”); Chenoweth v. State, 281 Ga. 7, 12 (4) (a) (635\\n\\nSE2d 730) (2006) (holding that “the jurors’ answers to the trial\\n\\ncourt’s questions” – that “there had been discussions about the\\n\\nevidence” but “they could put aside those prior discussions and\\n\\ndecide the case based upon all the evidence presented at trial” and\\n\\nthat “no conduct by any of the lawyers, the court, or the defendants\\n\\n. . . would impact their ability to fairly decide the case” – “show that\\n\\nthe jurors’ error in discussing the evidence was not so inherently\\n\\nprejudicial as to require a new trial”); Holcomb v. State, 268 Ga. 100,\\n\\n103 (2) (485 SE2d 192) (1997) (Where a juror’s alleged statement “in\\n\\nviolation of the trial court’s instruction not to discuss the case . . .\\n\\n                                  22\\n did not involve deliberation of the case before the close of evidence,\\n\\nor a situation where one juror attempted to persuade another on any\\n\\nissue in the case . . . , we are satisfied that the juror’s actions, while\\n\\nimproper, were not so prejudicial as to have contributed to the\\n\\nconviction, and were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”). See\\n\\nalso Harris v. State, 314 Ga. 51, 55 (2) (875 SE2d 649) (2022) (OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-6-606 (b) of our current Evidence Code “did not modify our\\n\\nlongstanding substantive legal standards for assessing prejudice” in\\n\\nthe case of juror misconduct). Accordingly, the trial court did not\\n\\nabuse its discretion in denying McCabe’s and Dunston’s motion for\\n\\nmistrial.\\n\\n     (b) McCabe argues that the trial court improperly denied his\\n\\nrequest to remove Jurors L.P, J.C., and D.C. However, McCabe\\n\\nacquiesced in the retention of Juror L.P. when he explained he would\\n\\n“go with the other two.” See Robinson v. State, 299 Ga. 648, 651 (3)\\n\\n(791 SE2d 13) (2016) (The appellant’s contention that the trial court\\n\\nerred by denying his request to remove a juror was not “preserved\\n\\nfor purposes of appeal. Because [the appellant] acquiesced in the\\n\\n                                   23\\n trial court’s action” by responding affirmatively when the trial court\\n\\nasked if he was satisfied with the questioning of the juror, the\\n\\nappellant could not “complain about the trial court’s ruling.”).\\n\\nFurthermore, McCabe never sought or received rulings on his\\n\\nrequests to remove Jurors L.P. and D.C. McCabe has presented no\\n\\nauthority that the issue was sufficiently preserved because, as\\n\\nasserted in his reply brief, the trial court “was not going to grant” or\\n\\n“would have denied” his request. “It is the duty of counsel to obtain\\n\\na ruling on his motions or objections, and failure to do so will result\\n\\nin waiver for purposes of appeal.” Brooks v. State, 309 Ga. 630, 638\\n\\n(3) (847 SE2d 555) (2020) (citation and punctuation omitted). And\\n\\nplain-error review is not available for this issue. See Miller v. State,\\n\\n309 Ga. 549, 552 (2) (847 SE2d 344) (2020). Consequently, the issue\\n\\nof whether Juror L.P. or Juror D.C. should have been removed from\\n\\nthe jury was not preserved for either ordinary appellate review or\\n\\nplain-error review.\\n\\n     We turn then to the trial court’s denial of McCabe’s request to\\n\\nremove Juror J.C. from the jury. “OCGA § 15-12-172 vests the trial\\n\\n                                  24\\n court with broad discretion to replace a juror with an alternate at\\n\\nany point during the proceedings where, among other reasons, it is\\n\\nshown that the juror is unable to perform his or her duty or legal\\n\\ncause exists.” Morrell v. State, 313 Ga. 247, 263 (3) (869 SE2d 447)\\n\\n(2022). “Whether to strike a juror for cause lies within the sound\\n\\ndiscretion of the trial judge, and the trial court’s exercise of that\\n\\ndiscretion will not be set aside absent a manifest abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion.” Jones v. State, 314 Ga. 605, 614 (3) (878 SE2d 505)\\n\\n(2022) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     To excuse for cause a selected juror in a criminal case on\\n     the statutory ground that her ability to be fair and\\n     impartial is substantially impaired, a challenger must\\n     show that the juror holds an opinion of the guilt or\\n     innocence of the defendant that is so fixed and definite\\n     that the juror will not be able to set it aside and decide\\n     the case on the evidence or the court’s charge on the\\n     evidence.\\n\\nMorrell, 313 Ga. at 263 (3) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Although Juror J.C. expressed some concern for her safety, she\\n\\ngenerally denied both that she overheard any conversation among\\n\\nthe jurors or said anything herself pertaining to this case and that\\n\\n\\n                                 25\\n she was commenting specifically on gang evidence in this case. Juror\\n\\nJ.C. specifically affirmed that she did not feel so uncomfortable that\\n\\nshe could not continue to serve as a juror, that she would be able to\\n\\nset aside that feeling and still base her verdict on the evidence and\\n\\nthe law, and that she could make that decision without a concern of\\n\\nwhat might happen after the verdict. Under these circumstances,\\n\\nthe trial court did not manifestly abuse its broad discretion in\\n\\nrefusing to remove Juror J.C. See Morrell, 313 Ga. at 264 (3)\\n\\n(“[A]lthough [a] [j]uror . . . expressed doubts about her ability to\\n\\nremain impartial, she did not express a fixed opinion about [the\\n\\nappellant’s] guilt or innocence.

Dunston contends that the trial court erred by denying his\\n\\nmotion to sever his trial from McCabe’s. We see no abuse of the trial\\n\\ncourt’s discretion.\\n\\n     When two or more defendants are indicted jointly for a\\n     capital felony where the death penalty has been waived,\\n     for a non-capital felony, or for a misdemeanor, the\\n     defendants can be tried together or separately in the\\n     discretion of the trial court. See OCGA § 17-8-4 (a). A trial\\n     court has broad discretion to grant or deny a motion for\\n     severance. When ruling on the motion to sever, a trial\\n     court should consider three factors: (1) the likelihood of\\n     confusion of the evidence and law; (2) the possibility that\\n\\n                                  27\\n      evidence against one defendant may be considered\\n     against the other defendant; and (3) the presence or\\n     absence of antagonistic defenses. To show that severance\\n     is required, the defendant must do more than point to the\\n     presence of antagonistic defenses or the possibility that\\n     he has a better chance of acquittal in a separate trial.\\n     Rather, he must show that a joint trial was so prejudicial\\n     as to amount to a denial of his right to due process.\\n\\nHenderson v. State, 317 Ga. 66, 85 (7) (891 SE2d 884) (2023)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Dunston does not argue the factors of jury confusion or\\n\\nantagonistic defenses. Indeed, the jury was not likely to be confused\\n\\nabout the evidence or the law because both Dunston and McCabe\\n\\n“were charged with the same offenses stemming from the same\\n\\nincident with largely the same evidence[,]” Draughn v. State, 311\\n\\nGa. 378, 387 (5) (858 SE2d 8) (2021), “and the State argued that they\\n\\nacted together in committing the crimes.” Henderson, 317 Ga. at 85\\n\\n(7). “For the same reason, there were no antagonistic defenses at\\n\\ntrial.” Id. In fact, both co-defendants blamed O’Neal for rogue\\n\\nconduct in shooting Jackson.\\n\\n     With respect to the remaining factor – evidence against one\\n\\n\\n                                 28\\n defendant potentially being considered against the other defendant\\n\\n– Dunston argues that he was not charged with a violation of the\\n\\nGeorgia Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, OCGA §§ 16-15-\\n\\n1 to 16-15-11, and that evidence of his gang affiliation would not\\n\\nhave been admissible if he had been tried separately because it had\\n\\nlittle or no probative value. But his gang affiliation was relevant to\\n\\nexplain Dunston’s highly probative Instagram messages that\\n\\nincluded planning of the attempted robbery. Those messages\\n\\ncontained not only slang used by both Bloods gang members and\\n\\nother criminals, but also word usages and spellings that are unique\\n\\nto the Bloods gang and must be explained with reference to their\\n\\ngang context. For example, the letters “k” or “x” were used\\n\\nthroughout the messages to replace “c” to show disrespect to the\\n\\nCrips, and “stain” referred to the rank of Bloods gang members,\\n\\nwhich is obtained by committing crimes. Thus, Dunston’s gang\\n\\naffiliation was a relevant part of explaining the plan and motive for\\n\\nhis criminal conduct. See Blash v. State, 318 Ga. 325, 336 (4) (898\\n\\nSE2d 522) (2024) (holding that the testimony of an expert in “gang\\n\\n                                 29\\n language” explaining the meanings of various words and phrases in\\n\\nthe defendant’s jail phone call recordings was highly probative\\n\\nbecause it helped the jury understand the unfamiliar terminology in\\n\\nthe calls, even though the defendant was not charged with criminal\\n\\nstreet gang activity); Richardson v. State, 308 Ga. 70, 72 (3) & n.5\\n\\n(838 SE2d 759) (2020) (holding that expert testimony about the\\n\\nvernacular of the defendant’s gang, including the replacement of the\\n\\nletter “c” with the letter “x” or “k,” had significant probative value\\n\\nbecause it explained an otherwise largely incomprehensible\\n\\npersonal letter written and sent by the defendant, even though he\\n\\nwas not charged with gang activity); Worthen v. State, 306 Ga. 600,\\n\\n606 (2) (832 SE2d 335) (2019) (“[E]vidence of gang membership may\\n\\nbe relevant to show motive in a gang-related murder case even if the\\n\\ndefendant is not charged under” the Street Gang Act. (citation\\n\\nomitted)). Given the admissibility of Dunston’s gang affiliation to\\n\\nexplain key evidence, as well as the absence of any showing that the\\n\\njury was likely to be confused by the evidence and the law or that\\n\\nthe co-defendants had antagonistic defenses, Dunston has failed to\\n\\n                                 30\\n make a clear showing that his “joint trial was so prejudicial as to\\n\\namount to a denial of his right to due process.” Henderson, 317 Ga.\\n\\nat 86 (7) (citation and punctuation omitted). The trial court therefore\\n\\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying Dunston’s motion to sever.\\n\\n     4.   McCabe    contends    that   his   trial   counsel   provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance in two ways: failing to move\\n\\nto sever his trial from Dunston’s and failing to object to the State’s\\n\\nimproper closing argument. To prevail on a claim of ineffective\\n\\nassistance, a defendant must prove both that the performance of his\\n\\nlawyer was deficient and that he was prejudiced by counsel’s\\n\\ndeficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 687\\n\\n(104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984). To satisfy the deficiency prong\\n\\nof the Strickland test, the defendant “must show that his attorney\\n\\nperformed at trial in an objectively unreasonable way considering\\n\\nall the circumstances and in light of prevailing professional norms.”\\n\\nLofton v. State, 309 Ga. 349, 360 (6) (846 SE2d 57) (2020). “This\\n\\nrequires a defendant to overcome the strong presumption that\\n\\ncounsel’s performance fell within a wide range of reasonable\\n\\n                                  31\\n professional conduct, and that counsel’s decisions were made in the\\n\\nexercise of reasonable professional judgment.” Scott v. State, 306 Ga.\\n\\n417, 419-420 (2) (831 SE2d 813) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). The defendant must also show that the deficient\\n\\nperformance prejudiced the defense, which requires showing that\\n\\n“there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\\n\\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\\n\\ndifferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S. at 694 (III) (B). If a defendant fails\\n\\nto show either deficiency or prejudice, courts need not examine the\\n\\nother prong of the Strickland test. See DeLoach v. State, 308 Ga.\\n\\n283, 287-288 (2) (840 SE2d 396) (2020).\\n\\n     (a) McCabe contends that his trial counsel was deficient in\\n\\nfailing to file a motion to sever primarily because, he argues, it\\n\\nbecame clear that the State intended to introduce prejudicial gang\\n\\nevidence against Dunston that would not have been admissible at a\\n\\nseparate trial of McCabe. We conclude, however, that counsel was\\n\\nnot deficient because the decision not to move for severance was an\\n\\nobjectively reasonable strategy.\\n\\n                                   32\\n      As explained above in Division 3, the evidence of Dunston’s\\n\\ngang affiliation was a relevant part of explaining the messages\\n\\nbetween him and McCabe that showed their plan and motive for the\\n\\nattempted robbery of Jackson. And McCabe has not argued, much\\n\\nless explained how, the probative value of that evidence was\\n\\nsubstantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice under\\n\\nOCGA § 24-4-403. But, even assuming that evidence of Dunston’s\\n\\ngang affiliation would not have been admissible against McCabe had\\n\\nhe been tried separately, there is no clear showing of prejudice to\\n\\nMcCabe in this joint trial given the evidence of his own association\\n\\nwith the Bloods gang, which was admitted to attack the credibility\\n\\nof his statement that he fled the country due to threats from Bloods\\n\\ngang members like Dunston. See Saylor v. State, 316 Ga. 225, 231\\n\\n(2) (887 SE2d 329) (2023) (“Even if some of the evidence related to\\n\\n[the co-defendants’] gang activities would not have been admissible\\n\\nagainst [the appellant] had he been tried separately, there is no\\n\\nclear showing that this evidence prejudiced him given the evidence\\n\\nof [the appellant’s] gang membership.”). The other factors to be\\n\\n                                33\\n considered in addressing a motion to sever, jury confusion and\\n\\nantagonistic defenses, would not have supported a motion to sever\\n\\nfiled by McCabe any more than they supported Dunston’s motion to\\n\\nsever. See Henderson, 317 Ga. at 85-86 (7); Draughn, 311 Ga. at 387\\n\\n(5).\\n\\n       Even if it would have been an abuse of discretion for the trial\\n\\ncourt to deny a motion to sever filed by McCabe, he has nevertheless\\n\\nnot shown that his counsel was deficient. “Whether to seek a\\n\\nseverance is a matter of trial strategy, and trial counsel’s decision in\\n\\nthis respect would constitute deficient performance only if it was so\\n\\nunreasonable that no competent attorney would have made that\\n\\ndecision.” Wells v. State, 307 Ga. 773, 777 (4) (838 SE2d 242) (2020)\\n\\n(citation omitted). McCabe’s counsel testified that he decided not to\\n\\nseek severance because McCabe had given a detailed statement with\\n\\nmany admissions and “if there was somebody else sitting at the table\\n\\nduring the trial,” counsel “could point the finger at that person and\\n\\nthe jury may be more inclined to try to hold one person accountable\\n\\nand then that may end up benefitting Mr. McCabe . . . – to be\\n\\n                                  34\\n acquitted or at least maybe be convicted of some lesser charge.”4 This\\n\\nstrategic decision was not so unreasonable that no competent\\n\\nattorney would have made it. See id. (The failure to file a motion to\\n\\nsever was not objectively unreasonable where “trial counsel testified\\n\\nthat he did not file a motion to sever because he believed that the\\n\\nevidence against [the appellant] was more substantial than the\\n\\nevidence against his co-defendants, the best trial strategy was to\\n\\ndeflect blame on them, and this strategy would work best if the other\\n\\nco-defendants were present.”).\\n\\n     (b) McCabe also complains of his trial counsel’s failure to object\\n\\nto repeated statements in the State’s closing argument that it did\\n\\nnot have to prove McCabe knew that a crime was going to be\\n\\ncommitted, only that he “participated.” McCabe’s counsel was not\\n\\ndeficient in failing to object to this argument.\\n\\n     A prosecutor is granted wide latitude in the conduct of\\n     closing argument.

State, Case No. S24A0117, 2024 WL 1624637, at *6 (4)\\n\\n(b) (Ga., Apr. 16, 2024) (citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     In addition to the statements of which McCabe complains, the\\n\\nprosecutor said, among other things, that the State did not have to\\n\\nprove that the co-defendants knew O’Neal had a gun, “that this was\\n\\ngoing to happen,” or what was “in their minds”; but that the State\\n\\ndid have to “prove their conduct,” prove “that they knowingly\\n\\nparticipated,” and “prove knowledge that a crime was being\\n\\ncommitted and that the person participated in the crime.” We have\\n\\nheld that the State must prove both that “the defendant knew a\\n\\ncrime was being committed” and that “the defendant knowingly and\\n\\nintentionally participated or helped in the crime’s commission[.]”\\n\\nEckman v. State, 274 Ga. 63, 67 (3) (a) (548 SE2d 310) (2001).\\n\\nConsistent with Eckman, a reasonable jury could have understood\\n\\nthe prosecutor in this case to be arguing that, although the State did\\n\\n\\n                                 36\\n have the burden to prove knowing participation in a crime in order\\n\\nto prove each co-defendant’s guilt as a party to the crime, it did not\\n\\nhave to prove knowledge of O’Neal’s possession of a gun, exactly\\n\\nwhat crimes other participants intended, or what specifically was\\n\\ngoing to happen. The prosecutor did not argue that it was\\n\\nunnecessary to prove either co-defendant had an intent to sell\\n\\nmarijuana to Jackson (which was a required element of the\\n\\nconvictions for attempted sale of marijuana) or to rob him (which\\n\\nwas a required element of their convictions for felony murder\\n\\npredicated on attempted robbery by force). Moreover, the prosecutor\\n\\nrepeatedly urged the jurors to “[l]isten carefully” to the trial court’s\\n\\ninstructions on what proof of knowledge and conduct was required.\\n\\nMcCabe’s trial counsel addressed the issue of knowledge in his\\n\\nclosing argument, telling the jurors, among other things, that to find\\n\\nMcCabe guilty of felony murder based on attempted robbery by\\n\\nforce, they must find he “knew and was intending and participated\\n\\nsomehow in this robbery of . . . Jackson”; that McCabe did not know\\n\\nanything about the planned sale of marijuana until it was already\\n\\n                                  37\\n in process; that he “didn’t know about any of this going on”; that the\\n\\nprosecutor, despite her denials, was asking them to assume what\\n\\nMcCabe “was thinking and what he knew”; and that the State had\\n\\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that McCabe “knew what was\\n\\ngoing to happen” and that he participated in it. The trial court had\\n\\ncharged the jury that “[t]he closing arguments are not evidence,”\\n\\nand during the final charge, the trial court gave the full pattern jury\\n\\ninstruction on knowledge.5 See Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions,\\n\\n\\n     5 The trial court charged the jury on knowledge as follows:\\n\\n            Knowledge on the part of the defendant that a crime was\\n      being committed and that the defendant knowingly and\\n      intentionally participated in or helped in the commission of such\\n      crime must be proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n            If you find from the evidence in this case that the defendant\\n      had no knowledge that a crime was being committed or that the\\n      defendant did not knowingly and intentionally commit, participate\\n      or help in the commission of and was not a conspirator in the\\n      alleged offense, then it would be your duty to acquit the defendant.\\n            On the other hand, should you find beyond a reasonable\\n      doubt that the defendant had knowledge that a crime was being\\n      committed and that the defendant knowingly and intentionally\\n      participated or helped in the commission of it, then you would be\\n      authorized to convict the defendant.\\nThis instruction was immediately followed by the pattern charge on guilt by\\nmere association:\\n            A jury is not authorized to find a person who was merely\\n      associated with other persons involved in the commission of a\\n      crime guilty of consent in or concurrence in the commission of the\\n\\n                                     38\\n Vol. II: Criminal Cases, § 1.43.10 (4th ed. 2007, updated Aug. 2020).\\n\\n     Given those instructions, and considering the parties’ closing\\n\\narguments related to the issue of knowledge in their entirety, we\\n\\ncannot conclude that McCabe’s trial counsel was deficient for failing\\n\\nto object to the prosecutor’s statements about knowledge. Even if an\\n\\nobjection might have had some merit, a reasonable lawyer could\\n\\nhave decided to rely on his own closing argument and on the trial\\n\\ncourt’s charge on knowledge, instead of making an objection of\\n\\nquestionable merit. See Faulkner v. State, 295 Ga. 321, 327 (4) (758\\n\\nSE2d 817) (2014) (“A reasonable lawyer might well have decided\\n\\nthat, rather than make an objection of questionable merit, she would\\n\\nrely on her own closing argument . . . and on the trial court’s\\n\\nthorough charge on parties to a crime.”).\\n\\n     5. Dunston contends that the trial court erred in failing to\\n\\ncharge the jury more fully on the law of proximate causation. We\\n\\n\\n\\n      crime[,] unless the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that\\n      such person helped in the actual perpetration of the crime or\\n      participated in the criminal endeavor.\\nSee Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases, § 1.43.31\\n(4th ed. 2007, updated Aug. 2020).\\n                                    39\\n disagree.\\n\\n     Dunston argues that, given the reliance of his defense in large\\n\\npart on the question of whether Jackson’s death was proximately\\n\\ncaused by the criminal conduct alleged in the indictment and the\\n\\nimportance of the jury’s consideration of this factual question, the\\n\\ntrial court should have given the civil pattern jury instruction\\n\\nregarding foreseeability and intervening cause, modified for the\\n\\nfelony-murder context, or, alternatively, an instruction – based on\\n\\nState v. Jackson, 287 Ga. 646, 654 (3) (697 SE2d 757) (2010) – that\\n\\nto “find the defendant guilty of felony murder as charged in this\\n\\nindictment, you must find that the homicide was the reasonably\\n\\nforeseeable result of the criminal conduct alleged, and that there\\n\\nwas no sufficient, independent, and unforeseen intervening cause.”\\n\\nThe trial court denied Dunston’s alternative requests to give those\\n\\ninstructions and instead gave the following charge, to which\\n\\nDunston objected:\\n\\n     In order for a homicide to have been done in the\\n     commission of a felony, there must be some connection\\n     between the felony and the homicide. The homicide must\\n\\n                                40\\n       have been done in carrying out the unlawful act and not\\n      collateral to it. It is not enough that the homicide occurred\\n      soon or presently after the felony was attempted or\\n      committed. There must be such a legal relationship\\n      between the homicide and the felony so as to cause you to\\n      find that the homicide occurred before the felony was at\\n      an end or before any attempt to avoid conviction or arrest\\n      for the felony. The felony must have a legal relationship\\n      to the homicide, be at least concurrent with it in part, and\\n      be a part of it in an actual and material sense. A homicide\\n      is committed in the carrying out of a felony when it is\\n      committed by the accused while engaged in the\\n      performance of any act required for the full execution of\\n      the felony. 6\\n\\nThe trial court also properly defined felony murder for the jury as\\n\\nfollows: “[A] person also commits the crime of murder when, in the\\n\\ncommission of a felony, that person causes the death of another\\n\\nhuman being with or without malice.” And the court instructed the\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 This instruction was the pattern jury charge at the time of Dunston’s\\n\\ntrial. See Wilson, 315 Ga. at 735 (5) n.2; Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions,\\nVol. II: Criminal Cases, § 2.10.30 (4th ed. 2007, updated Jan. 2017). That\\npattern instruction has since been revised. See Suggested Pattern Jury\\nInstructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases, § 2.10.30 (4th ed. 2007, updated Aug.\\n2022) (“You may find the Defendant guilty of felony murder if you believe that\\nhe/she caused the death of another person by committing the felony of\\n__________, regardless of whether he/she intended the death to occur. There\\nmust be some causal connection between the felony and the death. Felony\\nmurder is not established simply because the death occurred at the same time\\nas or shortly after the felony was attempted or committed. The felony must\\nhave directly caused the death or played a substantial and necessary part in\\ncausing the death, regardless of when the death ultimately occurred.”).\\n                                      41\\n jury on the various predicate felonies that Dunston was charged\\n\\nwith.\\n\\n        As Dunston acknowledges, we have affirmed convictions in\\n\\nother cases where the appellant complained of the same instruction,\\n\\nand Dunston has failed to distinguish his case from those prior\\n\\ncases. See Wilson v. State, 315 Ga. 728, 735 (5) (883 SE2d 802) (2023)\\n\\n(holding that, “taken together,” the set of instructions set forth above\\n\\n“adequately informed the jury about the principles of proximate\\n\\ncause” that apply to felony-murder cases); Stafford v.

Howlette was originally\\n\\nadmitted to the Bar in 1998 and worked at the Clayton County District\\n\\nAttorney’s Office from 1998-2000, the Fulton County District\\n\\nAttorney’s Office from 2000-2001, and Shivers & Associates from 2001-\\n\\n2007. He has worked as a paralegal at Bush & Miller, P.C. since 2008,\\n\\nand the record shows that his current employer has been satisfied with\\n\\nhis performance and would recommend him for a position of trust.\\n      In 2008, this Court accepted Howlette’s petition for voluntary\\n\\nsurrender of license, which he filed pursuant to Bar Rule 4-227 (b)\\n\\nprior to the issuance of a formal complaint. In the Matter of Howlette,\\n\\n283 Ga. 83 (656 SE2d 534) (2008). In the opinion accepting Howlette’s\\n\\nvoluntary surrender of his law license, this Court noted that Howlette\\n\\nwas scheduled to plead guilty to the sale of cocaine, the sale of MDMA,\\n\\nand the sale of ketamine, and the resulting convictions would\\n\\nconstitute felonies and violations of Rule 8.4 of Bar Rule 4-102 (d). Id.\\n\\nat 83. The voluntary surrender of Howlette’s license was tantamount\\n\\nto disbarment. Id. Howlette was sentenced under the First Offender\\n\\nAct and subsequently completed all requirements of his probation and\\n\\nwas discharged without an adjudication of guilt on May 23, 2016.\\n\\n     Asserting that he has not used illegal drugs since 2007 and that\\n\\nhe has been rehabilitated, Howlette seeks readmission to the State\\n\\nBar of Georgia.      Following review of his application and his\\n\\nappearance at an informal conference, the Board to Determine Fitness\\n\\nof Bar Applicants (the “Fitness Board”) voted to recommend granting\\n\\nHowlette’s application. The application is now before this Court for\\n\\n                                   2\\n final adjudication. See Bar Admission Rules, Part A, Section 10 (e)\\n\\n(“The Supreme Court shall make the final determination regarding\\n\\ncertification of fitness” of attorneys applying for readmission to the\\n\\npractice of law).\\n\\n     In connection with his application for readmission, Howlette filed\\n\\na Statement of Use, wherein he states that he was introduced to\\n\\ncocaine in late 2003 or early 2004 which eventually turned into a\\n\\ndependency upon the drug. However, he states that he sought help\\n\\nfrom professionals and has not used drugs since 2007 and that his\\n\\n“past experiences have helped [him] grow and mature, leading [him]\\n\\nto a point where [he] can confidently affirm [his] commitment to\\n\\nresponsible behavior.”      Howlette also filed a Statement of\\n\\nRehabilitation, in accordance with In re Cason, 249 Ga. 806 (294 SE2d\\n\\n520) (1982), wherein he acknowledged that he “made choices and\\n\\nengaged in behaviors that were contrary to the values and principles\\n\\nof the legal profession” which led to his arrest and disbarment.\\n\\nHowlette states that he has since “undertaken a journey of self-\\n\\nimprovement and      personal growth with a         strong focus on\\n\\n                                  3\\n rehabilitation.” Howlette further states that he has been honest with\\n\\nhis family about his prior drug use; continued his studies of legal\\n\\nethics and professionalism; joined the finance committee and annual\\n\\nretreats of his church; started a non-profit soccer organization with\\n\\nvolunteer coaches and coached soccer at South Fulton Middle School\\n\\nfor several years; worked with the Rena Carter Foundation (to disrupt\\n\\ngenerational poverty); volunteered with several food banks; and is\\n\\ncurrently a board member of the KapEx Foundation, which is a\\n\\nnonprofit organization that raises money for college scholarships and\\n\\npromotes diversity and entrepreneurship.             Howlette has also\\n\\nprioritized his mental health by seeking counseling from his Narcotics\\n\\nAnonymous sponsor, his church clergy, and a life coach to address the\\n\\nissues that contributed to his past behavior and addiction.\\n\\n      Additionally, in connection with his application, Howlette\\n\\nsubmitted letters of recommendation from his life coach and two\\n\\nattorneys,   one   of   which   is   his   current   supervisor.   Each\\n\\n“wholeheartedly” endorses Howlette’s readmission to the Bar. His life\\n\\ncoach states that she has witnessed his “remarkable transformation\\n\\n                                     4\\n and unwavering commitment to personal growth, recovery, and\\n\\ncommunity service” since 2008. His supervisor notes that Howlette is\\n\\na man with “impeccable character and moral standing in our\\n\\ncommunity” who has “dedicated countless hours to community service,\\n\\nnon-profit organizations[,] and volunteer activities.”    She further\\n\\nstates that Howlette “has demonstrated a level of personal growth,\\n\\nresponsibility, and dedication that would make him a valuable asset\\n\\nto the legal profession.” A separate attorney attests to Howlette’s\\n\\n“unwavering commitment to the legal profession and his dedication to\\n\\npersonal growth and rehabilitation.”\\n\\n     As part of its investigation the Fitness Board provided notice and\\n\\nan opportunity for the State Bar to present relevant information;\\n\\nprovided notice to the bar membership and Chief Judges where\\n\\nHowlette had practiced; provided newspaper notice to the public in the\\n\\narea where Howlette had practiced; and sought confirmation from the\\n\\nClient Security Fund that no restitution was due. See Part A, Section\\n\\n10 (d) (1)-(4) of the Rules. The Fitness Board received no responses to\\n\\nthe notices filed in the Daily Report and no responses from the Clayton\\n\\n                                  5\\n or Atlanta Bar Associations or the Chief Judges of the Atlanta or\\n\\nClayton Judicial Circuits. The State Bar responded that there were\\n\\nno grievances pending against Howlette at the time of his disbarment\\n\\nand that the State Bar had no information regarding Howlette’s\\n\\nreputation in the Georgia legal community and no knowledge of his\\n\\nconduct following his disbarment.         The Client Security Fund\\n\\nresponded that Howlette owed it no restitution.\\n\\n     The Fitness Board requested Howlette to submit to a random\\n\\ndrug test, which he passed. After receiving the negative drug test from\\n\\nHowlette, the Fitness Board held an informal conference with him\\n\\nwhere he took full responsibility for his past conduct and described his\\n\\njourney in overcoming his addiction and in reestablishing himself in\\n\\nthe community and as a responsible employee and father.           After\\n\\nconsidering Howlette’s testimony and written submissions, the\\n\\nFitness Board concluded that he had, by clear and convincing\\n\\nevidence, carried his burden of demonstrating rehabilitation and\\n\\nrecommended granting certification of fitness to Howlette for\\n\\nreadmission. See Cason, 249 Ga. at 808-809 (bar admission applicant\\n\\n                                   6\\n bears burden to establish rehabilitation by clear and convincing\\n\\nevidence, and “rehabilitation is the reestablishment of the reputation\\n\\nof a person by his or her restoration to a useful and constructive place\\n\\nin society,” including “[t]he requirement of positive action”).\\n\\n     Upon consideration of the entire record, we agree that Howlette\\n\\nhas shown that he is entitled to be certified as fit to practice law in\\n\\nGeorgia. Accordingly, as it appears that Howlette has satisfied all of\\n\\nthe requirements for approval of his application for certification of\\n\\nfitness, see Bar Admission Rules, Part A, Section 10, this Court hereby\\n\\ngrants Howlette’s application for certification of fitness and orders\\n\\nthat, upon satisfaction of all of the requirements of Part B of the Rules,\\n\\nincluding taking and passing the Georgia Bar Examination, Howlette\\n\\nmay be readmitted as an attorney licensed to practice law in the State\\n\\nof Georgia.\\n\\n     Certification of fitness for readmission granted.

HUBER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n        Appellant Andrew Thomas Huber was convicted of felony\\n\\nmurder predicated on aggravated assault in relation to the shooting\\n\\ndeath of Daniel Raburn.1 On appeal, Huber argues that the evidence\\n\\n\\n\\n        1Raburn died on July 3, 2020. On May 28, 2021, a Laurens County\\ngrand jury indicted Huber, as a party to the crimes, for malice murder (Count\\n1), felony murder predicated on aggravated assault (Count 2), and three counts\\nof aggravated assault against Raburn (Counts 3-5). Huber’s accomplices\\nThomas Wayne Harper and Brandilee Nicole Woodard-Brady were separately\\nindicted on the same charges. Prior to Huber’s trial, Harper was tried and\\nconvicted of voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault, and Woodard-\\nBrady entered a guilty plea to voluntary manslaughter. At a trial from October\\n4 through 7, 2022, a jury found Huber not guilty of malice murder but guilty\\nof all the remaining counts against him. The trial court sentenced Huber to\\nlife in prison without the possibility of parole for felony murder; the aggravated\\nassault counts were merged for sentencing purposes.\\n        Huber filed a timely motion for new trial on October 28, 2022, which was\\nthrice amended by new counsel on May 8, May 31, and June 9, 2023. Following\\na hearing on May 30, 2023, the trial court denied Huber’s motion for new trial,\\nas amended, on August 3, 2023. Huber filed a timely notice of appeal on\\nAugust 24, 2023, and the case was docketed to the term of this Court beginning\\nin December 2023 and thereafter submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n was insufficient to support his felony murder conviction, his trial\\n\\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance on various grounds, and the\\n\\ntrial court committed plain error in instructing the jury on simple\\n\\nassault and voluntary manslaughter. For the reasons that follow,\\n\\nwe affirm.\\n\\n     Viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, the\\n\\nevidence at trial showed that Huber had been friends with Brandilee\\n\\nWoodard-Brady for many years and was temporarily living with her\\n\\nand her fiancé, Raburn. Raburn and Woodard-Brady’s relationship\\n\\nwas “rocky” and “toxic,” and she had previously gotten a temporary\\n\\nprotective order against him but later had it rescinded. Thomas\\n\\nHarper was a mutual friend of Huber and Woodard-Brady, and\\n\\nHarper had also occasionally spent time with Raburn but “didn’t\\n\\nreally know” him. On July 4, 2020, law enforcement officers arrived\\n\\nat Raburn and Woodard-Brady’s house for a welfare check, where\\n\\nofficers found Raburn’s body lying in the yard with multiple\\n\\nlacerations and abrasions and a gunshot wound to the head. Police\\n\\ncontacted Woodard-Brady that same day and questioned her at the\\n\\n                                2\\n police station.\\n\\n     At the interview, Woodard-Brady told police that she “didn’t\\n\\nknow what had happened.” Detectives later questioned Woodard-\\n\\nBrady again at her sister’s house, and at that point, she admitted\\n\\nthat she knew Huber and Harper had beat up Raburn but said “they\\n\\nwasn’t supposed to kill him.” After Woodard-Brady was arrested,\\n\\nshe asked to speak to a detective again, and at that point, she\\n\\nadmitted that she had asked Huber and Harper over to the house to\\n\\n“beat [Raburn’s] a**.” When police arrested Harper, they found a\\n\\ngun at his residence, and Harper admitted at trial that he shot\\n\\nRaburn with it. And when police arrested Huber and processed his\\n\\ncar, they found bloody clothes behind a speaker, and he admitted\\n\\nthat the bloody clothes were the clothes he was wearing when\\n\\nRaburn was shot. DNA analysis revealed that the blood on Huber’s\\n\\nclothes belonged to Raburn.\\n\\n     At trial, Woodard-Brady testified that on July 3, 2020, she and\\n\\nRaburn got into a verbal altercation at their home and he pushed\\n\\nher, so she texted Huber, “[b]eat his a**,” after which, Huber and\\n\\n                                 3\\n Harper came to the house.       According to Woodard-Brady, she\\n\\nremained in the house, but she saw Huber and Harper pull up,\\n\\nheard “noises,” and “figured that [Huber and Harper] were beating\\n\\n[Raburn] up.” She also stated that though she called Huber and\\n\\nHarper over to beat up Raburn, she “wasn’t expecting them to go to\\n\\nthat extreme.” She testified that after the beating, she went outside\\n\\nlong enough to see Raburn laying on the ground and that “I thought\\n\\nhe had just – that he was either knocked out or passed out, I did not\\n\\nknow that he had been shot and killed.” She testified that after\\n\\nHuber and Harper left, she also left and went to a friend’s house to\\n\\nstay the night and that she never checked on Raburn or called 911.\\n\\nAccording to her friend, when Woodard-Brady arrived, Woodard-\\n\\nBrady immediately began drinking tequila from the bottle and\\n\\nasked her friend to punch her in the face so that she had an alibi.\\n\\nWoodard-Brady also admitted on direct examination that she had\\n\\npleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in relation to Raburn’s\\n\\ndeath. On cross-examination, Huber’s counsel elicited testimony\\n\\nfrom Woodard-Brady that she regularly abused alcohol and drugs,\\n\\n                                 4\\n and that her “story changed each time” she talked to the police.\\n\\n     Harper testified that Woodard-Brady never contacted him to\\n\\ncome over and beat up Raburn. According to Harper, when he and\\n\\nHuber arrived at Raburn and Woodard-Brady’s house, Raburn was\\n\\nholding a wrench and Huber got out of the car and “exchanged\\n\\nwords” with Raburn before Raburn told Huber to “get that n****r\\n\\nout of his yard,” which angered Harper, who exited the car. Raburn\\n\\nthen dropped the wrench and “got into an altercation” with Huber,\\n\\nand the two men fought on the ground before Raburn got up,\\n\\n“rushed” Harper, and tackled him, causing Harper’s gun to fall out\\n\\nof his pocket. Harper said that he and Raburn then fought with each\\n\\nother and “tussled over the gun” before Harper gained control of it\\n\\nand shot Raburn as Raburn continued to hurl racial slurs at Harper;\\n\\nHuber then drove Harper away.        Harper further testified that\\n\\nalthough Harper shot Raburn, Harper did not cause any other\\n\\n“lacerations” or “indentations” on Raburn’s head, so Huber must\\n\\nhave caused those injuries.\\n\\n     Huber also testified at trial. According to Huber, on July 3,\\n\\n                                 5\\n Woodard-Brady texted him that Raburn was “acting unusual,” so he\\n\\ntold her he would come by and “check on them.” Huber drove Harper\\n\\nto the house, and they went inside to speak with Woodard-Brady\\n\\nbefore Huber walked back outside to talk to Raburn; Huber\\n\\ndescribed Raburn as “fine.” So, Huber went back inside, where he\\n\\nsaw Woodard-Brady and Harper kissing. Huber and Harper then\\n\\nleft, but later that day, Woodard-Brady called Huber, crying,\\n\\ncausing Huber to drive back to the house with Harper.\\n\\n     According to Huber, when he and Harper arrived back at the\\n\\nhouse, Raburn was sitting in his car drinking a beer, and after he\\n\\nsaw them pull up, he got out of his car while holding a tire iron and\\n\\nat one point, yelled, “[g]et that n****r out of my yard.” Huber and\\n\\nHarper got out of Huber’s car, and a verbal altercation began\\n\\nbetween Harper and Raburn. Harper asked Raburn why he would\\n\\nneed the tire iron, and Raburn said he didn’t and threw it down.\\n\\nHuber testified that after he noticed Raburn and Harper were\\n\\n“getting more heated,” Huber approached Raburn, and Huber and\\n\\nRaburn began “tussl[ing]” and “rolled around in the grass,” as\\n\\n                                 6\\n Raburn was “trying to put [Huber] in a headlock.” Huber said that\\n\\nhe and Raburn “broke apart,” Raburn “calmed down a little bit,” and\\n\\nHuber began to walk away, but as he walked toward his car, Huber\\n\\nheard a “clink” and “froze” because he thought it might be somebody\\n\\ngetting hit with a bottle and it scared him. Huber testified that\\n\\n“[a]fter that, out of my peripheral, I could see that Raburn stumbled\\n\\nfor, like, a second and then he turned around and rushed Harper”\\n\\nand “got Harper on his back.”         According to Huber, “they were\\n\\nstruggling over something in their hands,” and Harper yelled “get\\n\\nhim off of me, get him off of me,” so Huber grabbed Raburn and\\n\\npulled him off Harper. Huber testified that he then walked back to\\n\\nhis car, and that was when he heard a gunshot.2 Harper then ran\\n\\ntoward the car and told Huber to “get the F in the car,” so they both\\n\\ngot in, and Huber drove them away. As Huber drove them away,\\n\\nHarper said “lights out” and told him “the same thing could happen\\n\\nto [Huber].”   Huber dropped Harper off and did not go back to\\n\\nRaburn and Woodard-Brady’s house. Neither Huber, Harper, nor\\n\\n\\n     2 Huber testified that Harper “always toted a gun.”\\n\\n                                     7\\n Woodard-Brady called 911 for help or to report the incident.\\n\\n     A neighbor who was in her home at the time of the incident\\n\\ntestified that she heard voices arguing, including a man yelling\\n\\n“b***h, did you call me a n****r,” followed by a loud noise, then a\\n\\nwoman screaming, and finally a car driving away.\\n\\n     1.   Huber contends that the evidence presented at trial was\\n\\ninsufficient to support his conviction for felony murder predicated\\n\\non aggravated assault. We disagree.\\n\\n      When this Court evaluates the constitutional sufficiency of the\\n\\nevidence, “we review whether the evidence presented at trial, when\\n\\nviewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdicts, enabled the\\n\\njury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the\\n\\ncrimes of which [he] was convicted.” Fitts v. State, \\n312 Ga. 134\\n, 141\\n\\n(3) (\\n859 SE2d 79\\n) (2021) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, \\n443 U.S. 307\\n,\\n\\n319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979)). “This limited\\n\\nreview leaves to the jury the resolution of conflicts in the evidence,\\n\\nthe weight of the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, and\\n\\nreasonable inferences to be made from basic facts to ultimate facts.”\\n\\n                                  8\\n Muse v. State, \\n316 Ga. 639\\n, 647 (2) (\\n889 SE2d 885\\n) (2023) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     “A person commits the offense of murder when, in the\\n\\ncommission of a felony, he or she causes the death of another human\\n\\nbeing irrespective of malice.” OCGA § 16-5-1 (c). “Felony murder\\n\\nrequires only that the defendant possessed the requisite criminal\\n\\nintent to commit the underlying felony — in this case, aggravated\\n\\nassault, which also does not require intent to kill.” Mathews v. State,\\n\\n314 Ga. 360\\n, 365 (1) (\\n877 SE2d 188\\n) (2022) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). Under the relevant part of Georgia’s aggravated assault\\n\\nstatute, “[a] person commits the offense of aggravated assault when\\n\\nhe or she assaults: . . . [w]ith a deadly weapon or with any object,\\n\\ndevice, or instrument which, when used offensively against a person,\\n\\nis likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury.” OCGA §\\n\\n16-5-21 (a) (2).\\n\\n       OCGA § 16-2-20 (a) provides that “[e]very person concerned\\n\\nin the commission of a crime is a party thereto and may be charged\\n\\nwith and convicted of commission of the crime.”          To obtain a\\n\\n                                  9\\n conviction of a person as a party to the crime, the State must prove\\n\\n“that he intentionally aided or abetted in the commission of the\\n\\ncrimes or intentionally advised, encouraged, counseled, or procured\\n\\nsomeone else to commit the crimes.” Frazier v. State, \\n308 Ga. 450\\n,\\n\\n453 (2) (a) (\\n841 SE2d 692\\n) (2020). “Conviction as a party to a crime\\n\\nrequires proof of a common criminal intent, which the jury may infer\\n\\nfrom the defendant’s presence, companionship, and conduct with\\n\\nanother perpetrator before, during, and after the crimes.” Rooks v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 743\\n, 751 (2) (\\n893 SE2d 899\\n) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Thus, to prove Huber guilty of the charge of felony murder\\n\\npredicated on aggravated assault, it was not necessary for the State\\n\\nto prove that he personally hit, kicked, or shot Raburn so long as the\\n\\nState proved that Huber was a party to the crimes. See Scoggins v.\\n\\nState, \\n317 Ga. 832\\n, 836-39 (1) (a)-(b) (\\n896 SE2d 476\\n) (2023) (even\\n\\nwhere evidence did not conclusively establish which of two\\n\\ndefendants shot victim or had a weapon, evidence of a common\\n\\ncriminal intent, including defendant’s presence, companionship, and\\n\\n                                 10\\n conduct before and after the fatal shooting supported conviction as\\n\\na party to the crime of murder).\\n\\n     Here, the evidence showed that Woodard-Brady texted Huber\\n\\nto come “beat [Raburn’s] a**” and that Huber then came to the\\n\\nhouse.   Huber also admitted at trial that Woodard-Brady had\\n\\nrequested Huber to come over and that she was crying, that Huber\\n\\ndrove Harper (whom Huber knew to always carry a gun) to the\\n\\nhouse, and that Huber and Harper both engaged in a physical fight\\n\\nwith Raburn once they arrived. Moreover, Huber admitted that he\\n\\naided Harper during Harper’s fight with Raburn. And after Harper\\n\\nshot and killed Raburn, Huber drove Harper away and never called\\n\\n911. Huber’s clothes were also covered with Raburn’s blood despite\\n\\nHuber’s claim that he was not near Raburn when Harper shot him.\\n\\nThus, the evidence supported Huber’s presence and active\\n\\nparticipation before, during, and after the crimes.\\n\\n     We conclude that this evidence, when viewed in the light most\\n\\nfavorable to the jury’s verdict, was sufficient as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process to support Huber’s conviction for felony\\n\\n                                   11\\n murder predicated on aggravated assault, at least as a party to the\\n\\ncrimes. See, e.g., Harris v. State, \\n312 Ga. 602\\n, 604-05 (2) (\\n864 SE2d\\n\\n31\\n) (2021) (“even if someone else fired the fatal shot, it is clear that\\n\\n[a]ppellant and that individual joined in the attack on the victim,”\\n\\nand the jury was authorized to conclude that appellant was at least\\n\\na party to the crime of felony murder predicated on aggravated\\n\\nassault (citation and punctuation omitted)); Griffin v. State, \\n292 Ga.\\n\\n321\\n, 322 (1) (\\n737 SE2d 682\\n) (2013) (“Although [appellant] argues his\\n\\nadmission that he hit [victim] was insufficient to convict him of\\n\\nfelony murder based on an aggravated assault, there was evidence\\n\\nfrom which the jury was authorized to determine that he either\\n\\ndirectly participated in or was a party to a crime of aggravated\\n\\nassault which caused the death of another.”); Ellis v. State, \\n292 Ga.\\n\\n276\\n, 279 (1) (\\n736 SE2d 412\\n) (2013) (evidence was sufficient to\\n\\nsupport appellant’s conviction as a party to the crime of felony\\n\\nmurder predicated on aggravated assault where “[e]ven if\\n\\n[appellant] did not have the specific intent that [victim] be killed,\\n\\nthe crimes which he did intend were dangerous ones; by their\\n\\n                                  12\\n attendant circumstances, they created a foreseeable risk of death.”\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted)). Accordingly, this enumeration\\n\\nof error fails.\\n\\n      2.    Huber also contends that his trial counsel rendered\\n\\nineffective assistance (a) by failing to request an instruction that in\\n\\nassessing witness credibility, the jury was authorized to consider\\n\\nnegotiated pleas, leniency, or similar matters, or to request an\\n\\ninstruction on impeachment concerning a witness’s bias or motive;\\n\\nand (b) by failing, on his cross-examination of Woodard-Brady, to\\n\\nadduce evidence about the sentence she received in exchange for her\\n\\nguilty plea to voluntary manslaughter, the maximum sentence she\\n\\navoided, and the dismissal of the other counts against her. These\\n\\nclaims fail.\\n\\n      To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\\n\\nHuber must show both that his counsel’s performance was deficient\\n\\nand that such deficiency prejudiced his defense. See Strickland v.\\n\\nWashington, \\n466 U.S. 668\\n, 687 (III) (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674)\\n\\n(1984). To satisfy the deficiency prong, Huber must demonstrate\\n\\n                                  13\\n that his counsel “performed at trial in an objectively unreasonable\\n\\nway considering all the circumstances and in the light of prevailing\\n\\nprofessional norms.” Bacon v. State, \\n316 Ga. 234\\n, 239 (3) (\\n887 SE2d\\n\\n263\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). In doing so, Huber\\n\\nmust overcome “[a] strong presumption . . . that trial counsel’s\\n\\nperformance was reasonable and that counsel’s decisions and\\n\\nchoices at trial fell within the broad range of professional conduct as\\n\\nassessed from counsel’s perspective at the time of trial and under\\n\\nthe specific circumstances of the case.” \\nId.\\n (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). To establish prejudice, Huber “must prove that there is a\\n\\nreasonable probability that, but for his trial counsel’s deficiency, the\\n\\nresult of the trial would have been different.” Bates v. State, \\n313 Ga.\\n\\n57\\n, 62 (2) (\\n867 SE2d 140\\n) (2022). And if Huber fails to make a\\n\\nsufficient showing on either the deficiency or the prejudice prong,\\n\\nwe need not address the other prong. See Washington v. State, \\n313\\n\\nGa. 771\\n, 773 (3) (\\n873 SE2d 132\\n) (2022).\\n\\n     (a)   Failure to Request Jury Instructions. Huber argues that\\n\\nhis trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request\\n\\n                                  14\\n the pattern jury instruction: “In assessing the credibility of a\\n\\nwitness, you may consider any possible motive in testifying, if\\n\\nshown. In that regard, you are authorized to consider any possible\\n\\npending prosecutions, negotiations pleas, grants of immunity or\\n\\nlenience, or similar matters.”      Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury\\n\\nInstructions, Vol. II: Criminal Cases § 1.31.80. Separately, Huber\\n\\nargues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by\\n\\nfailing to request a jury charge on impeachment concerning a\\n\\nwitness’s bias or motive.\\n\\n        But the trial court gave the suggested pattern jury instructions\\n\\non credibility of witnesses; witness, attacked; witness, impeached;\\n\\nprior     statements;   single   witness;   accomplice   corroboration;\\n\\npresumption of innocence; the State’s burden of proof; mere\\n\\npresence; and grave suspicion—including that in deciding witness\\n\\ncredibility, “you may consider all of the facts and circumstances of\\n\\nthe case, including the witnesses’ manner of testifying, their means\\n\\nand opportunity of knowing the facts about which they testify, the\\n\\nnature of the facts about which they testify, the probability or\\n\\n                                    15\\n improbability of a testimony, their interest or lack of interest in the\\n\\noutcome of the case, and their personal creditability [sic] as you\\n\\nobserve it.”    See Suggested Pattern Jury Instruction, Vol. II:\\n\\nCriminal Cases § 1.31.10.        Because we have held that these\\n\\ninstructions adequately covered the concept set out in Pattern\\n\\nInstruction § 1.31.80, the failure to request that charge is not\\n\\ndeficient. See Perkins v. State, \\n313 Ga. 885\\n, 902 (5) (a) (\\n873 SE2d\\n\\n185\\n) (2022) (“[T]he trial court adequately covered [Pattern\\n\\nInstruction § 1.31.80] in the instructions it gave the jury on witness\\n\\ncredibility and impeachment.”). Similarly, we have held that the\\n\\ninstructions given by the trial court sufficiently covered the concept\\n\\nof impeachment by showing bias or motive. See Lee v. State, \\n281 Ga.\\n\\n776\\n, 777-78 (3) (\\n642 SE2d 835\\n) (2007) (trial court’s instruction that\\n\\nthe jury is “the arbiter of each witness’s credibility and that it should\\n\\ngive consideration to each witness’s interest or lack thereof in the\\n\\noutcome of the case . . . adequately covered the possible motive,\\n\\ninterest, or bias of the State’s witnesses,” and therefore “trial\\n\\ncounsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to request\\n\\n                                   16\\n additional instruction”).\\n\\n     Huber argues on appeal that Lee and its progeny should be\\n\\noverruled.     But this argument does not support his ineffective\\n\\nassistance claim since “there is no general duty on the part of\\n\\ndefense counsel to anticipate changes in the law.” Williams v.\\n\\nRudolph, \\n298 Ga. 86\\n, 89 (\\n777 SE2d 472\\n) (2015) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). Accordingly, Huber has not shown that his\\n\\ncounsel was deficient in this respect, and this claim fails.\\n\\n     (b)     Cross-Examination    of    Woodard-Brady.         Huber\\n\\nacknowledges that the jury heard evidence that Woodard-Brady\\n\\npleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter but argues that his trial\\n\\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing, on his cross-\\n\\nexamination of Woodard-Brady, to adduce evidence about the\\n\\nsentence she received in exchange for her guilty plea, the maximum\\n\\nsentence she avoided for murder and three counts of aggravated\\n\\nassault, and the dismissal of those counts, which Huber contends\\n\\nwas relevant to Woodard-Brady’s bias and motive to testify against\\n\\nHuber.\\n\\n                                  17\\n      Pretermitting whether counsel was deficient in failing to elicit\\n\\nthe penalties that Woodard-Brady faced before pleading guilty, we\\n\\nconclude that Huber has not met his burden of demonstrating that\\n\\nhe was prejudiced by the alleged deficiency. The evidence against\\n\\nHuber was strong. Huber admitted at trial that he went over to\\n\\nWoodard-Brady’s house on the day of the murder, that Huber and\\n\\nHarper together fought Raburn, that Harper asked Huber to help\\n\\nhim pull Raburn off him during the fight, and that subsequently\\n\\nHarper shot Raburn. Even though Huber claimed to have walked\\n\\naway and been by his car at the time of the shooting, Raburn’s blood\\n\\nwas found on Huber’s clothes. In contrast, although Woodard-Brady\\n\\nclaimed that she asked Huber to come over to beat Raburn, she also\\n\\ntestified that she did not witness the fight or the shooting.\\n\\n     Also,   counsel   attempted       to   impeach   Woodard-Brady’s\\n\\ncredibility. As recognized by the trial court, the jury heard that\\n\\nWoodard-Brady pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in\\n\\nconnection with her role in the shooting. Moreover, Woodard-Brady\\n\\nacknowledged on direct examination that she “lied by omission,” and\\n\\n                                  18\\n Huber’s trial counsel further cross-examined her on that point by\\n\\nhaving her admit on the stand that her “story changed each time”\\n\\nshe talked to the police.     Given the foregoing, Huber has not\\n\\nestablished a reasonable probability that but for counsel’s failure to\\n\\nfurther impeach Woodard-Brady by eliciting information about the\\n\\npenalties that Woodard-Brady avoided by pleading guilty, the result\\n\\nof his trial would have been different. See, e.g., Benton v. Hines, \\n306\\n\\nGa. 722\\n, 725 (2) (\\n832 SE2d 801\\n) (2019) (counsel’s failure to elicit\\n\\nevidence of witness’s maximum possible sentence did not prejudice\\n\\ndefendant where jury heard other details of witness’s plea deal, and\\n\\nwitness’s testimony was corroborated by other evidence, including\\n\\ndefendant’s own incriminating statement); McCoy v. State, \\n303 Ga.\\n\\n141\\n, 143 (2) (\\n810 SE2d 487\\n) (2018) (“In light of the strong evidence\\n\\nof guilt, there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the\\n\\ntrial would have been different had trial counsel utilized alternative\\n\\nimpeachment evidence.”). This claim therefore fails.\\n\\n     3.   Conceding that his trial counsel did not object to the trial\\n\\ncourt’s jury instructions on simple assault (as an element of\\n\\n                                  19\\n aggravated assault) and voluntary manslaughter, Huber contends\\n\\nthat the trial court plainly erred in its instructions to the jury on\\n\\nthese legal principles. See OCGA § 17-8-58 (b) (“Failure to object in\\n\\naccordance with subsection (a) of this Code section shall preclude\\n\\nappellate review of such portion of the jury charge, unless such\\n\\nportion of the jury charge constitutes plain error which affects\\n\\nsubstantial rights of the parties. Such plain error may be considered\\n\\non appeal even if it was not brought to the court’s attention as\\n\\nprovided in subsection (a) of this Code section.”). Huber’s claims fail.\\n\\n     To show plain error, Huber “must demonstrate that the\\n\\ninstructional error was not affirmatively waived, was obvious\\n\\nbeyond reasonable dispute, likely affected the outcome of the\\n\\nproceedings, and seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public\\n\\nreputation of judicial proceedings. Satisfying all four prongs of this\\n\\nstandard is difficult, as it should be.” Rice v. State, \\n311 Ga. 620\\n, 623\\n\\n(1) (\\n857 SE2d 230\\n) (2021) (citation and punctuation omitted). And\\n\\nthis Court does not have to analyze all elements of the plain-error\\n\\ntest where an appellant fails to establish any one of them. See Lewis\\n\\n                                  20\\n v. State, \\n311 Ga. 650\\n, 665 (4) (\\n859 SE2d 1\\n) (2021).\\n\\n     (a)   Simple assault. As part of its instruction on aggravated\\n\\nassault, the trial court instructed the jury on simple assault, stating:\\n\\n“To prove assault, the State does not have to prove that the other\\n\\nperson was actually injured. However, the State must prove that\\n\\nthe defendant attempted to cause a violent injury to the person\\n\\nand/or committed an act that placed the person in reasonable\\n\\napprehension or fear of immediately receiving a violent injury.”\\n\\nAlthough not entirely clear, Huber seems to argue that based on the\\n\\nallegations of the indictment, the trial court should have only\\n\\ninstructed the jury on simple assault under OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (1),\\n\\nwhich provides that a person commits the offense of simple assault\\n\\nwhen he “[a]ttempts to commit a violent injury to the person of\\n\\nanother,” such that the trial court’s additional charge defining an\\n\\nassault as an action that places “the person in reasonable\\n\\napprehension or fear of immediately receiving a violent injury”\\n\\nmisstated the law.\\n\\n      However, Huber was charged with aggravated assault by\\n\\n                                  21\\n attempting to commit a violent injury in Counts 3 and 4 and with\\n\\naggravated assault by committing an act which places another in\\n\\nreasonable apprehension of receiving a violent injury in Count 5,3\\n\\nso the trial court properly gave the suggested pattern jury\\n\\ninstructions concerning assault based on the allegations and\\n\\nevidence presented in the case. See OCGA § 16-5-20 (a) (“A person\\n\\ncommits the offense of simple assault when he or she either: (1)\\n\\nAttempts to commit a violent injury to the person of another; or (2)\\n\\nCommits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of\\n\\nimmediately receiving a violent injury.”); Georgia Suggested Pattern\\n\\nJury Instruction, Vol. II: Criminal Cases § 2.20.21 (“For aggravated\\n\\nassault, the State must prove that the Defendant: 1. assaulted\\n\\n\\n     3 Regarding the aggravated assault counts of Huber’s indictment, Count\\n\\n3 charged him with “mak[ing] an assault upon the person of Daniel Hugh\\nRaburn with a firearm, a deadly weapon in the manner used, by intentionally\\nshooting said victim in an attempt to commit a violent injury upon said\\nperson”; Count 4 charged Huber with “mak[ing] an assault upon the person of\\nDaniel Hugh Raburn with the hands and feet of said accused, deadly weapons\\nin the manner used, by intentionally striking said victim in an attempt to\\ncommit a violent injury upon said person”; and Count 5 charged Huber with\\n“mak[ing] an assault upon the person of Daniel Hugh Raburn with the hands\\nand feet of said accused, deadly weapons in the manner used, by placing the\\nsaid victim in reasonable apprehension of receiving a violent injury by\\nintentionally striking said victim.”\\n                                    22\\n another person 2.

Huber argues that the jury\\n\\ncharge on voluntary manslaughter was plain error because by\\n\\nreferring only to “the defendant,” the trial court failed to also\\n\\ninstruct the jury that Harper could have been provoked by Raburn’s\\n\\nwords to a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion and if Harper\\n\\nwas so provoked, Huber would have been also because Huber had\\n\\nbeen charged as a party to the crimes.\\n\\n     However, not only did the trial court instruct the jury on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter at Huber’s request, it gave the charge\\n\\nrequested by Huber—which was the suggested pattern jury\\n\\ninstruction and which referred to “the defendant,” rather than\\n\\n                                23\\n “Harper”—verbatim.         See Georgia Suggested Pattern Jury\\n\\nInstruction, Vol. II: Criminal Cases §§ 2.10.40-42. And when an\\n\\nappellant has invited an alleged error, it constitutes an affirmative\\n\\nwaiver under plain-error review, thus providing no basis for\\n\\nreversal. Shank v. State, \\n290 Ga. 844\\n, 845 (2) (\\n725 SE2d 246\\n) (2012);\\n\\nsee also Vasquez v. State, \\n306 Ga. 216\\n, 229 (2) (c) (\\n830 SE2d 143\\n)\\n\\n(2019) (“An affirmative waiver may occur, for example, when a\\n\\ndefendant . . . explicitly requests a jury instruction that he later\\n\\nargues on appeal should not have been given.”); Shaw v. State, \\n292\\n\\nGa. 871\\n, 873 (2) n.3 (\\n742 SE2d 707\\n) (2013) (under plain error review,\\n\\n“reversal is not warranted if the error was invited by the appellant”).\\n\\nHuber’s claim therefore fails at the first prong of the plain error test.\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                   24\\n '),\n",

WHITE v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n      WARREN, Justice.\\n\\n      In February 2018, Erica Claudette White was convicted of\\n\\nmalice murder and other crimes in connection with the November\\n\\n2014 death of her son, Tyrael McFall (“Tyrael”), whom the State\\n\\nalleged died from codeine poisoning. 1 She appeals those convictions,\\n\\n\\n      1 Tyrael died on November 8, 2014.     On August 25, 2017, a Cobb County\\ngrand jury indicted White and her boyfriend, Michael Robert Schullerman, for\\nmalice murder (Count 1), felony murder predicated on aggravated battery\\n(Count 2), aggravated battery (Count 3), making a false statement (Counts 4\\nand 6), identity fraud (Counts 5, 7, and 8), financial-transaction card fraud\\n(Counts 9 through 14), forgery in the second degree (Count 15), and violating\\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, OCGA § 16-14-4 (c)\\n(Count 16). Schullerman pled guilty to Counts 4 through 16 on December 4,\\n2017, and the State dismissed the other charges against him. On February 5,\\n2018, a jury found White guilty on all counts. Regarding Count 16, the jury\\nfound that all but two of 37 overt acts listed in Count 16 constituted a pattern\\nof racketeering activity under OCGA § 16-14-4. On February 7, 2018, the trial\\ncourt sentenced White to serve life in prison without the possibility of parole\\nfor malice murder (Count 1), 5 years in prison for each count of making a false\\nstatement (Counts 4 and 6), 10 years in prison for each count of identity fraud\\n(Counts 5, 7, and 8), 3 years in prison for each count of financial-transaction\\n\\n                                       1\\n contending that the trial court abused its discretion by denying her\\n\\nmotion for new trial on the general grounds; admitting photographs\\n\\nfrom Tyrael’s autopsy; and denying her motion to sever certain\\n\\ncounts in the indictment. White also claims that the trial court erred\\n\\nby denying her general and special demurrers; motion for new trial\\n\\non the grounds that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance\\n\\nof counsel; and motion for new trial on the basis that the State\\n\\ncommitted a Brady violation. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\\n\\n(83 SCt.1194, 10 LEd2d 215) (1963). For the reasons explained\\n\\nbelow, White’s claims fail and we affirm her convictions.\\n\\n      1. As relevant to her claims on appeal, the evidence presented\\n\\nat White’s trial showed the following.           In 2012, White married\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncard fraud (Counts 9 through 14), 5 years in prison for forgery in the second\\ndegree (Count 15), and 20 years in prison for violating the Racketeer\\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Count 16), with Counts 4 through\\n16 to be consecutively served. The felony murder count (Count 2) was vacated\\nby operation of law. The aggravated battery count was merged into Count 1.\\nWhite timely moved for a new trial on February 19, 2018, and then filed an\\namended motion for new trial on May 28, 2021. On September 20, 2023, after\\nan evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied White’s motion for new trial, as\\namended. White timely filed a notice of appeal on September 27, 2023. This\\ncase was docketed to the term of this Court beginning in December 2023 and\\nsubmitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                      2\\n Joseph McFall (“Joseph”), and in August of that year, Tyrael was\\n\\nborn. Only weeks after Tyrael’s birth, Joseph inflicted blunt-force\\n\\ntrauma to Tyrael’s head, causing severe and permanent brain\\n\\ndamage. The injuries prevented Tyrael from learning how to walk\\n\\nand talk. He suffered frequent seizures and received food and\\n\\nmedicine through a feeding tube.          In April 2014, Joseph was\\n\\nconvicted of aggravated battery for this abuse. While Joseph was\\n\\nincarcerated, White became Tyrael’s exclusive caretaker and\\n\\nexpressed in a crime victim-impact statement before a court that\\n\\nTyrael’s condition restricted her ability to travel and work because\\n\\nit “limited . . . what job locations [she could] go to.”\\n\\n     Around that time, White and Michael Schullerman began a\\n\\nromantic relationship. Within a few months, Schullerman moved\\n\\ninto the same house as White and Tyrael in Austell. White and\\n\\nSchullerman shared the tasks involved in caring for Tyrael,\\n\\nincluding preparing and administering his medicines. Part of that\\n\\nprocess included grinding Tyrael’s pills before inserting them into\\n\\nhis feeding tube.\\n\\n                                    3\\n   1. Events Leading Up to Tyrael’s Death\\n\\n     (a) White’s 911 Call Pertaining to Her Own Health.                  On\\n\\nNovember 2, 2014, at 5:56 p.m., Schullerman called 911,\\n\\ncomplaining that White had a 103-degree fever and was having\\n\\ntrouble breathing. Paramedics arrived at White’s home and at 6:12\\n\\np.m. recorded White’s body temperature as 100 degrees. However,\\n\\nwhen White was transported to the emergency room, Dr. Nauman\\n\\nRashid recorded White’s body temperature as 98.8 degrees. Dr.\\n\\nRashid diagnosed White with a urinary tract infection (“UTI”) and\\n\\nprescribed “Tylenol 3” to White, one tablet of which contains 30\\n\\nmilligrams of codeine.\\n\\n     At 11:22 a.m. on the day after White’s emergency room visit,\\n\\nSchullerman’s cell phone called White’s cell phone. Two minutes\\n\\nlater, White, Schullerman, or one of White’s family members2\\n\\nretrieved White’s Tylenol 3 prescription from the pharmacy,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     2 Evidence was presented that White, Schullerman, White’s daughter\\n\\n(Sierra Monroe), and White’s mother retrieved each other’s prescriptions from\\nthe family’s preferred pharmacy.\\n\\n                                     4\\n although the pharmacy did not have a record showing who retrieved\\n\\nit. 3 Whoever retrieved it, however, purported to sign White’s name\\n\\nto satisfy the pharmacy’s electronic-signature requirement.\\n\\n      (b) Tyrael’s Ongoing Medical Difficulties and Death.                On\\n\\nNovember 5—three days after White’s UTI diagnosis—Dr. Joshua\\n\\nChern implanted a nerve stimulator in Tyrael’s neck at Children’s\\n\\nHealthcare of Atlanta to lessen the frequency and mitigate the pain\\n\\nof Tyrael’s seizures. Dr. Chern discharged Tyrael from the hospital\\n\\non the day of the procedure. Tyrael did not receive any codeine from\\n\\nChildren’s Healthcare on November 5, although he was given liquid\\n\\noxycodone to help with pain from the procedure.\\n\\n      On the evening of November 8, White asked her daughter,\\n\\nSierra, and Sierra’s husband to babysit Tyrael while she and\\n\\nSchullerman went to a shooting range where White was a member.\\n\\nAt trial, Sierra testified that, just after she arrived at White’s home\\n\\nat about 7:30 p.m., she saw Schullerman prepare and administer\\n\\n\\n      3 Although White was prescribed Tylenol 3 for the UTI, the pharmacist’s\\n\\ntestimony was unclear as to whether the prescription was filled with Tylenol 3\\nor Tylenol 4. One tablet of Tylenol 4 contains 60 milligrams of codeine.\\n                                      5\\n Tyrael’s medicine while White was nearby.        White encouraged\\n\\nSierra to lie in bed with Tyrael while she and Schullerman were at\\n\\nthe shooting range. White and Schullerman left their home that\\n\\nevening at approximately 8:00 p.m.\\n\\n     When they arrived at the shooting range, White and\\n\\nSchullerman purchased ammunition and targets.          Schullerman\\n\\nlater stated that he and White each shot approximately 50 rounds\\n\\nof ammunition that night.     However, the shooting range owner\\n\\ntestified that she had no record showing that White and\\n\\nSchullerman were placed in a firing lane that night, indicating that\\n\\nthey did not fire any guns during their visit. Although it is unclear\\n\\nexactly what White and Schullerman did while they were at the\\n\\nshooting range, evidence showed that White called Sierra multiple\\n\\ntimes to ask if she had checked on Tyrael. White and Schullerman\\n\\nreturned home at around 9:30 p.m. that evening and Sierra and her\\n\\nhusband left at approximately 10:00 p.m.\\n\\n     At 10:44 p.m., White called 911, yelling that “[her] baby’s not\\n\\nbreathing.” The operator asked, “[I]f I get somebody on the line that\\n\\n                                 6\\n can instruct you in CPR, do you think you could follow the\\n\\ndirections?” White screamed “no” in response. During the 911 call,\\n\\nWhite left Tyrael with Schullerman, ran across the street to her\\n\\nmother’s house, and screamed, “Tyrael’s dead.” EMS arrived at\\n\\n10:49 p.m. Tyrael was pronounced dead at 11:24 p.m., after he had\\n\\nbeen transported to the hospital.\\n\\n     The medical examiner concluded that “codeine toxicity” caused\\n\\nTyrael’s death, and she also reported a small amount of oxycodone\\n\\nin his blood consistent with the oxycodone dosages prescribed after\\n\\nTyrael’s November 5 surgery. At trial, a pharmacokinetics expert\\n\\ntestified that 55 or 56 milligrams of codeine—or two tablets of\\n\\nTylenol 3—could induce respiratory arrest in a child of Tyrael’s size,\\n\\nwith the peak effect of toxicity occurring between 1.5 and 4 hours\\n\\nafter ingestion.\\n\\n     During the investigation into Tyrael’s death, Detective\\n\\nChristoper Payne asked White how codeine could have gotten into\\n\\nTyrael’s body. White stated that she “didn’t know what codeine was\\n\\nuntil this all happened.” She also claimed that “I’ve never had it\\n\\n                                    7\\n prescribed to me” and that she had “no access to it.” “White also told\\n\\nDetective Payne that she had some form of codeine prescribed to her\\n\\nafter Tyrael died, but she did not “have it filled” because she “just\\n\\n[did] not take that kind of stuff.” White did not recall going to the\\n\\nemergency room six days earlier on November 2 and receiving a\\n\\nprescription for Tylenol 3 until Detective Payne specifically asked\\n\\nabout it. White added that she “did not have [that Tylenol 3\\n\\nprescription] filled.” And when Detective Payne asked White if the\\n\\nsignature provided to retrieve that Tylenol 3 prescription was hers,\\n\\nshe—at various times—said that she remembered signing for it and\\n\\ndid not remember signing for it.\\n\\n  2. White’s Trial\\n\\n     The State ultimately charged White and Schullerman with\\n\\nTyrael’s murder, among other crimes. At trial, the State contended\\n\\nthat White and Schullerman poisoned Tyrael with Tylenol 3,\\n\\nalleging that White feigned a UTI and obtained a Tylenol 3\\n\\nprescription under false pretense. To support that contention, Dr.\\n\\nRashid testified that a person’s body temperature could “not likely”\\n\\n                                   8\\n drop 3 degrees in 16 minutes—the period between Schullerman’s\\n\\n911 call and the EMT recording of White’s temperature—“[w]ithout\\n\\nintervention” and “probably [could] not” decrease from 103 to 98.8\\n\\ndegrees     between   the   time   Schullerman     reported   White’s\\n\\ntemperature to the 911 operator and Dr. Rashid’s recording of her\\n\\ntemperature at the emergency room. The State further argued that\\n\\nWhite was motivated to murder Tyrael because she no longer\\n\\nwanted to be encumbered by him—financially, or with respect to the\\n\\naround-the-clock nature of the care that was required for him. To\\n\\nsupport its theory of motive, the State introduced the following\\n\\nevidence.\\n\\n     (a)    Credit-Card-Related    Conduct.   In    August    2014—\\n\\napproximately 3 months before Tyrael died—White used Tyrael’s\\n\\npersonal identifiers to activate a credit card and make transactions\\n\\nusing that card. And in April 2015—approximately 6 months after\\n\\nTyrael died—White used Tyrael’s personal identifying information\\n\\nto activate at least two more credit cards. White and Schullerman\\n\\nused those credit cards to attempt (in some instances) and complete\\n\\n                                   9\\n (in other instances) transactions with several vendors during April\\n\\nand May of 2015. 4\\n\\n      (b) Additional Evidence of Financial Crimes. In 2013, White\\n\\nsecured a $50,000 life insurance policy on Tyrael’s life that she\\n\\nsought to redeem after he died. The State contended that White\\n\\nmade material omissions about Tyrael’s medical condition in\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Count 5 alleged that White and Schullerman committed the offense of\\n\\nidentity fraud, OCGA § 16-9-121, for the “April[] 2014” activation, using\\nTyrael’s identifiers, of a Capital One Bank Mastercard ending in -6266. Count\\n16, overt act 3, incorporated Count 5. Count 16 alleged, in overt acts 35 and\\n36, that White and Schullerman presented the credit card ending in -6266 to\\nmake two purchases, but the card was declined. Count 7 alleged that White\\nand Schullerman committed the offense of identity fraud, OCGA § 16-9-121,\\nfor the April 2015 activation, using Tyrael’s identifiers, of a Citibank card\\nending in -8773. Count 9 alleged that White and Schullerman committed the\\noffense of financial-transaction card fraud, OCGA § 16-9-33 (a) (1) (C), by using\\nthe Citibank card ending in -8773 to purchase electronics at Best Buy. Count\\n16, overt acts 7 and 9, incorporated Counts 7 and 9, respectively. Count 8\\nalleged that White and Schullerman committed the offense of identity fraud,\\nOCGA § 16-9-121, for the April 2015 activation, using Tyrael’s identifiers, of a\\nCapital One Bank credit account ending in -2313. Counts 10 through 14\\nalleged that White and Schullerman committed the offense of financial-\\ntransaction card fraud, OCGA § 16-9-33 (a) (1) (C), for presenting the credit\\ncard ending in -2313 at vendors to make purchases. Count 16, overt acts 6 and\\n8 through 12, incorporated Counts 8 and 10 through 14, respectively.\\nAdditionally, Count 16 alleged, in overt acts 32 through 34 and 37, that White\\nand Schullerman presented the credit card ending in -2313 at vendors to make\\npurchases, but the card was declined. Count 16 also alleged, as overt acts 26\\nthrough 29, that White and Schullerman applied for four other credit cards\\nafter Tyrael’s death using Tyrael’s identifiers, but their applications were\\ndeclined.\\n                                       10\\n applying for that policy, and alleged in the indictment—and\\n\\ncontended at trial—that obtaining this policy was an overt act in\\n\\nfurtherance of White and Schullerman’s scheme to financially\\n\\nexploit Tyrael in death.\\n\\n     In March 2013, White submitted a grant application to the\\n\\nBrain and Spinal Injury Trust Fund Commission, which provides\\n\\ngrants to Georgians who have suffered traumatic brain and spinal\\n\\ncord injuries, in which she falsely represented her total monthly\\n\\nincome. Additionally, in September 2014, White fabricated a letter\\n\\nfrom a former employer that misrepresented her salary to support\\n\\nher application for a $10,000 grant from an entity that supports\\n\\ncrime victims and their caregivers.\\n\\n     Also, two days after Tyrael died in 2014, White made a request\\n\\nwith the Social Security Administration (“SSA”) for Tyrael’s\\n\\nbenefits, for which he was eligible only while living, to be directly\\n\\ndeposited into a different bank account than the bank account they\\n\\nwere deposited into before Tyrael died. However, the SSA did not\\n\\nterminate benefits until the State of Georgia notified it of Tyrael’s\\n\\n                                 11\\n death on May 20, 2015.\\n\\n      (c) Additional Evidence of Motive.              The State presented\\n\\nevidence that White had told Sierra, “since [Sierra] was a child,”5\\n\\nthat she would “smother” a “special-needs child” if she ever had one\\n\\nand then “blame it on a crib death.” And the State also presented\\n\\nevidence that, after White was arrested for Tyrael’s death, Judy\\n\\nJohnson, White’s pod-mate at the Cobb County adult detention\\n\\ncenter, testified that White told fellow inmates that Tyrael “was in\\n\\nthe way of her relationship with her boyfriend,” “she couldn’t have a\\n\\nlife because [Tyrael] needed around-the-clock care,” and that “she\\n\\nshouldn’t have had to put up with something [Tyrael’s] dad did to\\n\\nhim. . . . [I]t was a burden” to her.6\\n\\n\\n      5 Sierra was 21 years old at the time of White’s trial.\\n\\n\\n      6 At trial, additional evidence of White’s statements during her time in\\n\\ncustody was admitted into evidence. In particular, State’s Exhibit 18\\ncontained audio recordings of phone calls White made to family members while\\nshe was in custody at the Cobb County adult detention center, and portions of\\nthose phone calls were played for the jury. State’s Exhibit 18 is not included\\nin the record on appeal; however, neither party disputes its contents. We note\\nthat although the audio recordings contained in State’s Exhibit 18 are not\\ncontained in the record on appeal, the record does contain trial testimony from\\nSierra characterizing her memory of some of the conversations she had with\\n\\n                                       12\\n       Additionally, the State contended that a reason White was\\n\\nmotivated to financially exploit Tyrael was to support a “drug habit.”\\n\\nTo help illustrate that theory, the State presented the testimony of\\n\\na pharmacy technician who said that Schullerman presented her\\n\\nwith a Xanax prescription purporting to be for White. Pharmacy\\n\\nrecords showed that the Xanax prescription was presented after\\n\\nTyrael’s death in May 2015. The pharmacy technician recalled that\\n\\nthe incident caused her concern because there was a discrepancy in\\n\\nthe prescription’s formatting and Schullerman appeared to be\\n\\n“geeked out,” or suffering from withdrawals. The psychiatrist whose\\n\\nprescription pad page Schullerman presented to fill the prescription\\n\\ntestified that he conducted one session with Schullerman in 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhite while White was in custody at the Cobb County adult detention center.\\nAccording to Sierra, White stated on a call to her that when White made calls\\nfrom the detention center to Sierra using other inmates’ phone numbers, that\\nis “when we talk about how [Schullerman] did it.” Sierra further testified that\\n“it” referred to “the fraud,” although the State contested that characterization\\nduring Sierra’s cross-examination. Sierra also testified that she stated on a\\ncall with White that Sierra “[could not] remember if [Schullerman] pushed [the\\nmedicine] through,” although Sierra testified at trial that she was “positive”\\nshe saw Schullerman push medicine through Tyrael’s feeding tube on the night\\nof his death. The record also contains testimony from Detective Payne\\nregarding some of White’s recorded calls to family members from the detention\\ncenter.\\n                                      13\\n When asked if the Xanax prescription was one that he wrote, the\\n\\npsychiatrist explained that “there’s nothing about [the Xanax\\n\\nprescription] that fits . . . with what I would write,” but that\\n\\nSchullerman would have had an opportunity during the session to\\n\\n“rifle through [the psychiatrist’s] stuff” because the psychiatrist\\n\\n“was seeing two patients at the same time in two different rooms.”7\\n\\nAdditionally, to support its contention that White had a “drug\\n\\nhabit,” the State presented evidence that White told Detective\\n\\nPayne that she used cocaine.\\n\\n     White rejected the State’s theory of motive and presented\\n\\nalternative explanations for Tyrael’s death. On the one hand, White\\n\\nclaimed she did not kill Tyrael by mistake or otherwise; she\\n\\ncontended that Schullerman poisoned Tyrael with codeine.                 To\\n\\nsupport that contention, she argued that Schullerman retrieved the\\n\\nTylenol 3 prescription from the pharmacy on November 3 and\\n\\npointed   to   evidence    that    Schullerman      misrepresented      his\\n\\n\\n     7 The State contended that the jury could infer from this evidence that\\n\\nSchullerman stole the psychiatrist’s prescription pad and later used it to\\nfraudulently obtain Xanax.\\n                                    14\\n whereabouts to Detective Payne. White also pointed to Sierra’s\\n\\ntestimony that she saw Schullerman prepare and administer\\n\\nTyrael’s medicine on the night he died.\\n\\n     Alternately, White argued that the medical examiner’s\\n\\npronouncement that “codeine toxicity” caused Tyrael’s death was\\n\\ndoubtful because the State’s toxicologist testified that there was only\\n\\na “toxic”—and not a “fatal”—level of codeine in Tyrael’s blood. In\\n\\nsupport of that theory, White contended that Tyrael’s body had\\n\\n“wore out” because he was having seizures more frequently, and his\\n\\nwhite blood cell count was low.         She also cited the medical\\n\\nexaminer’s testimony that the medical examiner thought—before\\n\\nshe received the toxicology results—that there was a “possibility”\\n\\nthat Tyrael’s body might have “g[iven] up.”\\n\\n     2. White claims that the trial court abused its discretion by\\n\\ndenying her motion for new trial on the “general grounds” set forth\\n\\nin OCGA §§ 5-5-20 and 5-5-21 as to the murder, felony murder, and\\n\\naggravated battery counts (Counts 1 through 3). See Drennon v.\\n\\nState, 314 Ga. 854, 860 (880 SE2d 139) (2022) (“Even when the\\n\\n                                  15\\n evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a conviction, a trial judge\\n\\nmay grant a new trial if the verdict of the jury is ‘contrary to . . . the\\n\\nprinciples of justice and equity,’ OCGA § 5-5-20, or if the verdict is\\n\\n‘decidedly and strongly against the weight of the evidence.’ OCGA §\\n\\n5-5-21.”) (citation and punctuation omitted). We disagree.\\n\\n     When these so-called “general grounds” are properly\\n     raised in a timely motion for new trial, the trial judge\\n     must exercise a broad discretion to sit as a ‘thirteenth\\n     juror.’ . . . [T]he merits of the trial court’s decision on the\\n     general grounds are not subject to our review, and the\\n     decision to grant a new trial on the general grounds is\\n     vested solely in the trial court.\\n\\nKing v. State, 316 Ga. 611, 616 (889 SE2d 851) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). In denying White’s motion for new trial, the\\n\\ntrial court expressly stated that it had “exercised its discretion,\\n\\nweighed the evidence, considered the credibility of witnesses, and\\n\\ndetermined as the ‘thirteenth juror’ that the verdict was not against\\n\\nthe weight of the evidence, and did not offend the principles of justice\\n\\nand equity.” This claim therefore presents nothing for our review.8\\n\\n\\n     8 White does not separately enumerate as error that the evidence for the\\n\\nmurder, felony murder, and aggravated battery counts was insufficient under\\n\\n                                    16\\n King, 316 Ga. at 616.\\n\\n      3. White claims that the trial court abused its discretion by\\n\\nadmitting five pre-incision autopsy photographs of Tyrael’s body\\n\\nbecause they were not relevant under OCGA § 24-4-401 (“Rule 401\\n\\nand unduly prejudicial under OCGA § 24-4-403 (“Rule 403”).\\n\\nWhite’s claim fails.\\n\\n      At trial, White disputed the medical examiner’s conclusion that\\n\\ncodeine poisoning caused Tyrael’s death, contending that other\\n\\nfactors could have contributed to his death, such as his traumatic\\n\\nbrain injury.       The State authenticated autopsy photographs,\\n\\n\\n\\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LEd2d 560) (1979).\\nAlthough we have often reviewed the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of\\nconstitutional due process when an appellant raises a general-grounds claim\\non appeal, see King, 316 Ga. at 616 n.8, many of us question that approach and\\nwould be open to reexamining it in a case where the issue is properly presented.\\nSee id. (“[M]any of us question whether it is proper for this Court to import\\nJackson into an appellate review of the general grounds (or to otherwise rely\\non Jackson as part of that analysis).”); see also Madera v. State, 318 Ga. 593,\\n595 n.2 (899 SE2d 132) (2024) (noting our unease with the practice of importing\\na Jackson analysis into an appellate review of the general grounds); Priester v.\\nState, 317 Ga. 477, 484 n.13 (893 SE2d 751) (2023) (same); Johnson v. State,\\n316 Ga. 672, 682 n.4 (889 SE2d 914) (2023) (same). However, like in King, we\\nneed not determine the correctness of that practice today because the evidence\\nagainst White was constitutionally sufficient to affirm her conviction as to the\\nmalice murder count; the felony murder count was vacated by operation of law;\\nand the aggravated battery count merged into the malice murder count.\\n                                      17\\n contending that the photographs were relevant to upcoming\\n\\ntestimony. On voir dire, an investigator in the medical examiner’s\\n\\noffice conceded that the photographs did not “identif[y] the cause of\\n\\ndeath of Tyrael McFall.” White’s counsel then objected, contending\\n\\nthat that the photographs were “unnecessary and prejudicial.” The\\n\\nState responded that the medical examiner would use the\\n\\nphotographs in her testimony to explain her investigation into\\n\\nTyrael’s cause of death (and she later did). The trial court admitted\\n\\nthe photographs over White’s objection. In its later order denying\\n\\nWhite’s motion for new trial, the trial court explained that the\\n\\nphotographs “were relevant to the issue of [Tyrael’s] cause of death”\\n\\nunder OCGA § 24-4-401 because they “had the tendency to make the\\n\\nexistence of the fact that Tyrael died of codeine poisoning, and not\\n\\nfrom some other injury or abuse, such as smothering, more\\n\\nprobable,” and that it had “weighed the probative value of the five\\n\\nphotos and . . . determined that their value was not substantially\\n\\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice” because “the photos\\n\\nwere not gruesome or of the nature to inflame the jury.” On appeal,\\n\\n                                 18\\n White contends that the photographs were not relevant under Rule\\n\\n401 because they did not prove the cause of Tyrael’s death by\\n\\n“poisoning and not physical injury,” and that their probative value,\\n\\nif any, was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\\n\\nprejudice under Rule 403 because they were “graphic” and “shed no\\n\\nlight on the internal cause of death.” (emphasis in original)\\n\\n      “[W]e    generally    evaluate       the   admissibility of    autopsy\\n\\nphotographs under OCGA §§ 24-4-401, 24-4-402, and 24-4-403.”\\n\\nMitchell v. State, 307 Ga. 855, 863 (838 SE2d 847) (2020) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).9 Important here, “[a]utopsy photographs\\n\\nmay be relevant and probative to show the nature and location of a\\n\\nvictim’s injuries, even if the cause of death is not disputed.” Allen v.\\n\\n\\n      9 Rule 401 defines “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any tendency\\n\\nto make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination\\nof the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the\\nevidence.” Rule 402 provides that “[a]ll relevant evidence shall be admissible,\\nexcept as limited by constitutional requirements or as otherwise provided by\\nlaw or by other rules, as prescribed pursuant to constitutional or statutory\\nauthority, applicable in the court in which the matter is pending. Evidence\\nwhich is not relevant shall not be admissible.” And under Rule 403, “[r]elevant\\nevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\\nthe danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\\nor by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\\ncumulative evidence.”\\n                                      19\\n State, 307 Ga. 707, 710 (838 SE2d 301) (2020). “We review a trial\\n\\ncourt’s evidentiary rulings under an abuse of discretion standard of\\n\\nreview.” Williams v. State, 302 Ga. 474, 478 (807 SE2d 350) (2017)\\n\\n(punctuation and citation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding\\n\\nthat the autopsy photographs were relevant under Rule 401. At\\n\\ntrial, White contested Tyrael’s cause of death by arguing that other\\n\\ntrauma Tyrael experienced—such as the “traumatic brain injury”\\n\\nhis father inflicted on him, and not codeine poisoning—caused his\\n\\ndeath. The record shows that the State addressed White’s argument\\n\\nin part with testimony from the medical examiner, who used the\\n\\nautopsy photographs to explain that her investigation into Tyrael’s\\n\\ncause of death included determining if trauma that could be\\n\\nobserved on an external examination contributed to his death. And\\n\\nthe medical examiner concluded that the minor external injuries she\\n\\nidentified as part of the autopsy—and which she was able to point\\n\\nout to the jury in the photographs—did not contribute to Tyrael’s\\n\\ndeath.   Because the photographs helped the medical examiner\\n\\n                                 20\\n explain her investigation into Tyrael’s cause of death, they made\\n\\n“the existence” of external injuries as the cause of Tyrael’s death\\n\\n“less probable than it would be without the evidence.” See Johnson,\\n\\n316 Ga. at 683 (holding that the trial court did not abuse its\\n\\ndiscretion in admitting five autopsy photographs because they\\n\\n“assisted the medical examiner in describing the nature and severity\\n\\nof [the victim’s] injuries” and “were highly relevant to the issues of\\n\\nboth how and when the injuries were sustained”).\\n\\n     Additionally, White has not established that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the\\n\\nphotographs was not substantially outweighed by the danger of\\n\\nunfair prejudice under Rule 403.        White complains that the\\n\\nphotographs were unfairly prejudicial because they were “graphic.”\\n\\nBut the photographs were neither especially graphic nor gruesome;\\n\\nthey did not depict autopsy incisions, and the medical examiner\\n\\nexplained that the photographs illustrated only minor external\\n\\ntrauma. See Pike v. State, 302 Ga. 795, 799 (809 SE2d 756) (2018)\\n\\n(explaining that the challenged        autopsy photographs       were\\n\\n                                 21\\n admissible under Rule 403 because they did “not depict the victim’s\\n\\nautopsy incisions, and they [were] not especially gory or gruesome\\n\\nin the context of autopsy photographs in a murder case” and that\\n\\n“they were relevant to show the nature and location of the victim’s\\n\\ninjuries,   which   corroborated    the   State’s   evidence   of   the\\n\\ncircumstances of the killing”).     And the probative value of the\\n\\nphotographs was high because they helped the medical examiner\\n\\nexplain how she ruled out other possible causes of death—such as\\n\\ntrauma—instead of codeine poisoning.        Therefore, the probative\\n\\nvalue of the photographs was not substantially outweighed by the\\n\\ndanger of unfair prejudice, if any. See also Johnson, 316 Ga. at 683\\n\\n(“And although the [autopsy] photographs may have been graphic,\\n\\nwe cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that\\n\\ntheir probative value was not substantially outweighed by the\\n\\ndanger of unfair prejudice.”). We therefore cannot say that the trial\\n\\ncourt abused its discretion in admitting the autopsy photographs\\n\\nunder Rule 403.\\n\\n     4. White also claims that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\n                                   22\\n by denying her motion to sever Counts 5 and 7 through 16 from the\\n\\nother charges in the indictment. Prior to trial, White moved to sever\\n\\nCounts 5, 7, and 8 (identity fraud), Counts 9 through 14 (financial-\\n\\ntransaction card fraud), Count 15 (second-degree forgery), and\\n\\nCount 16 (RICO) (collectively, the “financial counts”), from the\\n\\nremaining counts (the “murder counts”). At a pre-trial hearing,\\n\\nWhite contended that the strong evidence supporting the financial\\n\\ncounts—which White’s trial counsel characterized as “all these bad\\n\\nthings about Ms. White”—would unfairly prejudice her with respect\\n\\nto the murder counts. The State responded that each of the financial\\n\\ncounts at issue and listed above was intrinsic to the RICO charge in\\n\\nCount 16 and to the murder counts because they provided a “basis\\n\\nfor the defendant’s motive.” Without making specific findings, the\\n\\ntrial court denied White’s motion from the bench.\\n\\n     “[A] defendant has a right to severance where the offenses are\\n\\njoined solely on the ground that they are of the same or similar\\n\\ncharacter because of the great risk of prejudice from a joint\\n\\ndisposition of unrelated charges.” Carson v. State, 308 Ga. 761, 764-\\n\\n                                 23\\n 765 (843 SE2d 421) (2020) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n“However, where the joinder is based upon the same conduct or on a\\n\\nseries of acts connected together or constituting parts of a single\\n\\nscheme or plan, severance lies within the sound discretion of the\\n\\ntrial judge since the facts in each case are likely to be unique.” Price\\n\\nv. State, 316 Ga. 400, 404 (888 SE2d 469) (2023) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). “[M]ultiple offenses are not joined together\\n\\n‘solely because they are the same or similar character’ if evidence of\\n\\none offense would be admissible at a separate trial for the other.”\\n\\nMcCullum v. State, __ Ga. __, __ (899 SE2d 171, 184) (2024) (citation\\n\\nomitted). “Typically, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in\\n\\ndenying a motion to sever where evidence of one charge would be\\n\\nadmissible in the trial of the other and there is no evidence that the\\n\\njoinder confused or misled the jury.” Id (citation omitted).\\n\\n     (a) No Severance as of Right For Counts 5, 7 Through 14, and\\n     16\\n\\n     To begin, White has not established that she had “an ‘absolute\\n\\nright’ to sever” Counts 5, 7 through 14, and 16 from Counts 1\\n\\n\\n                                  24\\n through 4 and 6 because she has not shown that those “charges\\n\\n[were] joined solely because they [were] of the same or similar\\n\\ncharacter.” McCullum, __ Ga. at __ (899 SE2d at 184) (citation\\n\\nomitted). As the State noted at the pre-trial hearing on White’s\\n\\nmotion to sever, it expected the evidence supporting the financial\\n\\ncounts to demonstrate White’s motive for murdering Tyrael. At\\n\\ntrial, to prove the allegations in Count 5, 7 through 14, and 16, the\\n\\nState introduced documentary evidence obtained from White’s\\n\\ncomputer, email accounts, and credit card statements showing that\\n\\nseveral credit cards were activated using Tyrael’s identifying\\n\\ninformation and that those credit cards were used to conduct\\n\\ntransactions and acquire property. The State showed that each of\\n\\nthese crimes was completed in a 10-month period before and after\\n\\nTyrael’s death and using the identity of her minor child. The State\\n\\nargued that this evidence demonstrated that greed was a motivating\\n\\nfactor in White murdering Tyrael. Because the evidence of Counts\\n\\n5, 7 through 14, and 16 supported the State’s theory of motive—and\\n\\nwere not joined “solely because they are of the same or similar\\n\\n                                 25\\n character”—White has not shown that she had an absolute right to\\n\\nsever. See Doleman v. State, 304 Ga. 740, 744-745 (822 SE2d 223)\\n\\n(2018) (explaining that “a defendant is not entitled to severance\\n\\nwhere a series of similar crimes ‘constituted parts of a single scheme\\n\\nor plan,’ even though acts occurred over a period of more than two\\n\\nweeks”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     (b) The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Declining\\n     to Sever Counts 5, 7 Through 14, and 16\\n\\n        (i) Having concluded that severance of Counts 5, 7 through\\n\\n14, and 16 was not mandatory, we must evaluate whether the trial\\n\\ncourt nonetheless abused its discretion by denying White’s motion\\n\\nto sever. To begin, White has not pointed to any evidence, and we\\n\\nsee none, that the joinder of Counts 5, 7 through 14, and 16\\n\\n“confused or misled the jury.” McCullum, __ Ga. at __ (899 SE2d at\\n\\n184). To the contrary, the verdicts show that the jury “understood\\n\\nthe law and the evidence” specific to this case; for example, it\\n\\nreached the nuanced conclusion that two of the overt acts\\n\\nenumerated in Count 16 (RICO) did not constitute a pattern of\\n\\n\\n                                 26\\n racketeering activity under OCGA § 16-14-3. See, e.g., Carson, 308\\n\\nGa. at 765 (“There is no evidence in this case that the combined trial\\n\\nof the charges confused or misled the jury, and the verdict itself,\\n\\nincluding [the defendant’s] acquittal for [battery], shows that the\\n\\njury fully understood the law and evidence.”).\\n\\n     As to whether evidence related to Counts 5, 7 through 14, and\\n\\n16 would have been admissible in the trial of Counts 1 through 4\\n\\nand 6, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in\\n\\nconcluding that the evidence was relevant, because the evidence lent\\n\\nsupport to the State’s theory that at least part of White’s motive to\\n\\nmurder Tyrael was to financially exploit him. See OCGA § 24-4-401.\\n\\nTo prove the allegations in Counts 5, 7 through 14, and 16, the State\\n\\nintroduced documentary evidence obtained from White’s computer,\\n\\nemail accounts, and credit card statements showing several credit\\n\\ncards were activated using Tyrael’s identifying information and that\\n\\nthose credit cards were used to conduct transactions and acquire\\n\\nproperty. The State argued that each of these crimes was connected\\n\\nto the murder because almost all of them were completed in a 10-\\n\\n                                 27\\n month period before and after Tyrael’s death.10             And the State\\n\\nshowed that White used Tyrael’s identity to perpetrate each of these\\n\\ncrimes, thus enhancing the probative value of those crimes to the\\n\\nprosecution of Tyrael’s murder. The State also introduced evidence\\n\\nthat White omitted material information regarding Tyrael’s medical\\n\\ncondition on a life insurance application for a policy insuring\\n\\nTyrael’s life; collected Tyrael’s Social Security benefit after he died,\\n\\neven    though     the   benefit   terminated     upon Tyrael’s      death;\\n\\nmisrepresented her salary in an application to an entity that\\n\\nadministers financial grants to crime victims and their caregivers,\\n\\nclaiming that Tyrael was such a victim; and falsely represented her\\n\\ntotal monthly income in a grant application to the Brain and Spinal\\n\\nInjury Trust Fund Commission, seeking funds to pay for Tyrael’s\\n\\ntransportation. In addition, the State introduced evidence at trial\\n\\nthat White had stated that Tyrael “needed around-the-clock care”\\n\\nand “was a burden” to her, including because Tyrael’s physical\\n\\n\\n\\n       10 We note that some of the overt acts alleged in Count 16 (RICO) were\\n\\nnot committed within this 10-month window.\\n                                     28\\n condition “limited . . . what job locations [she could] go to”; this\\n\\nallowed the jury to infer that White perceived her financial position\\n\\nto be negatively affected by Tyrael’s ongoing medical needs. The\\n\\nState argued that the foregoing evidence demonstrated that greed\\n\\nwas an important aspect of White’s motivation to murder Tyrael.\\n\\nAnd this evidence made the State’s financial motive argument “more\\n\\nprobable . . . than it would [have been] without the evidence.” See\\n\\nOCGA § 24-4-401.      The trial court therefore did not abuse its\\n\\ndiscretion in concluding that the evidence was relevant and\\n\\nprobative. See id. See also, e.g., Jordan v. State, 313 Ga. 841, 845\\n\\n(874 SE2d 67) (2022) (“Though motive is not an essential element of\\n\\nany offense, evidence of motive is generally relevant in murder\\n\\nprosecutions.”).\\n\\n     As to whether the danger of unfair prejudice substantially\\n\\noutweighed the probative value of the evidence for Counts 5, 7\\n\\nthrough 14, and 16 in a trial on Counts 1 through 4 and 6, see OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-4-403, the trial court’s implicit conclusion that the danger of\\n\\nunfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value\\n\\n                                 29\\n of the evidence was not an abuse of discretion.                Indeed, “the\\n\\nexclusion of evidence under Rule 403 is an extraordinary remedy\\n\\nwhich should be used only sparingly.” Olds v. State, 299 Ga. 65, 70\\n\\n(786 SE2d 633) (2016). As we noted above, the evidence the State\\n\\noffered in support of Counts 5, 7 through 14, and 16 was relevant\\n\\nand probative of the State’s financial-motive theory. And although\\n\\nwe cannot say that the probative value was extremely high, 11 it was\\n\\nnonetheless probative: the State used the evidence from those\\n\\ncounts to argue that White exploited Tyrael for financial gain in life,\\n\\n\\n      11 Specifically, the State’s financial-motive theory appears to have\\nsuffered from a notable weakness: the State did not logically explain why\\nTyrael’s murder was necessary to continue White’s alleged fraud—especially\\nconsidering that White was alleged to have committed extensive fraud against\\nTyrael and others before Tyrael’s death, and that Tyrael’s death terminated at\\nleast some sources of financial support such as Social Security benefits. In\\nother words, it appears that the State did not explain how Tyrael prevented\\nWhite from continuing the pattern of fraud that she allegedly engaged in long\\nbefore Tyrael’s death—reasoning that would have been important to properly\\nestablish motive for his murder. See Harris v. State, 314 Ga. 238, 271-272 (875\\nSE2d 659) (2022) (examining the logical chain of reasoning of the State’s\\nmotive theory in determining the probative value of other acts offered to prove\\nthe appellant’s motive). But even if the State did not show how all of the\\nfinancial crimes were directly connected to or dependent on Tyrael’s death, the\\nfinancial crimes all showed that (at a minimum) White was strongly motivated\\nby money and was willing to exploit her son for financial gain. And that, in\\nturn, could support the State’s narrative that White killed Tyrael for money,\\ntoo.\\n\\n                                      30\\n and then used his death to acquire even more money (such as life\\n\\ninsurance proceeds), to obtain access to additional funds (through\\n\\nadditional credit cards White fraudulently opened or attempted to\\n\\nopen), and to more generally shed what at least one witness testified\\n\\nthat White had characterized as the “burden” associated with caring\\n\\nfor Tyrael.12 And the State had a real need to establish White’s\\n\\nmotive, because White put motive at issue by denying that she killed\\n\\nTyrael (even by mistake), and the evidence in the case involved a\\n\\nsignificant amount of circumstantial evidence. See Harris v. State,\\n\\n314 Ga. 238, 272 (875 SE2d 659) (2022); see also Armstrong v. State,\\n\\n310 Ga. 598, 603 (852 SE2d 824) (2020) (explaining that “the\\n\\nprosecutorial need for the other acts evidence showing gang\\n\\nmembership was high” because, without it, it is unclear what motive\\n\\n[appellant] would have had to shoot [victim] in a crowded park”).\\n\\n     As to the “danger of unfair prejudice” and the “needless\\n\\npresentation of cumulative evidence,” see OCGA § 24-4-403, we\\n\\n\\n     12 From this latter point, the jury would have been authorized to infer\\n\\nthat any purported “burden” in caring for Tyrael would have included a\\nfinancial burden, including for ongoing medical expenses.\\n                                    31\\n acknowledge that the cumulative force of evidence supporting ten\\n\\ncounts of financial crimes, including one count that lists dozens of\\n\\novert acts, could have resulted in prejudice to White insofar as it\\n\\ndepicted her as an unscrupulous person who repeatedly exploited\\n\\nthe people around her—including her disabled son. And there is at\\n\\nleast some chance that given the quantity and nature of these counts\\n\\nand the overt acts alleged in Count 16, the jury could have drawn\\n\\nthe improper inference that if White committed financial crimes\\n\\nagainst her son, she also must have murdered him—which could\\n\\npose a real possibility of unfair prejudice. See, e.g., Harris, 314 Ga.\\n\\nat 263 (“Rule 403’s term ‘unfair prejudice’ speaks to the capacity of\\n\\nsome concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into\\n\\ndeclaring guilt on an improper basis rather than on proof specific to\\n\\nthe offense charged.”) (citation omitted).\\n\\n     But that does not seem likely, given the unique facts and\\n\\ncircumstances of this case.    Indeed, the potential risk of unfair\\n\\nprejudice did not “substantially outweigh[]” the probative value of\\n\\nthe relevant evidence presented at trial. That is especially true given\\n\\n                                  32\\n that the nature of the crimes alleged in Counts 5, 7 through 14, and\\n\\n16 were financial offenses—as opposed to (for example) violent\\n\\ncrimes that may have posed more of a concern for suggesting\\n\\nimproper propensity to murder—and given the evidence presented\\n\\nabout the sequence of events the night Tyrael died that pointed to\\n\\nWhite’s participation in Tyrael’s murder at least as a party to the\\n\\ncrime. In particular, in addition to other circumstantial evidence of\\n\\nWhite’s involvement in Tyrael’s death noted above, Sierra’s\\n\\ntestimony that she saw Schullerman administer Tyrael’s medicine\\n\\nat approximately 7:30 p.m. and evidence that White called 911 at\\n\\n10:44   p.m.—approximately     3    hours   later—aligns   with   the\\n\\npharmacokinetics expert’s testimony that the codeine’s peak toxic\\n\\neffect would have been between 1.5 and 4 hours after ingestion.\\n\\nThat, in turn, would have allowed the jury to infer that Schullerman,\\n\\nWhite, or both, intentionally administered a fatal dose of Tylenol 3\\n\\nor 4 to Tyrael, left Tyrael with Sierra during a planned outing that\\n\\nevidence later suggested was a ruse, called Sierra a number of times\\n\\nto check on Tyrael’s status, and then returned home well after\\n\\n                                   33\\n Tyrael ingested the codeine but seemingly before his death. And the\\n\\njury also heard evidence from which it could have inferred that\\n\\nWhite was not truthful during interviews with Detective Payne\\n\\nregarding her own alleged illness that led to her being prescribed\\n\\nTylenol 3, which contained codeine, in the days before Tyrael’s\\n\\ndeath.\\n\\n         (ii) We acknowledge that at first glance, certain aspects of\\n\\nthis case may make it appear similar to Harris v. State, 314 Ga. 238\\n\\n(875 SE2d 659) (2022), in which this Court reversed a defendant’s\\n\\nconviction for murdering his son based on the trial court’s failure to\\n\\nsever certain sex crimes and the State’s introduction of extensive,\\n\\nimproper “evidence of [the defendant’s] sexual activities,” where the\\n\\nState argued that the evidence was admissible to show the\\n\\ndefendant’s motive and intent (among other things). See Harris, 314\\n\\nGa. at 282-283 (explaining that “[e]xtensive evidence that Appellant\\n\\nwas a man who commits sex crimes against minors – admitted\\n\\nwithout any limitation – likely had a substantial “smear” effect that\\n\\nforced Appellant to proceed at an unfair disadvantage when trying\\n\\n                                  34\\n to defend himself against” a prosecution for the murder of his minor\\n\\nson, which we characterized as being “of an entirely different\\n\\ncharacter”). But a closer examination of that case reveals a number\\n\\nof material differences.\\n\\n     To begin, much of the evidence at issue in Harris was of a more\\n\\ngraphic and inflammatory nature than the evidence supporting the\\n\\nfinancial crimes charged here. In particular, significant amounts of\\n\\nevidence at issue in Harris included (among other things) vulgar\\n\\nsexual messages the defendant sent to minors; lurid photographs of\\n\\nthe defendant’s sex organ that he sent to various women; and\\n\\nevidence that the defendant had hired prostitutes. Id. at 272-280.\\n\\nIn conducting a Rule 403 balancing as to each of these categories of\\n\\nevidence, we described the probative value as “trivial,” “minimally\\n\\nprobative,” and “essentially non-existent,” and characterized the\\n\\nunfair prejudice flowing from that evidence as “extremely high,”\\n\\n“quite high,” and “substantially greater” than the probative value,\\n\\nsuch that the evidence should have been excluded under Rule 403.\\n\\nSee id. In this case, by contrast, the financial-crimes evidence at\\n\\n                                35\\n issue is more closely related to the murder counts than the sexual\\n\\nmisconduct evidence was related to the murder counts in Harris,\\n\\nand was therefore more probative. And, importantly, the evidence\\n\\nof financial crimes presented in this case was less provocative, and\\n\\ntherefore less likely to inflame the jury, than the evidence at issue\\n\\nin Harris, which we concluded “was not relatively benign or merely\\n\\ncumulative.”    Compare, e.g., Harris, 314 Ga. at 272-280, 284\\n\\n(cleaned up).\\n\\n     We also note that the harm posed by the erroneously-admitted\\n\\nevidence in Harris was clearer than the harm White claims here.\\n\\nThat is so in part because of the inflammatory nature of much of the\\n\\nevidence at issue in Harris, and also because the “determination of\\n\\n[the defendant’s] intent was a close question,” which meant that the\\n\\n“high risk of prejudice from [] improperly admitted evidence might\\n\\nbe offset only by the most compelling properly admitted evidence of\\n\\nguilt,” see id. at 284-285—but there, the evidence of intent presented\\n\\nat trial was largely circumstantial and was also conflicting. See id.;\\n\\nsee also id. at 288-289 (“When the State’s properly admitted\\n\\n                                 36\\n evidence is not viewed only positively but rather is balanced against\\n\\nthe evidence elicited by Appellant, the proof of Appellant’s guilt was\\n\\nnot ‘overwhelming,’ ‘compelling, or even strong.’”).        Here, by\\n\\ncontrast, the State introduced more direct evidence of White’s\\n\\nintent, such as Judy Johnson’s testimony of White’s past statements\\n\\nto the effect that White “shouldn’t have had to put up with\\n\\nsomething [Tyrael’s] dad did to him” and that Tyrael was a “burden”\\n\\nto her.\\n\\n     Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court would have\\n\\nabused its discretion under Rule 403 in admitting the evidence of\\n\\nCounts 5, 7 through 14, and 16 in a trial on Counts 1 through 4 and\\n\\n6. And given that conclusion, we cannot say that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion in denying White’s motion to sever. See, e.g.,\\n\\nMcCullum, __ Ga. at __ (899 SE2d at 185) (holding that the trial\\n\\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to sever a\\n\\ncount for the rape of one person from four other counts regarding the\\n\\nrape and murder of another person).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 37\\n      (c) It Is Highly Probable That the Trial Court’s Assumed Error\\n     in Failing to Sever Count 15 Did Not Contribute To the Verdicts\\n\\n     White also contends that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nin declining to sever Count 15, which alleged that White and\\n\\nSchullerman    committed    second-degree    forgery   in   2015   by\\n\\nfabricating a prescription from a psychiatrist for Xanax, from the\\n\\nmurder counts. But even assuming (without deciding) that the trial\\n\\ncourt abused its discretion in denying White’s motion to sever Count\\n\\n15 from the murder counts, any such error was harmless because it\\n\\nis highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdicts.\\n\\nCf. Howell v. State, 307 Ga. 865, 875 (838 SE2d 839) (2020)\\n\\n(standard of appellate review for nonconstitutional harmless error).\\n\\n“In determining whether the error was harmless, we review the\\n\\nrecord de novo and weigh the evidence as we would expect\\n\\nreasonable jurors to have done so.” Jackson v. State, 306 Ga. 69, 80\\n\\n(829 SE2d 142) (2019) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     At trial, the State contended that White’s conduct in helping\\n\\nSchullerman procure a forged Xanax prescription in 2015 tended to\\n\\n\\n                                 38\\n show White’s use of illicit substances.     But other evidence was\\n\\npresented from which the jury could have inferred that White used\\n\\nillicit substances, like cocaine, such that the evidence supporting\\n\\nCount 15 was to some extent cumulative of that other properly-\\n\\nadmitted evidence. And even if the evidence related to Count 15 had\\n\\nbeen excluded, the jury still would have heard evidence of White’s\\n\\nfinancial motive to murder Tyrael—even apart from any alleged use\\n\\nof illicit substances: the alleged identity fraud and financial-\\n\\ntransaction card fraud in Counts 5, 7 through 14, and 16, among\\n\\nother acts of fraud that White previously committed. As a result,\\n\\nthe jury was aware—even without Count 15—that White committed\\n\\nother acts of fraud and that she may have used illicit substances.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, it is highly probable that the trial\\n\\ncourt’s assumed error in declining to sever Count 15 did not\\n\\ncontribute to the verdicts. See, e.g., Kirby v. State, 304 Ga. 472, 481\\n\\n(819 SE2d 468) (2018) (“[T]he jury was already aware that\\n\\n[Appellant] had committed other violent crimes. And any prejudice\\n\\nfrom the evidence that he had committed two other sets of violent\\n\\n                                  39\\n crimes rather than one other set was easily offset by the other\\n\\ncompelling evidence against Appellant[.]”); Hood v. State, 299 Ga.\\n\\n95, 105-106 (786 SE2d 648) (2016) (explaining that erroneous\\n\\nadmission of defendant’s drug-dealing was harmless in part due to\\n\\nproperly admitted evidence that defendant dealt similar drugs\\n\\nunder other circumstances).\\n\\n     5.      White claims that the trial court erred by denying her\\n\\n“Motion to Quash – General and Special Demurrers” regarding\\n\\nCount 16 of the indictment. As discussed above, the State alleged\\n\\nin Count 16 that White and Schullerman violated the Racketeer\\n\\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, OCGA § 16-14-4 (c), by\\n\\nengaging in a scheme that involved murdering Tyrael to obtain\\n\\nmoney and property. Before trial, White generally and specially\\n\\ndemurred as to Count 16, and the trial court denied both. At trial,\\n\\nthe jury found that White was guilty of Count 16, noting on the\\n\\nverdict form that White’s conduct for all but 2 of the 37 overt acts\\n\\nconstituted a pattern of racketeering activity under OCGA § 16-14-\\n\\n3 (4) (A).\\n\\n                                  40\\n      (a) General Demurrer. White contends that the trial court\\n\\nerred in denying her general demurrer because Count 16 failed to\\n\\nallege the elements of the offense and to “state the offense in the\\n\\nterms and language of [OCGA § 17-7-54] or so plainly that the\\n\\nnature of the offense charged may be easily understood by the jury.”\\n\\nOCGA § 17-7-54. The trial court did not err in concluding that Count\\n\\n16 of the indictment was sufficient to withstand White’s general\\n\\ndemurrer.\\n\\n     “A general demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the\\n\\nsubstance of the indictment.” Green v. State, 292 Ga. 451, 451 (738\\n\\nSE2d 582) (2013) (citation and quotation omitted). Consequently,\\n\\n“[o]ur review of the trial court’s ruling does not turn on whether the\\n\\nindictment could have been made clearer or more definite, but most\\n\\nimportantly whether it ‘contains the elements of the offense\\n\\ncharged.’” State v. Mondor, 306 Ga. 338, 341 (830 SE2d 206) (2019)\\n\\n(citation omitted).   But if an indictment “‘fails to allege all the\\n\\nessential elements of the crime or crimes charged,’ including the\\n\\nrequired mens rea, it violates due process, is void, and cannot\\n\\n                                 41\\n withstand a general demurrer.” Mondor, 306 Ga. at 341 (quoting\\n\\nJackson v. State, 301 Ga. 137, 139-140 (800 SE2d 356) (2017)).\\n\\n“Indeed, we have before explained that [t]he true test of the\\n\\nsufficiency of an indictment to withstand a general demurrer is [i]f\\n\\nall the facts which the indictment charges can be admitted, and still\\n\\nthe accused be innocent, the indictment is bad; but if, taking the\\n\\nfacts alleged as premises, the guilt of the accused follows as a legal\\n\\nconclusion, the indictment is good.” Mondor, 306 Ga. at 341 (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). We review a trial court’s ruling on a\\n\\ngeneral demurrer de novo. See Budhani v. State, 306 Ga. 315, 319\\n\\n(830 SE2d 195) (2019).\\n\\n     Here, Count 16 charged White with violating OCGA § 16-14-4\\n\\n(c). The relevant subsections of OCGA § 16-14-4 provide:\\n\\n     (a) It shall be unlawful for any person, through a pattern\\n     of racketeering activity[13] or proceeds derived therefrom,\\n\\n     13 OCGA § 16-14-3 (4) defines “pattern of racketeering activity” as:\\n\\n     (A) Engaging in at least two acts of racketeering activity in\\n     furtherance of one or more incidents, schemes, or transactions that\\n     have the same or similar intents, results, accomplices, victims, or\\n     methods of commission or otherwise are interrelated by\\n     distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated incidents,\\n\\n                                     42\\n to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest\\nin or control of any enterprise, real property, or personal\\nproperty of any nature, including money.\\n\\n(c) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire or\\nendeavor to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a)\\nor (b) of this Code section. A person violates this\\nsubsection when:\\n\\n      (1) He or she together with one or more persons\\n      conspires to violate any of the provisions of\\n      subsection (a) or (b) of this Code section and\\n      any one or more of such persons commits any\\n      overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy;\\n      or\\n\\n      (2) He or she endeavors to violate any of the\\n      provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this Code\\n      section and commits any overt act to effect the\\n      object of the endeavor.\\n\\n\\nprovided at least one of such acts occurred after July 1, 1980, and\\nthat the last of such acts occurred within four years, excluding any\\nperiods of imprisonment, after the commission of a prior act of\\nracketeering activity; or\\n(B) Engaging in any one or more acts of domestic terrorism as\\ndescribed in paragraph (2) of Code Section 16-11-220 or any\\ncriminal attempt, criminal solicitation, or criminal conspiracy\\nrelated thereto.\\n“‘Racketeering activity’ means to commit, to attempt to commit, or\\nto solicit, coerce, or intimidate another person to commit any crime\\nwhich is chargeable by indictment under the laws of this state\\ninvolving[:]” “[f]orgery in any degree in violation of Code Section\\n16-9-1;” “[i]llegal use of financial transaction cards in violation of\\nCode Sections 16-9-31, 16-9-32, 16-9-33, and 16-9-34;” or\\n“[i]dentity fraud in violation of Article 8 of Chapter 9 of this title[,]”\\namong 40 other offenses. OCGA § 16-14-3 (5) (xvi), (xvii), and (xx).\\n                                   43\\n OCGA § 16-14-4 (a), (c).       Count 16 alleged that White and\\n\\nSchullerman “did unlawfully conspire to acquire . . . control of money\\n\\nand personal property through a pattern of racketeering as\\n\\ndescribed in Part I-III [of the indictment] . . . and did commit at\\n\\nleast one overt act in furtherance of said conspiracy.” See OCGA §\\n\\n16-14-4 (a), (c).   The State characterized Part I as a “scheme\\n\\nsummary” that explained how White and Schullerman “conspired\\n\\nand endeavored in a scheme” “to support their lifestyle, their drug\\n\\nhabit, and to obtain a life free of the care of a disabled child,” and\\n\\nlinked the alleged scheme to several alleged overt acts. Part II of\\n\\nthe indictment alleged that White and Schullerman committed\\n\\nidentity fraud against Tyrael, committed financial-transaction card\\n\\nfraud, and murdered Tyrael, and Part III of the indictment alleged\\n\\nthat they did so in furtherance of the scheme alleged in Part I. See\\n\\nOCGA § 16-14-3 (5) (A) (xx) (providing that “racketeering activity”\\n\\nincludes identity fraud); OCGA § 16-14-3 (5) (A) (xvii) (providing\\n\\nthat “racketeering activity” includes “illegal use of financial\\n\\ntransaction cards in violation of” OCGA § 16-9-33); OCGA § 16-14-3\\n\\n                                 44\\n (5) (A) (iv) (providing that “racketeering activity” includes malice\\n\\nmurder). See also OCGA § 16-14-4 (c) (1). And Part III ties Parts I\\n\\nand II together by alleging that:\\n\\n      [t]he overt acts in concert with the scheme . . . constitute\\n      a conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering\\n      activity in that they were committed in furtherance of one\\n      or more . . . schemes or transactions that had the same or\\n      similar intents, results, accomplices, victims or methods\\n      of commission or otherwise were interrelated by\\n      distinguishing characteristics.\\n\\nSee OCGA § 16-14-3 (4) (A). In sum, Count 16 alleged that White\\n\\nand Schullerman committed 37 overt acts, including financial-\\n\\ntransaction card fraud, identity fraud, and the murder of Tyrael, to\\n\\nfurther their scheme of “obtain[ing] money and property” with the\\n\\nobject of “support[ing] their lifestyle, their drug habit, and . . .\\n\\nobtain[ing] a life free of the care of a disabled child.” Because White\\n\\n“cannot admit to the allegations” in Count 16 and “be innocent of the\\n\\ncrime[] for which [s]he was charged,” the trial court did not err in\\n\\ndenying White’s general demurrer.14            Budhani, 306 Ga. at 321\\n\\n\\n      14 Indeed, if White admitted to committing, with Schullerman, any two\\n\\nor more of the overt acts alleged to further a scheme of “obtain[ing] money and\\n\\n                                      45\\n (affirming the denial of a general demurrer because the defendant\\n\\ncould not “admit to the allegations in the indictment and be innocent\\n\\nof the crimes for which he was charged”).\\n\\n      (b) Special Demurrer. White also contends that the trial court\\n\\nerred in denying her special demurrer.                 A special demurrer\\n\\n“challenges the sufficiency of the form of the indictment.”\\n\\nKimbrough v. State, 300 Ga. 878, 880 (799 SE2d 229) (2017) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). “By filing a special demurrer, the accused\\n\\nclaims not that the charge in an indictment is fatally defective and\\n\\nincapable of supporting a conviction (as would be asserted by\\n\\ngeneral demurrer), but rather that the charge is imperfect as to form\\n\\nor that the accused is entitled to more information.” Id. (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted).             “[A]n indictment comports with\\n\\nconstitutional due process and is sufficient to withstand a special\\n\\ndemurrer if it contains the elements of the offense charged,\\n\\nsufficiently informs the defendant of what he must be prepared to\\n\\n\\nproperty” with the object of “support[ing] their lifestyle, their drug habit, and\\n. . . obtain[ing] a life free of the care of a disabled child”—the allegations\\ncontained in Count 16—she would be guilty of violating OCGA § 16-14-4 (c).\\n                                       46\\n defend against, and in the event of another prosecution for the same\\n\\noffense, enables the defendant to determine accurately whether he\\n\\nmay plead a former conviction or acquittal.” Smith v. State, 303 Ga.\\n\\n643, 647 (814 SE2d 411) (2018). “We review a ruling on a special\\n\\ndemurrer de novo to determine the legal sufficiency of the\\n\\nallegations in the indictment.” Hinkson v. State, 310 Ga. 388, 392\\n\\n(850 SE2d 41) (2020) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     White contends that Count 16 should have been quashed based\\n\\non a special demurrer because Part III of Count 16 did not allege (1)\\n\\nwhether the alleged RICO activity was committed in furtherance of\\n\\nan incident, scheme, or transaction; and (2) of which alleged factual\\n\\nincident, scheme, or transaction the alleged racketeering activity is\\n\\nalleged to be in furtherance. See OCGA § 16-14-3 (4). However, the\\n\\ntext of Count 16 belies White’s arguments because Part I of that\\n\\nCount—titled “Scheme Summary”—begins by alleging that White\\n\\nand Schullerman “conspired and endeavored in a scheme to obtain\\n\\nmoney and property.” It then goes on to describe, in detail, the\\n\\nconduct that furthered the alleged scheme, including White and\\n\\n                                 47\\n Schullerman’s procurement of “Tylenol with codeine” to murder\\n\\nTyrael and use of Tyrael’s identity to activate “lines of credit” to pay\\n\\nfor “food, travel, pay pal services, electronics, and other household\\n\\nitems.”   And it ends by previewing “Part II – The Overt Acts,”\\n\\nalleging that after White and Schullerman murdered Tyrael, they\\n\\n“continued their scheme to get money and property by financially\\n\\nexploiting Tyrael in death . . . as enumerated in the overt acts\\n\\nbelow.” Part II then enumerates and describes the 37 overt acts that\\n\\nthe State alleged White and Schullerman committed in furtherance\\n\\nof their criminal scheme. Count 16 thus alleged facts identifying the\\n\\nco-conspirator and the overt acts of racketeering activity that were\\n\\nalleged to “further[]” a “scheme” that “affect[ed] the object of the\\n\\nconspiracy.” OCGA §§ 16-14-3 (4) (A), 16-14-4 (c) (1). Compare\\n\\nKimbrough, 300 Ga. at 882 (explaining that an indictment count\\n\\nalleging a violation of OCGA § 16-14-4 could not survive a special\\n\\ndemurrer because “the indictment fail[ed] to set forth any facts to\\n\\nshow a connection between the enterprise and the racketeering\\n\\nactivity, and the nature of that connection [was] not apparent from\\n\\n                                  48\\n the identification of the enterprise, the general description of the\\n\\nracketeering activity in [the count], or the subsequent counts\\n\\ncharging more particularly the predicate acts of racketeering).\\n\\nAccordingly, White’s arguments fail.\\n\\n      (c) Other Challenges to Count 16 of the Indictment. White also\\n\\nasserts that Parts I and II of Count 16 contained “improper\\n\\ncomments” on her character “in innuendo” that denied her “a fair\\n\\ntrial and due process as protected by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth\\n\\nAmendment[s] to the United States Constitution,” “Art. I, Sec. I,\\n\\nParagraphs I and II of the Georgia Constitution,” and “OCGA § 24-\\n\\n4-404 as to the character of the accused.” 15 White elaborates by\\n\\ncontending that the statements at issue “read[] like a closing\\n\\nargument or opening statement and should not have been submitted\\n\\nto the jury” because they were of the nature of “a continuing witness\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      15 Article I, Section I, Paragraph 1 of the Georgia Constitution of 1983\\n\\nprovides: “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property except by due\\nprocess of law.” Article I, Section I, Paragraph 2 of the Georgia Constitution\\nof 1983 provides: “Protection to person and property is the paramount duty of\\ngovernment and shall be impartial and complete. No person shall be denied\\nthe equal protection of the laws.”\\n                                       49\\n or continuing argument . . . taken into the jury room.” Among\\n\\nothers, White points to the following references as “prejudicial”:\\n\\n“their lifestyle, drug habit and to obtain a life free of the care of a\\n\\ndisabled child;” “meeting co-defendant Schullerman through an\\n\\nonline dating service;” “the two residing together;” and “being\\n\\n‘engaged in a scheme to defraud banks and commercial providers . .\\n\\n. through misappropriation of Tyrael’s identifying information.’”\\n\\n     At trial, White raised these arguments in a filing titled “Motion\\n\\nto Quash – General and Special Demurrers” and raises them on\\n\\nappeal through that lens. We thus review these arguments about\\n\\nspecific allegations contained in Count 16 as part of White’s\\n\\ncomplaint about the denial of her special demurrer.\\n\\n     White has not shown that the trial court erred in denying her\\n\\nspecial demurrer based on her arguments about “improper\\n\\ncomments” on her character.        To begin, “an indictment is not\\n\\nevidence,” Cash v. State, 297 Ga. 859, 863 n.4 (778 SE2d 785) (2015),\\n\\nand the trial court instructed the jury on that point. Moreover, the\\n\\nlanguage of Count 16 accurately described the alleged racketeering\\n\\n                                  50\\n scheme charged by explaining in Part I what the scheme was and\\n\\nthen setting forth the 37 alleged overt acts that White and\\n\\nSchullerman allegedly committed to further that scheme. See, e.g.,\\n\\nMalloy v. State, 293 Ga. 350, 360 (744 SE2d 778) (2013) (holding\\n\\nthat an indictment with an “extensive ‘background’ section” that the\\n\\nappellant contended contained “politically charged, misleading, and\\n\\nprejudicial surplusage likely to diminish the presumption of\\n\\ninnocence to which he is entitled and [was] prejudicial and\\n\\nredundant” survived a special demurrer because “the challenged\\n\\nlanguage accurately described the offenses charged and made the\\n\\ncharges more easily understood” and that “mere surplusage does not\\n\\nvitiate an otherwise valid indictment”). Accordingly, White has not\\n\\nshown that the trial court erred in denying her special demurrer on\\n\\nthese bases.\\n\\n     6.   White   also   contends    that   trial   counsel   provided\\n\\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to (a) adequately\\n\\ninvestigate White’s case; (b) request a jury instruction on\\n\\ninvoluntary manslaughter; (c) object to the virtual testimony of a\\n\\n                                51\\n witness who testified at trial; (d) subpoena and call Schullerman as\\n\\na witness; and (e) call a handwriting expert to testify at trial. For\\n\\nthe following reasons, all of White’s ineffective assistance of counsel\\n\\nclaims fail.\\n\\n      “To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a\\n\\ndefendant generally must show that counsel’s performance was\\n\\ndeficient and that the deficient performance resulted in prejudice to\\n\\nthe defendant.” Perkins v.

White\\n\\ncontends that Schullerman may have possessed exculpatory\\n\\nevidence and that trial counsel never interviewed Schullerman to\\n\\nascertain whether that was so. Trial counsel testified at the motion-\\n\\nfor-new-trial hearing that he asked Schullerman’s counsel if he\\n\\ncould interview Schullerman, but counsel refused the request.\\n\\nSchullerman’s counsel also testified at the motion-for-new-trial\\n\\nhearing and explained that her response to White’s counsel’s request\\n\\nto interview Schullerman was a “hard no.” Trial counsel offered\\n\\nample reasoning at the motion-for-new-trial hearing for declining to\\n\\ncall Schullerman as a witness: Schullerman’s counsel did not permit\\n\\ntrial counsel to interview him before trial, and he therefore could not\\n\\nreasonably estimate what Schullerman’s testimony would be; he\\n\\nthought Schullerman—who pled guilty to the financial counts in the\\n\\nindictment—would be an unhelpful witness, with the State using\\n\\n                                  54\\n Schullerman’s testimony to emphasize White’s participation in the\\n\\nfinancial crimes; and Schullerman could have contradicted trial\\n\\ncounsel’s theory, and Sierra’s testimony, that Schullerman—and not\\n\\nWhite—prepared and administered the fatal dose of codeine to\\n\\nTyrael.\\n\\n     White has not established that trial counsel’s failure to\\n\\ninterview Schullerman constituted deficient performance. Indeed,\\n\\nwe have in other cases concluded that trial counsel did not perform\\n\\ndeficiently when he attempted to interview a potential witness and\\n\\nthe potential witness refused trial counsel’s request. See Atkinson\\n\\nv. State, 301 Ga. 518, 527 (801 SE2d 833) (2017) (explaining that the\\n\\nappellant failed to show trial counsel performed deficiently where\\n\\n“trial counsel did in fact attempt to interview [two witnesses], but\\n\\nthey refused to speak with her”). And that is what happened here.\\n\\nTrial counsel requested an interview with Schullerman before\\n\\nWhite’s trial, but Schullerman’s counsel responded with a “hard no.”\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, White has not shown that trial counsel’s\\n\\nstrategic decision for declining to call Schullerman as a witness was\\n\\n                                 55\\n “so unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made [it]\\n\\nunder similar circumstances.” McDuffie v. State, 298 Ga. 112, 116\\n\\n(779 SE2d 620) (2015) (holding that the appellant failed to\\n\\ndemonstrate that trial counsel’s “strategic decision not to call” a\\n\\npotential witness was “entirely unreasonable” where trial counsel\\n\\nthought that the potential witness would be “more harmful than\\n\\nhelpful”) (citation and punctuation omitted). See also, e.g., Miller v.\\n\\nState, 293 Ga. 638, 639-640 (748 SE2d 893) (2013) (concluding that\\n\\nthe appellant failed to show that trial counsel performed deficiently\\n\\nwhere appellant argued that trial counsel failed to “adequately\\n\\ninvestigate his claim” in part because “counsel tried to interview the\\n\\nState’s witnesses, but several of them refused”).\\n\\n     (b) White claims that trial counsel was ineffective because he\\n\\ndid not request a jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter.\\n\\nThere are two types of involuntary manslaughter under Georgia\\n\\nlaw, and the common element is that the accused “causes the death\\n\\nof another human being without any intention to do so.” OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-5-3.\\n\\n                                  56\\n      Notably, however, White argued at trial that she “never\\n\\nclaimed [Tyrael’s death] was a mistake.” and at the hearing on\\n\\nWhite’s motion for new trial, her counsel testified that she was\\n\\n“adamant” that she did not mistakenly administer Tylenol with\\n\\ncodeine to Tyrael. Trial counsel further explained that he did not\\n\\nrequest an instruction on involuntary manslaughter because “[w]e\\n\\n[we]re denying that she did this at all. . . . To have a lesser or\\n\\ninclude[d] [charge] that somehow says that she did it would have to,\\n\\nin my mind at least, for the jury to consider it, there’s admission that\\n\\nyou did the act, which caused the death of the child.” In denying\\n\\nWhite’s motion for new trial, the trial court found “that trial counsel,\\n\\nper his testimony, made a knowing and strategic decision to not\\n\\nrequest” a charge for involuntary manslaughter because “it did not\\n\\ncomport with [White’s] defense strategy.”\\n\\n     Even assuming, without deciding, that the evidence presented\\n\\nat trial would have authorized an instruction on involuntary\\n\\nmanslaughter, “trial counsel’s decision not to pursue [it] was not so\\n\\nunreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it under\\n\\n                                  57\\n the circumstances.” See, e.g., Lopez, __ Ga. at __ (898 SE2d at 447)\\n\\n(assuming without deciding that the evidence authorized an\\n\\ninvoluntary manslaughter instruction, trial counsel’s decision not to\\n\\npursue that instruction was not deficient performance, because\\n\\n(among other reasons) “[t]rial counsel’s decision to pursue an all-or-\\n\\nnothing defense . . . was consistent with [the appellant’s] interview\\n\\nstatements” and “was not patently unreasonable”). It is well settled\\n\\nthat “‘[d]ecisions about which defenses to present and which jury\\n\\ncharges to request are classic matters of trial strategy, and pursuit\\n\\nof an all-or-nothing defense is generally a permissible strategy.’”\\n\\nGardner v. State, 310 Ga. 515, 519 (852 SE2d 574) (2020) (citation\\n\\nomitted). And the record supports the trial court’s finding that\\n\\ncounsel believed an involuntary manslaughter instruction would\\n\\nhave constituted an “admission that [White] did the act,” and\\n\\ntherefore would have undermined White’s defense that “she did this\\n\\nat all.” Moreover, trial counsel’s testimony shows that he pursued\\n\\nan “all-or-nothing” defense, and that seeking an involuntary-\\n\\nmanslaughter instruction would have been inconsistent with that\\n\\n                                 58\\n defense theory. See, e.g., Velasco v. State, 306 Ga. 888, 893 (834\\n\\nSE2d 21) (2019) (holding that trial counsel did not perform\\n\\ndeficiently by failing to request a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ninstruction, because the appellant maintained during consultations\\n\\nwith counsel and at trial that he acted in self-defense, a theory that\\n\\nis generally inconsistent with a claim of voluntary manslaughter).\\n\\nUnder these circumstances, trial counsel’s decision not to request an\\n\\ninvoluntary manslaughter instruction did not “f[a]ll below a\\n\\nreasonable standard of attorney conduct.” Smith v. State, 301 Ga.\\n\\n348, 353-354 (801 SE2d 18) (2017) (rejecting appellant’s contention\\n\\nthat trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to request an\\n\\ninvoluntary manslaughter instruction where his “‘whole focus’ was\\n\\non a not guilty strategy,” explaining that an “‘all or nothing’ defense\\n\\nis a permissible trial strategy” where trial counsel desires “to avoid\\n\\nadmitting even to any negligent, much less reckless, intent”).\\n\\n     (c) White contends that trial counsel was ineffective on the\\n\\nbasis that he failed to object to a witness’s virtual testimony. Prior\\n\\nto trial, the State moved for the trial court to permit Judy Johnson,\\n\\n                                  59\\n who previously resided with White at the Cobb County Adult\\n\\nDetention Center prior to White’s trial, to testify at trial from\\n\\nMichigan using video-conference technology. At a pretrial hearing,\\n\\nthe State asserted that Johnson needed to testify virtually because\\n\\nher physician ordered her not to travel from her home in Detroit\\n\\nbecause she was pregnant and a cesarean section procedure had\\n\\nalready been scheduled for a time that coincided with White’s trial.\\n\\nTrial counsel responded that he was “not necessarily opposed to live\\n\\ntestimony” via video conference “if that can be accomplished.” Trial\\n\\ncounsel elaborated that “I would want to make sure—if we do this,\\n\\nthere is some direct video as such that she absolutely has to face Ms.\\n\\nWhite. And Ms. White, of course, has the opportunity to confront\\n\\nher. So to that extent, I’m not opposed to taking testimony by video\\n\\nfor health reasons but with some careful guarantees.” The State\\n\\nexplained that its plan was to have Johnson testify via “direct live\\n\\nfeed” from a Michigan courtroom. Trial counsel did not respond\\n\\nfurther.\\n\\n     At trial, Johnson testified via video-conference technology from\\n\\n                                 60\\n a courthouse in Michigan and White did not object to Johnson’s\\n\\ntestimony being offered in this way. Johnson testified that she and\\n\\nWhite previously lived in the same pod at the Cobb County adult\\n\\ndetention center, and that during that time, she heard White explain\\n\\nto other inmates that the hospital gave Tyrael a fatal dose of codeine.\\n\\nWhen some inmates voiced doubts about the plausibility of that\\n\\nstory, White began to sob, telling them that “she shouldn’t have had\\n\\nto put up with something [Tyrael’s] dad did to him and it was a\\n\\nburden to her.” Johnson also testified that White said Tyrael “was\\n\\nin the way of her relationship with her boyfriend because she\\n\\ncouldn’t have a life because he needed around-the-clock care.”\\n\\nWhite’s counsel was given the opportunity to cross-examine Johnson\\n\\nand did so.\\n\\n     At the motion-for-new-trial hearing, trial counsel explained\\n\\nthat he did not object to Johnson’s testimony being provided\\n\\nvirtually because, among other things, he did not want “to be the\\n\\ncause of there being any harm to [Johnson’s] child based on her\\n\\ncoming to testify”; “[he] felt like her testimony was going to be\\n\\n                                  61\\n ridiculous, and she would appear so preposterous that that might be\\n\\nhelpful to [White]”; and “[because] [s]he was virtual, [trial counsel\\n\\nthought] maybe she would look even crazier doing something\\n\\nwherever she was.”\\n\\n     On appeal, White contends that Johnson’s virtual testimony\\n\\nviolated White’s Sixth Amendment right to confront Johnson, a\\n\\nwitness against her, see U.S. Const. Amend. VI, and that trial\\n\\ncounsel’s failure to object to it constituted deficient performance.\\n\\nBut trial counsel’s testimony illustrated how his decision not to\\n\\nobject to Johnson’s virtual testimony was a strategic one.          In\\n\\nparticular, trial counsel did not object to Johnson’s virtual testimony\\n\\nbecause he did not want to cause harm to Johnson, who was under\\n\\nher physician’s orders not to travel from her home in Michigan\\n\\nbefore the birth of her child, and counsel believed that the location\\n\\nfrom which Johnson testified was of little import because he\\n\\nanticipated that Johnson’s testimony might even be helpful to\\n\\nWhite. Moreover, trial counsel rigorously cross-examined Johnson,\\n\\nexposing possible inconsistencies in her testimony and questioning\\n\\n                                  62\\n her credibility.    Under these circumstances, White has not\\n\\ndemonstrated that trial counsel’s decision to not object was so\\n\\nunreasonable    that   “no   competent    attorney,   under   similar\\n\\ncircumstances, would have made it.” Sullivan v. State, 301 Ga. 37,\\n\\n40 (799 SE2d 163) (2017) (explaining that trial counsel was not\\n\\ndeficient for failing to object to alleged “testimonial hearsay in\\n\\nviolation of [appellant’s] Sixth Amendment right to confrontation”\\n\\nbecause it was a strategic decision) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     (d) White contends that trial counsel was ineffective because\\n\\nhe failed to hire and call a handwriting expert to testify at trial to\\n\\ncast doubt on the November 3, 2014 signature provided to retrieve\\n\\nWhite’s Tylenol 3 prescription. The State presented evidence that\\n\\nWhite, Schullerman, and White’s mother regularly picked up each\\n\\nother’s prescriptions from a local pharmacy.      White offered into\\n\\nevidence other signatures that she contended were hers and the\\n\\nsignature purporting to be White’s on the November 3, 2014\\n\\nprescription. Based on apparent discrepancies between the sample\\n\\n                                 63\\n signatures White offered into evidence and the signature associated\\n\\nwith the Tylenol 3 prescription, White’s trial counsel contended in\\n\\nclosing argument that Schullerman—and not White—signed for the\\n\\nNovember 3, 2014 Tylenol 3 prescription. The State then rebutted\\n\\nthat claim by presenting evidence that the November 3, 2014\\n\\nsignature was, in fact, White’s by pointing to Sierra’s earlier\\n\\nidentification of the signature as White’s.16 The State also presented\\n\\nevidence that when Detective Payne asked White if she remembered\\n\\nsigning for the Tylenol 3 prescription, White said that she both\\n\\nremembered signing for it and that she did not sign for it. In the\\n\\nalternative, the State contended that, even if the signature were\\n\\nSchullerman’s, White was aware that Schullerman signed White’s\\n\\nname based on evidence indicating that Schullerman called White\\n\\njust two minutes before he would have retrieved the Tylenol 3\\n\\nprescription from the pharmacy.\\n\\n     At the motion-for-new-trial hearing, White’s counsel procured\\n\\n\\n     16 At trial, Sierra denied the signature was White’s.\\n                                                       However, when\\ncross-examined by the State, she acknowledged that she previously told\\nDetective Payne that the signature was White’s.\\n                                    64\\n a forensic document-examination expert, who testified that the\\n\\nsignature provided to retrieve the Tylenol 3 prescription was\\n\\n“inconsistent” with White’s other handwriting samples. However,\\n\\nthe expert could not rule out the possibility that it was White’s\\n\\nsignature.\\n\\n     Pretermitting whether trial counsel performed deficiently by\\n\\nfailing to present the testimony of a handwriting expert at trial,\\n\\nWhite “has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that the\\n\\nexpert’s testimony would have made a difference in h[er] trial.”\\n\\nParker v. State, 305 Ga. 136, 141 (823 SE2d 313) (2019). Even if\\n\\ntestimony from the motion-for-new-trial expert had been offered at\\n\\ntrial and the jury had credited it, that testimony at best established\\n\\ninconsistency in the signatures; it did not establish that the\\n\\nsignature offered to retrieve the Tylenol 3 prescription could not be\\n\\nWhite’s. Indeed, the motion-for-new-trial expert could not rule out\\n\\nthe possibility that the signature was, in fact, White’s. Moreover,\\n\\nthe jury heard testimony that Sierra had previously identified the\\n\\nNovember 3, 2014 signature to be White’s and would be left to\\n\\n                                 65\\n grapple with the same expert’s testimony that he could not rule out\\n\\nthe possibility that the signature was White’s. And in any event,\\n\\nWhite has not shown that the expert’s testimony would have\\n\\nundercut the State’s alternative theory, backed by evidence, that\\n\\nWhite was engaged in a scheme with Schullerman to sign for and to\\n\\nretrieve the Tylenol 3 prescription under the false pretense of a\\n\\nurinary tract infection. For these reasons, White “has not shown a\\n\\nreasonable probability that the result of [her] trial would have been\\n\\ndifferent had the expert witness testified at trial, [and she] has\\n\\nfailed to establish ineffective assistance.” Graves v. State, 306 Ga.\\n\\n485, 489 (831 SE2d 747) (2019) (explaining that the appellant failed\\n\\nto establish “[a] reasonable probability, that, but for his lawyer’s\\n\\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\\n\\ndifferent” where a purported expert’s testimony at the motion-for-\\n\\nnew-trial hearing failed to “rebut[] the substantial evidence of [the\\n\\nappellant’s] guilt”) (citations omitted). See also Parker, 305 Ga. at\\n\\n141 (holding that the appellant failed to show the requisite prejudice\\n\\nto establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where an\\n\\n                                 66\\n expert’s testimony at the motion-for-new-trial hearing contradicted\\n\\nthe State’s claim but where the appellant was unable to establish a\\n\\nreasonable probability that the expert’s testimony would have made\\n\\na difference at trial).\\n\\n     7. In her final enumeration of error, White claims that the\\n\\nState committed a Brady violation and that this Court should vacate\\n\\nWhite’s convictions and grant a new trial as a result. See Brady v.\\n\\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (83 SCt 1194, 10 LEd2d 215) (1963). For the\\n\\nreasons explained below, White’s claim fails.\\n\\n     At trial, Detective Payne testified that Schullerman stated in\\n\\nan interview that he and White each shot approximately 50 rounds\\n\\nof ammunition at the shooting range on the night Tyrael died. Based\\n\\non that statement, Schullerman and White were indicted for making\\n\\na false statement (Count 4) to which Schullerman pled guilty before\\n\\nWhite’s trial. Count 4 stated in part:\\n\\n     [O]n or about the 10th day of November, 2014,\\n     [Schullerman and White] did knowingly and willfully\\n     make a false statement to Detective Adam Payne . . . to\\n     wit: during an interview arising out of the investigation\\n     into the death of Tyrael McFall, Michael Schullerman did\\n\\n                                 67\\n      falsely state that he had fired a handgun at Governor’s\\n     Gun Club on the evening of November 8, 2014, when\\n     asked about his actions that evening.\\n\\nAs support for Count 4, the State presented evidence from the\\n\\nshooting range’s owner showing that, although White and\\n\\nSchullerman purchased ammunition and targets the evening that\\n\\nTyrael died, there was no record that they ever fired guns that\\n\\nevening.\\n\\n     At White’s motion-for-new-trial hearing, Schullerman’s trial\\n\\ncounsel testified that sometime after Schullerman’s guilty plea but\\n\\nbefore White’s trial began, the State conducted an interview with\\n\\nSchullerman     that    Schullerman’s     lawyer    also    attended.\\n\\nSchullerman’s lawyer testified that Schullerman maintained that\\n\\nhe and White shot guns at the shooting range on the night Tyrael\\n\\ndied, despite having pled guilty to Count 4. Schullerman’s trial\\n\\ncounsel further testified that she recalled having a conversation\\n\\nwith White’s trial counsel after White’s trial concluded where\\n\\nSchullerman’s trial counsel explained that “what [Schullerman] had\\n\\nsaid [in this interview] was different than what he pleaded guilty to”\\n\\n                                 68\\n in Count 4. The State did not disclose Schullerman’s interview\\n\\nstatements to White before or during trial.\\n\\n      When asked whether this information would have affected his\\n\\ndecision to call Schullerman as a witness at trial, White’s trial\\n\\ncounsel stated, “[h]ad I been provided information of what he had\\n\\ngiven in that interview [with the State], that could have changed my\\n\\nopinion.” White’s trial counsel also testified that “[h]ad I known\\n\\n[what Schullerman said in the interview] during trial, I might have\\n\\n[called Schullerman as a witness] if for no other reason than to bring\\n\\nout the fact that he told the State something that they intentionally\\n\\nbrought evidence to the contrary? I don’t know if I would have done\\n\\nthat or not. I would have been much more tempted to do that. But\\n\\nI – I didn’t do it.”\\n\\n      To establish a Brady violation, White must show that:\\n\\n      (1) the State, including any part of the prosecution team,\\n      possessed evidence favorable to the defendant; (2) the\\n      defendant did not possess the favorable evidence and\\n      could not obtain it himself with any reasonable diligence;\\n      (3) the State suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) a\\n      reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the trial\\n      would have been different had the evidence been disclosed\\n\\n                                  69\\n      to the defense.\\n\\nAnthony v. State, 302 Ga. 546, 552 (807 SE2d 891) (2017) (citation\\n\\nomitted). “On appeal, we review a trial court’s factual findings\\n\\nregarding a Brady claim for clear error but review de novo the\\n\\ncourt’s application of the law to the facts.” Downer v. State, 314 Ga.\\n\\n617, 633 (878 SE2d 537) (2022). Pretermitting whether the first\\n\\nthree requirements are met here, White has failed to establish the\\n\\nfourth: that “a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the\\n\\ntrial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed.” Id.\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     White argues that the State’s failure to inform White of\\n\\nSchullerman’s statement constitutes a Brady violation because the\\n\\nstatement was “potentially exculpatory” and the State’s failure to\\n\\ndisclose it rendered White’s trial “fundamentally unfair.” But “‘[t]he\\n\\nmere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have\\n\\nhelped the defense’” does not satisfy the fourth Brady factor. Upton\\n\\nv. Parks, 284 Ga. 254, 256 (664 SE2d 196) (2008) (quoting United\\n\\nStates v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109-110 (96 SCt 2392, 49 LE2d 342)\\n\\n                                 70\\n (1976)). Rather, White must show “[a] ‘reasonable probability’ of a\\n\\ndifferent result[, which] is one in which the suppressed evidence\\n\\nundermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.” Turner v. United\\n\\nStates, 582 U.S. 313, 324 (137 SCt 1885, 198 LEd2d 443) (2017)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). Here, Schullerman’s alleged\\n\\nstatement would not have contradicted the evidence presented at\\n\\ntrial that Schullerman told Detective Payne, on the night Tyrael\\n\\ndied, that he and White fired a handgun at the shooting range. The\\n\\nalleged statement also would not undermine testimony from the\\n\\nshooting range’s owner that the shooting range had no record of\\n\\nSchullerman and White entering a firing lane on the night Tyrael\\n\\ndied.   And it would not have undermined evidence that a fatal\\n\\ncodeine dose was administered before White and Schullerman left\\n\\ntheir house to go to the shooting range. At most, Schullerman’s\\n\\nalleged statement repeated evidence the jury already heard from\\n\\nDetective Payne: that Schullerman said he and White fired a\\n\\nhandgun at the shooting range on the night Tyrael died. See Burney\\n\\nv. State, 309 Ga. 273, 284 (845 SE2d 625) (2020) (rejecting Brady\\n\\n                                71\\n claim on the prejudice prong where the defendant “offer[ed] no\\n\\nevidence that anything contained in the [alleged Brady material]\\n\\nmight have differed from the testimony about [that material] or\\n\\n[other evidence] that was presented at trial”); Mitchell, 307 Ga. at\\n\\n862-863 (explaining, on Brady’s prejudice prong, that the alleged\\n\\nBrady material would have been “unlikely to change the outcome of\\n\\n[the defendant’s] trial because the jury had already heard” the\\n\\nalleged Brady material); Lewis v. State, 304 Ga. 813, 817 (822 SE2d\\n\\n239) (2018) (rejecting the defendant’s Brady claim on the prejudice\\n\\nprong where “nothing in the [alleged Brady material] call[ed] into\\n\\nquestion the testimony” of other witnesses). Because White has\\n\\nfailed to establish a “reasonable probability” that Schullerman’s\\n\\nstatement would have “undermined confidence in the outcome of the\\n\\ntrial,” we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying White’s\\n\\nmotion for new trial on this basis. Turner, 582 U.S. at 324; see also\\n\\nState v. Thomas, 311 Ga. 407, 417 (858 SE2d 52) (2021) (“A\\n\\nreasonable probability of a different result is . . . shown when the\\n\\ngovernment’s evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the\\n\\n                                  72\\n outcome of the trial.”) (citation and punctuation omitted).17\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur, except McMillian\\nand LaGrua, JJ., who concur specially in Divisions 4 (a) and (b), and\\nColvin, J., who concurs in the judgment only in Division 4 (b) (ii).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      17 In our analysis of White’s claims, we have assumed one trial counsel\\n\\ndeficiency in failing to call a handwriting expert to testify at trial and one trial\\ncourt error in denying White’s motion to sever Count 15, and pretermitted\\nwhether the State committed a Brady violation by failing to disclose\\nSchullerman’s post-plea statement. White has not argued that we should\\napply a cumulative-error review. Even assuming that the assumed evidentiary\\nerror, the assumed deficiency of trial counsel, and the pretermitted Brady\\nviolation are the sorts of errors that could be assessed cumulatively, we\\nconclude that any such cumulative error did not likely affect the outcome of\\nthe trial. See Haufler v. State, 315 Ga. 712, 722 n.14 (884 SE2d 310) (2023)\\n(conducting a cumulative-error review even though the appellant did not invite\\nthe Court do so and stating that “even assuming that these presumed errors\\nshould be considered cumulatively, we conclude that [the appellant] has failed\\nto establish that the combined prejudicial effect of these errors requires a new\\ntrial”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n                                        73\\n      PETERSON, Presiding Justice, concurring.\\n\\n     I join the majority opinion in full. I write separately to respond\\n\\nbriefly to Justice McMillian’s special concurrence. I generally agree\\n\\nwith her assessment of Georgia’s RICO statute. But I agree with the\\n\\nmajority’s approach in not relying on that statutory law; over-\\n\\naggressive use of the RICO statute could pose potential\\n\\nconstitutional problems in a case like this one.\\n\\n     Georgia evidence law contains several provisions that, among\\n\\nother things, limit the admission of other crimes in criminal\\n\\nprosecutions. One reason for this is that when a jury is informed\\n\\nthat the criminal defendant in front of them did other bad things,\\n\\njurors (like all human beings) are naturally more inclined to think\\n\\nthe defendant did the separate bad thing at issue in the prosecution.\\n\\nWe often call this inference “propensity,” and label the State’s effort\\n\\nto   introduce    evidence     for        propensity   “improper”   and\\n\\n“impermissible.” See Morrell v. State, 313 Ga. 247, 258 (2) (a) (869\\n\\nSE2d 447) (2022). And the fact that propensity inferences are\\n\\nnatural only increases the risk that they undermine an accused’s\\n\\n                                     74\\n constitutional right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. See\\n\\nMichelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 475-476 (69 SCt 213, 93\\n\\nLE 168) (1948) (“[Evidence of the defendant’s bad character to\\n\\nestablish a probability of his guilt] is not rejected because character\\n\\nis irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much with the\\n\\njury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad\\n\\ngeneral record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a\\n\\nparticular charge.”); see also Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S.\\n\\n172, 182 (117 SCt 644, 136 LE2d 574) (1997) (“There is . . . no\\n\\nquestion that propensity would be an improper basis for\\n\\nconviction[.]” (punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     Georgia’s RICO statute is very broad; it allows the State to\\n\\nbring in evidence of all sorts of other crimes during a RICO\\n\\nprosecution. That’s of necessity; the statute was designed to combat\\n\\n“the increasing sophistication of various criminal elements,” OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-14-2 (a), and the kind of sophisticated conspiracies it was\\n\\ndesigned to reach are not susceptible to easy categorization. But the\\n\\nState seems increasingly to use that breadth in cases that do not\\n\\n                                  75\\n resemble paradigmatic RICO conspiracies; for example, this case\\n\\ninvolves “racketeering activity” between a girlfriend and boyfriend\\n\\nwho bear no resemblance whatsoever to sophisticated criminal\\n\\nenterprises. And the more aggressively the State uses RICO’s\\n\\nbreadth, the more concern arises about conflict between the RICO\\n\\nstatute and the accused’s constitutional right to a fair trial. The\\n\\nmajority’s approach wisely avoids having to grapple with such a\\n\\nchallenging and consequential question.\\n\\n     I am authorized to state that Justice Warren joins in this\\n\\nconcurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                76\\n MCMILLIAN, Justice, concurring specially in part.\\n\\n     In Division 4, the Court engages in an extensive analysis as to\\n\\nwhether the trial court should have severed what the Court defines\\n\\nas the “murder counts” from the “financial counts,” ultimately\\n\\nconcluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\\n\\nrefusing to sever because evidence of the “financial counts” was\\n\\nrelevant and probative to the State’s theory that those crimes served\\n\\nas a motive for the murder and that evidence of the “financial\\n\\ncounts” was not unduly prejudicial. In conducting this analysis, the\\n\\nCourt inexplicably does not recognize that the RICO count, which\\n\\nthe Court considers a “financial count,” incorporates by reference the\\n\\nmalice murder count as well as some of the other “murder counts”\\n\\nas overt acts committed in furtherance of the RICO conspiracy.\\n\\nBecause the crimes, as alleged, are intertwined, I conclude that the\\n\\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever and see\\n\\nno need to conduct the analysis engaged in by the Court.\\n\\n     Time and again, we have stated that where offenses are joined\\n\\nin a single indictment and the “joinder is based upon . . . a series of\\n\\n                                  77\\n acts connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or\\n\\nplan, severance lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge\\n\\nsince the facts in each case are likely to be unique.” Price v. State,\\n\\n316 Ga. 400, 404 (2) (888 SE2d 469) (2023) (emphasis supplied;\\n\\ncitation and punctuation omitted). See Rodriguez v. State, 309 Ga.\\n\\n542, 547 (2) (847 SE2d 303) (2020); Carson v. State, 308 Ga. 761,\\n\\n764-65 (2) (a) (843 SE2d 421) (2020); Simmons v. State, 282 Ga. 183,\\n\\n185 (4) (646 SE2d 55) (2007).\\n\\n     Here, White moved to sever Counts 1 (malice murder), 2 (felony\\n\\nmurder), 3 (aggravated battery), 4 (making a false statement that\\n\\nSchullerman had fired a handgun at the gun club on the evening of\\n\\nthe murder) and 6 (making a false statement by denying that White\\n\\nhad received a prescription of codeine) from the remaining counts.\\n\\nCount 16 alleged a RICO scheme which was summarized as follows\\n\\nin the indictment:\\n\\n     In order to support their lifestyle, their drug habit, and to\\n     obtain a life free of the care of a disabled child, Erica\\n     Claudette White (“White”), along with her boyfriend, co-\\n     defendant       Michael         Robert        Schullerman\\n     (“Schullerman”), conspired and endeavored in a scheme\\n\\n                                  78\\n      to obtain money and property through the overt acts\\n     below and by subsequently poisoning Tyrael McFall\\n     (“Tyrael”) to death through codeine toxicity.\\n\\nThe RICO count then alleged 37 overt acts committed in furtherance\\n\\nof the conspiracy, including malice murder as alleged in Count 1,\\n\\nmaking a false statement as alleged in Count 4, and making a false\\n\\nstatement as alleged in Count 6. The allegations from those counts\\n\\nwere explicitly incorporated by reference into the RICO count. Thus,\\n\\nit is clear that some of the counts that White sought to be severed,\\n\\nincluding the malice murder count, are alleged to be part of a larger\\n\\nRICO conspiracy.\\n\\n     In such a case, we assess whether “in view of the number of\\n\\noffenses charged and the complexity of the evidence to be offered,\\n\\nthe trier of fact will be able to distinguish the evidence and apply\\n\\nthe law intelligently as to each offense.” Price, 316 Ga. at 404 (2)\\n\\n(citation and punctation omitted). See Rodriguez, 309 Ga. at 547 (2);\\n\\nCarson, 308 Ga. at 765 (2) (a). The trier of fact was able to do that\\n\\nhere, and White has not pointed to any evidence showing that the\\n\\njury was misled or confused.\\n\\n                                 79\\n       Thus, I conclude that the trial court acted well within its sound\\n\\ndiscretion in refusing to sever and do not find it necessary to parse\\n\\nwhether the “financial counts” also supported White’s motive for the\\n\\nmurder.18 See Rodriguez, 309 Ga. at 542 n.1, 547-48 (2) (finding no\\n\\nabuse of discretion in trial court’s denial of motion to sever\\n\\ndefendant’s drug trafficking and gang activity counts from counts of\\n\\nmurder, because the drug charges were “inextricably bound” to the\\n\\nmurder charges, there was no evidence that the combined trial of\\n\\nthe charges “confused or misled the jury,” and the verdict itself,\\n\\nincluding acquittal on various counts, showed that the jury “fully\\n\\nunderstood the law and evidence” (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted)); Carson, 308 Ga. at 765-66 (2) (a) (finding no abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion in trial court’s refusal to sever charges stemming from\\n\\ncourse of continuing conduct where no evidence showed that the\\n\\n\\n\\n      18 The Court also expends considerable effort in distinguishing Harris v.\\n\\nState, 314 Ga. 238 (875 SE2d 659) (2022). In my view, Harris is distinguishable\\nbecause the State did not allege that Harris engaged in a scheme that included\\nmurdering his son and committing sexual acts with other women. See id. at\\n238-39, 258 (1) (m), 261 (3)-283 (4). The other acts that were introduced in that\\ntrial were only used to support motive, intent, and the absence of mistake or\\naccident. See id.\\n                                       80\\n combined trial of the charges confused or misled the jury and where\\n\\nverdict showed that the jury fully understood the law and evidence);\\n\\nOverton v. State, 295 Ga. App. 223, 223-24, 234-35 (3) (671 SE2d\\n\\n507) (2008) (finding no error in trial court’s denial of motion to sever\\n\\nRICO counts from crimes alleged to be a part of defendants’ scheme\\n\\nof illegal activity, and reasoning that the jury could distinguish the\\n\\nevidence and apply the law intelligently to each offense).19\\n\\n      For these reasons, I concur specially to Division 4 (a) and (b). I\\n\\nconcur fully in the remainder of the opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      19 In his concurring opinion, Presiding Justice Peterson explains that\\n\\n“the more aggressively the State uses RICO’s breadth, the more concern arises\\nabout conflict between the RICO statute and the accused’s constitutional right\\nto a fair trial” and that as a result, the “majority’s approach wisely avoids\\nhaving to grapple with such a challenging and consequential question.” Conc.\\nOp. at __. However, I note that in Division 5 (c), the Court rejects White’s\\nargument that the inclusion of the RICO count in the indictment “denied her\\na fair trial and due process as protected by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth\\nAmendment[s] to the United States Constitution, Art. I, Sec. I, Paragraphs I\\nand II of the Georgia Constitution, and OCGA § 24-4-404 as to the character of\\nthe accused.” Maj. Op. at 50-53 (cleaned up). And, White does not argue on\\nappeal that the RICO count should have been severed on the basis that\\nincluding the count would deprive her of her constitutional right to a fair trial.\\nFor these reasons, I do not see how the purported avoidance of such a\\n“challenging and consequential question” justifies the Court’s approach on\\nseverance.\\n                                       81\\n     I am authorized to state that Justice LaGrua joins in this\\n\\nconcurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             82\\n      LAGRUA, Justice, concurring specially in part.\\n\\n     I join Justice McMillian in concurring specially to Division 4\\n\\n(a) and (b), and I concur fully in the remainder of the majority\\n\\nopinion. I write separately to caution prosecutors regarding the\\n\\noveruse of RICO. The intent of Georgia’s RICO statute is to address\\n\\n“the increasing sophistication of various criminal elements and the\\n\\nincreasing extent to which the state and its citizens are harmed as\\n\\na result of the activities of these elements.” OCGA 16-14-2 (a). See\\n\\nalso Chancey v. State, 256 Ga. 415, 416 (I) (349 SE2d 717) (1986)\\n\\n(noting that Georgia’s RICO statute is patterned after the federal\\n\\nRICO statute, which dealt “with the problem of the infiltration of\\n\\norganized crime into all areas of American life through the money\\n\\nderived from its illegal endeavors.”). That is not this case. White did\\n\\nnot murder her two-year-old son as a part of a sophisticated criminal\\n\\nenterprise. And, just because we hold today that, under these facts,\\n\\nthe law supported trying White together for the RICO and the\\n\\nmurder charges does not mean that it was a smart use of the law. I\\n\\nremind the State that a prosecutor’s “duty is to seek justice, not\\n\\n                                  83\\n merely to convict. . . .” Carr v. State, 267 Ga. 701, 711 (10) (482 SE2d\\n\\n314) (1997) (citations and punctuation omitted). Continuing to\\n\\noveruse the law in this manner by charging RICO where it only\\n\\ntechnically applies could result in a rewrite of the law.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  84\\n '),\n",

OMSTEAD v. BPG INSPECTION, LLC et al.\\n\\n       MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n        In early 2020, Albert Omstead and BPG Inspection, LLC, a\\n\\nhome inspection company, entered into a contract setting out the\\n\\nterms for an inspection of a home and property that he and his wife,\\n\\nJessique Omstead, desired to purchase. One of the agreed-upon\\n\\nterms was a one-year limitation providing that Mr. Omstead could\\n\\nnot sue BPG Inspection or its employees after one year from the\\n\\ninspection. After the inspection was performed, the Omsteads\\n\\npurchased the home. More than a year later, Mr. Omstead died after\\n\\na retaining wall at his home collapsed on him. Mrs. Omstead then\\n\\nfiled a wrongful death suit against BPG Inspection and one of its\\n\\ninspectors, James Golden (collectively, “BPG”).1 The trial court\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 From here on, we refer to Jessique Omstead as “Omstead” or “Mrs.\\n\\nOmstead,” and to her deceased husband Albert Omstead as “Mr. Omstead.”\\n determined on the cross-motions for summary judgment that for\\n\\nvarious reasons, the one-year limitation was unenforceable, but the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals reversed. We granted review to consider whether\\n\\nthe Court of Appeals erred in approving the one-year limitation and\\n\\nwhether the limitation is void as against public policy. We conclude\\n\\nthat the one-year limitation is enforceable and that the provision is\\n\\nnot void as against public policy. Accordingly, we affirm. 2\\n\\n      1. We review the legal issues raised in a grant or denial of a\\n\\nmotion for summary judgment de novo. See City of Winder v. Barrow\\n\\nCounty, ___ Ga. ___ (1) (899 SE2d 157) (2024) (2024 WL 923102,\\n\\n2024 Ga. LEXIS 67); Toyo Tire North America Mfg., Inc. v. Davis,\\n\\n299 Ga. 155, 161 (2) (787 SE2d 171) (2016). However, when factual\\n\\nissues are presented on cross-motions for summary judgment, as\\n\\nthey are here, “we view the evidence in the light most favorable to\\n\\nthe nonmovants.” Raffensperger v. Jackson, 316 Ga. 383, 387 (2)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 This case was orally argued on March 21, 2024. We thank Georgians\\n\\nfor Lawsuit Reform and the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association for their helpful\\namicus curiae briefs.\\n                                      2\\n (888 SE2d 483) (2023).\\n\\n     So viewed, in early 2020, Albert Omstead engaged BPG\\n\\nInspection to inspect a property the Omsteads wanted to purchase.\\n\\nGolden, a BPG employee, inspected the property on February 13,\\n\\n2020. On the same day and before the inspection, Mr. Omstead\\n\\nsigned an agreement (“Inspection Agreement” or “Agreement”)\\n\\nprovided by BPG, which contained several limitations on liability,\\n\\nincluding a provision limiting BPG’s liability to one year from the\\n\\ninspection. In pertinent part, this one-year limitation stated in\\n\\nbolded font:\\n\\n         YOU MAY NOT FILE A LEGAL ACTION,\\n     WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT (EVEN IF DUE TO\\n     OUR NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT), CONTRACT,\\n     ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST US OR\\n     OUR EMPLOYEES MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER\\n     THE INSPECTION, EVEN IF YOU DO NOT DISCOVER\\n     A DEFECT UNTIL AFTER THAT.\\n\\n     In exchange for a $380 inspection fee, Golden performed an\\n\\ninspection and prepared an inspection report (“Report”). The Report\\n\\nprovided numerous comments on items needing repair or posing\\n\\nhealth and safety concerns, but stated that “[l]atent, inaccessible, or\\n\\n                                  3\\n concealed defects are excluded from this inspection.” Instead, the\\n\\nReport described the inspection’s scope as “a non-invasive\\n\\nexamination of readily accessible systems and components as\\n\\noutlined in the Standards of Practice of the American Society of\\n\\nHome Inspectors” or in the client’s “specific state standards.” As part\\n\\nof the inspection, Golden looked at a retaining wall running the\\n\\nlength of the property’s driveway. The Report noted that the wall\\n\\nhad been “[i]nspected,” which the Report defined as “visually\\n\\nobserved and appears to be functioning as intended.” The Report did\\n\\nnot identify defects in the retaining wall or recommend that the wall\\n\\nbe repaired.\\n\\n     On March 7, 2020, Golden, at the request of Omstead’s real\\n\\nestate agent, returned to the property to reinspect several items that\\n\\nthe Omsteads had requested that the seller repair pursuant to\\n\\nBPG’s recommendations. After that inspection, a second inspection\\n\\nreport and summary of key findings were generated, but neither\\n\\ndocument identified defects in the retaining wall or recommended\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  4\\n that the wall be repaired.3\\n\\n      Following the inspections, the Omsteads purchased the\\n\\nproperty. On July 16, 2020, Omstead posted on Instagram photos of\\n\\nthe retaining wall and garage, with a caption including the\\n\\nobservation that “[t]here are cracks in the retaining wall that spit\\n\\nwater when it rains, but no official drain holes.”\\n\\n      Over a year later, during a rainstorm on July 19, 2021, Mr.\\n\\nOmstead began placing a plastic tarp and a piece of particle board\\n\\non top of the retaining wall to divert water away from the garage.\\n\\nAs he was doing so, the wall collapsed on him, and he died as a\\n\\nresult.\\n\\n      In September 2021, Omstead filed suit against BPG and\\n\\nGolden for wrongful death, alleging negligence, fraud, breach of\\n\\n\\n      3  Omstead claims that this second inspection is not covered by the\\nInspection Agreement, pointing to language in the Agreement stating that\\n“[t]his fee is based on a single visit to the property,” to testimony that a\\nreinspection is “another inspection,” and to the lack of a second agreement.\\nHowever, Omstead does not dispute that the second inspection was a follow-\\nup to the first inspection to ensure that the recommended repairs were made.\\nThus, the second inspection flows directly from the Inspection Agreement, and\\nthe evidence on which Omstead relies does not create a genuine issue of\\nmaterial fact as to whether the second inspection was covered by the Inspection\\nAgreement.\\n                                      5\\n contract, and breach of express and implied warranties, among other\\n\\nclaims. She later added a count for gross negligence.4 BPG moved\\n\\nfor summary judgment, seeking to enforce the Inspection\\n\\nAgreement’s limitations on liability, including its one-year\\n\\nlimitation. Omstead filed a cross-motion for summary judgment,\\n\\nasking, among other things, that the trial court hold that the one-\\n\\nyear limitation provision was void as against public policy and, in\\n\\nthe alternative, that the limitation did not apply to Omstead’s\\n\\nclaims because it is an exculpatory clause that must be read strictly\\n\\nagainst the drafter and the clause only refers to claims for property\\n\\ndamage.\\n\\n      The trial court denied BPG’s motion for summary judgment\\n\\nand    granted    Omstead’s     cross-motion,     concluding     that   the\\n\\nAgreement’s limitations on liability did not apply to Omstead’s\\n\\npersonal injury and wrongful death claims, and that to the extent\\n\\nthey did, they were void as against public policy.\\n\\n      The Court of Appeals reversed and directed the trial court to\\n\\n\\n      4 Omstead also added claims as representative of Mr. Omstead’s estate.\\n\\n                                     6\\n enter summary judgment in favor of BPG. As an initial matter, the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals held that though the Inspection Agreement was\\n\\nbetween BPG and Mr. Omstead, BPG could assert the Agreement’s\\n\\none-year limitation as a defense against Omstead’s claims as well.\\n\\nSee BPG Inspection, LLC v. Omstead, 367 Ga. App. 128, 131-32 (1)\\n\\n(883 SE2d 593) (2023) (“‘any defense which would have been good\\n\\nagainst the decedent is good against his representatives in a\\n\\nwrongful death action’” (emphasis omitted; quoting United Health\\n\\nSvcs. of Ga. v. Norton, 300 Ga. 736, 738 (2) (797 SE2d 825) (2017)).\\n\\nNext, the Court of Appeals concluded, as a matter of contractual\\n\\ninterpretation, that the Agreement’s one-year limitation applied to\\n\\nall of Omstead’s claims, including her tort claims, because the\\n\\nlimitation expressly applied to any “legal action, whether sounding\\n\\nin tort (even if due to [BPG’s] negligence or other fault), contract,\\n\\narbitration or otherwise[.]” See 367 Ga. App. at 132 (1) (quoting\\n\\nInspection Agreement). Finally, the Court of Appeals held that the\\n\\none-year limitation was enforceable and not void as against public\\n\\npolicy. See id. at 132-36 (1).\\n\\n                                 7\\n      We granted review on two questions: (1) Did the Court of\\n\\nAppeals err in approving a provision in a contract between a home\\n\\ninspection company and a consumer that limits the home inspection\\n\\ncompany’s liability for claims arising out of any breach of its legal or\\n\\ncontractual duties to within one year after the inspection? (2) Is such\\n\\na provision void as against public policy?\\n\\n     2. We first consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in\\n\\nenforcing the one-year limitation against Omstead. First, Omstead\\n\\nargues that the one-year limitation applies only to contract claims\\n\\nand not claims involving bodily injury or wrongful death or to claims\\n\\nfor gross negligence and fraud. Next, she asserts that the Court of\\n\\nAppeals erred in treating the one-year limitation as a “statute of\\n\\nlimitation”   even   though     the    limitation   functioned   as   a\\n\\n“contractually-effectuated statute of repose,” which Omstead claims\\n\\nGeorgia law prohibits. Third, she argues that the one-year limitation\\n\\nimpermissibly voids “professional standards of conduct.” We address\\n\\neach argument in turn.\\n\\n     (a) “The cardinal rule of [contract] construction is to ascertain\\n\\n                                   8\\n the intention of the parties. Where the language in a contract is\\n\\nunambiguous, that task is often a straightforward one.” Sutherlin v.\\n\\nSutherlin, 301 Ga. 581, 584-85 (II) (A) (802 SE2d 204) (2017)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). Turning to the language of the\\n\\ncontract, we observe that the one-year limitation provides: “You may\\n\\nnot file a legal action, whether sounding in tort (even if due to\\n\\n[BPG’s] negligence or other fault), contract, arbitration or\\n\\notherwise[.]” By its plain language, the one-year limitation\\n\\nexpressly applies to tort and contract claims. Thus, as a threshold\\n\\nmatter, we agree with the Court of Appeals’s interpretation of the\\n\\none-year limitation as applying to Omstead’s wrongful death claims,\\n\\nwhich sound in tort and contract. See First Acceptance Ins. Co. of\\n\\nGeorgia, Inc. v. Hughes, 305 Ga. 489, 494 (2) (826 SE2d 71) (2019)\\n\\n(“Contractual language that is plain, unambiguous, and capable of\\n\\nonly one reasonable interpretation must be afforded its literal\\n\\nmeaning” (citation and punctuation omitted)). Compare Langley v.\\n\\nMP Spring Lake, LLC, 307 Ga. 321, 327 (834 SE2d 800) (2019)\\n\\n(construing a lease agreement’s limitation on liability as applying\\n\\n                                 9\\n “only to claims arising from the contract, and not to Langley’s free-\\n\\nstanding tort claims,” where that limitation used the words “any\\n\\nlegal action” but did not expressly state that it applied to tort\\n\\nclaims).5\\n\\n      Relying on McFann v. Sky Warriors, Inc., 268 Ga. App. 750\\n\\n(603 SE2d 7) (2004), Omstead argues that even if the one-year\\n\\nlimitation applies to tort claims in general, the Court of Appeals\\n\\nerred in enforcing the one-year limitation to bar her claims for gross\\n\\nnegligence and fraud because such a limitation is an exculpatory\\n\\nclause and such clauses have been held to not apply to claims of\\n\\ngross negligence and fraud. See id. at 758 (4) (“Although exculpatory\\n\\nclauses are valid and binding and not void as against public policy,\\n\\nexculpatory clauses do not relieve a party from liability for acts of\\n\\n\\n\\n      5 Omstead argues that the one-year limitation does not apply to her\\nwrongful death claims because the Inspection Agreement focuses on the\\ndiscovery and repair of property “defects” rather than on death or bodily injury.\\nBut again, Omstead’s wrongful death claims sound in tort and contract, and\\nthe one-year limitation plainly states that she may not file “a legal action,\\nwhether sounding in tort (even if due to [BPG’s] negligence or other fault) [or]\\ncontract [.]” (emphasis supplied). Thus, we read the limitation as applicable to\\nOmstead’s wrongful death claims. See First Acceptance Ins. Co., 305 Ga. at 494\\n(2).\\n                                       10\\n gross negligence or wilful or wanton conduct.” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     An “exculpatory clause” is “[a] contractual provision relieving\\n\\na party from liability resulting from a negligent or wrongful act.”\\n\\nEXCULPATORY CLAUSE, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).\\n\\nBut here, even if the limitation operates to bar suit against BPG\\n\\ngiven the timing of Mr. Omstead’s death, the limitation did not\\n\\npurport to relieve or release BPG from liability, because the\\n\\nlimitation permitted suit against BPG—that is, subjected BPG to\\n\\npotential liability—within a year from the inspection. 6 Compare\\n\\nEmory University v. Porubiansky, 248 Ga. 391, 392 (282 SE2d 903)\\n\\n(1981) (language in dental form providing that the patient agreed to\\n\\n“‘expressly waive and relinquish any and all claims of every nature\\n\\nI or my minor child or ward may have’” and further “‘to hold them\\n\\nharmless as the result of any claims by such minor child or ward,\\n\\narising out of any dental treatment rendered, regardless of its\\n\\n\\n     6  We express no opinion on whether a contractual limitation period\\nshorter than one year from the date an action accrues or from another date,\\namounts to or could amount to an exculpatory clause.\\n                                    11\\n nature or extent’” was an exculpatory clause); McFann, 268 Ga. App.\\n\\nat 751, 753-54 (2) (exculpatory clause provided that “‘Participant\\n\\nhereby releases, waives, and forever discharges Sky Warriors, Inc.’”\\n\\nfrom liability, without permitting any period to file suit); Colonial\\n\\nProperties Realty Ltd.

Co., 256 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 106, 107, 112 (5) (567 SE2d 389) (2002) (exculpatory provisions\\n\\nprovided that a party “waive[d] all rights” for various fire damages,\\n\\nwithout specifying a timeframe where the rights were still\\n\\npreserved). Accordingly, we conclude that the principle enunciated\\n\\nin McFann—that “exculpatory clauses” do not protect against\\n\\nliability for gross negligence or wilful or wanton conduct, see 268 Ga.\\n\\nat 758 (4)—does not apply to the one-year limitation in this case.\\n\\n     (b) Omstead also contends that the limitation provision should\\n\\nnot be enforced because it acts as a “contractual repose” provision,\\n\\nrunning from the date of the inspection rather than the date that\\n\\nher action accrued. As relevant here, Omstead asserts a claim for\\n\\nwrongful death, which “does not accrue until the death occurs[.]”\\n\\nWilliams v. Georgia Dept. of Human Resources, 272 Ga. 624, 626\\n\\n                                  12\\n (532 SE2d 401) (2000). See OCGA § 9-3-33 (“[A]ctions for injuries to\\n\\nthe person shall be brought within two years after the right of action\\n\\naccrues[.]”). Omstead thus argues that the one-year limitation\\n\\nexpired before the wrongful death claim accrued, depriving Omstead\\n\\nof the opportunity to assert a claim, and that no such type of\\n\\n“contractual repose” provision has been enforced in Georgia.\\n\\n     We start with first principles. “[A] party may contract away\\n\\nliability to the other party for the consequences of his own negligence\\n\\nwithout contravening public policy, except when such agreement is\\n\\nprohibited by statute.” Milliken & Co. v. Georgia Power Co., 306 Ga.\\n\\n6, 8 (1) (829 SE2d 111) (2019) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\nSee New v. Southern R. Co., 116 Ga. 147, 147-51 (42 SE 391) (1902)\\n\\n(holding that contractual clause exempting railway company from\\n\\nliability for injuries sustained by employees during employment,\\n\\ncould bar non-criminal negligence claims against company).\\n\\n     Omstead offers no case where we have rejected a contractual\\n\\nprovision like the one-year limitation in this case on the grounds\\n\\nthat the limitation period expired before a party’s claims accrued or\\n\\n                                  13\\n on the grounds that the limitation period deprived a party of the\\n\\nopportunity to bring a claim. And given our longstanding caution in\\n\\ninterfering with the freedom of parties to contract, our silence on\\n\\n“contractual repose” periods is not enough for us to declare them\\n\\nvoid or unenforceable. See generally Innovative Images, LLC v.\\n\\nSummerville, 309 Ga. 675, 681 (3) (a) (848 SE2d 75) (2020) (“this\\n\\nCourt long emphasized that courts must exercise extreme caution in\\n\\ndeclaring a contract void as against public policy and may do so only\\n\\nwhere the case is free from doubt and an injury to the public clearly\\n\\nappears” (citation and punctuation omitted)); Nat’l Cas.

Singer, 250 Ga. 470, 471-72 (298 SE2d\\n\\n484) (1983), and in Shessel v. Stroup, 253 Ga. 56, 56, 58 (316 SE2d\\n\\n155) (1984). But Clark and Shessel are inapposite. In both cases we\\n\\nheld that a statute of repose was unconstitutional as applied,\\n\\nbecause the statute violated equal protection clauses under the\\n\\nfederal and state constitutions. See Clark, 250 Ga. at 472 (“We find\\n\\nno rational basis for a limitation scheme which permits a medical\\n\\nmalpractice wrongful death action if the patient dies within two\\n\\nyears of the defendant's negligent act but which bars a wrongful\\n\\n                                  16\\n death action if the patient lives for two years after defendant's\\n\\nnegligent act where the defendant is a doctor but not in other\\n\\nwrongful death cases.”); Stressel, 253 Ga. at 58 (similar statutory\\n\\nscheme involving a period of repose failed to show “substantial\\n\\nrelation” to the object of the legislation). Here, by contrast, Omstead\\n\\nmakes no argument challenging any statutory scheme on equal\\n\\nprotection grounds.\\n\\n     (c) In addition, Omstead argues that the one-year limitation\\n\\nshould   not   be   enforced   because   it   “contractually   avoid[s]\\n\\nprofessional standards of conduct” in violation of Porubiansky.\\n\\nThere, we held that “it is against the public policy of this state to\\n\\nallow one who procures a license to practice dentistry to relieve\\n\\nhimself by contract of the duty to exercise reasonable care.”\\n\\nPorubiansky, 248 Ga. at 394. Omstead argues that home inspectors\\n\\nowe duties under OCGA §§ 8-3-331 and 8-3-332, including duties to\\n\\nprovide a written report and make recommendations for repairs.7\\n\\n\\n     7 Omstead also suggests that BPG owed Mr. Omstead duties that one\\n\\nowes those for whom one voluntarily undertakes to perform services. See\\n\\n                                  17\\n       But Porubiansky is distinguishable. There, we did not enforce\\n\\nthe liability release at issue because “the attempt to relieve the clinic\\n\\n. . . from the statutory duty of care for licensed professional medical\\n\\nservices conflicts with and frustrates the policies of the state as\\n\\nexpressed through our General Assembly.” 248 Ga. at 392-93.\\n\\nDentistry, we explained, is a profession “licensed and controlled by\\n\\nthe state.” See id. at 393-94 (citing Ga. Code Ann. of 1933, Chapter\\n\\n§ 84-7). The “legislature has established a minimum standard of\\n\\ncare” that “governs the duties and responsibilities of a dentist.” Id.\\n\\nat 394 (citing Ga. Code Ann. of 1933, § 84-924 (now OCGA § 51-1-\\n\\n27) (“A person professing to practice surgery or the administering of\\n\\nmedicine for compensation must bring to the exercise of his\\n\\nprofession a reasonable degree of care and skill.”)).\\n\\n      The statutory backdrop in Porubiansky—which reflected “the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRymer v. Polo Golf & Country Club Homeowners Assn., Inc., 335 Ga. App. 167,\\n175-76 (2) (b) (780 SE2d 95) (2015) (referencing Restatement (Second) of Torts\\n§ 323 to discuss a duty of one who voluntarily undertakes to perform a service\\nfor another who relies on it, to perform that service with reasonable care). But\\nBPG was compensated for performing the inspection, so the voluntary\\nundertaking doctrine does not apply.\\n                                      18\\n strong policy of the state . . . to regulate those professionals that it\\n\\nlicenses,” 248 Ga. at 393-94—is not present here. While dentists are\\n\\nlicensed professionals under the Georgia Code, see OCGA § 43-11-1,\\n\\net seq. (Title 43 (“Professions and Businesses”), Chapter 11\\n\\n(“Dentists, Dental Hygienists, and Dental Assistants”)); Ga. Code\\n\\nAnn. of 1933, Chapter § 84-7, no similar statutory scheme or policy\\n\\nto license home inspectors exists. And, the statutory scheme\\n\\ngoverning home inspections focuses on the content of the inspections\\n\\nand resulting reports, rather than on the duty of home inspectors as\\n\\nprofessionals. Omstead points to OCGA § 8-3-331, 8 but nothing in\\n\\nthe statute’s plain text imposes upon home inspectors a duty to\\n\\nconduct an inspection with a particular standard of care, as do the\\n\\n\\n     8 OCGA § 8-3-331 states:\\n\\n           Every home inspector shall provide to the person on whose\\n     behalf a home or single-family dwelling is being inspected a\\n     written document specifying:\\n           (1) The scope of the inspection, including those structural\\n           elements, systems, and subsystems to be inspected;\\n           (2) That the inspection is a visual inspection; and\\n           (3) That the home inspector will notify in writing the person\\n           on whose behalf such inspection is being made of any defects\\n           noted during the inspection, along with any recommendation\\n           that certain experts be retained to determine the extent and\\n           corrective action necessary for such defects.\\n                                     19\\n statutes governing dentists and other medical professionals. See\\n\\nPorubiansky, 248 Ga. at 393-94. Instead, the statute merely requires\\n\\na home inspector to provide a “written document” specifying certain\\n\\naspects of the inspection: (1) the inspection’s “scope,” (2) “[t]hat the\\n\\ninspection is a visual inspection,” and (3) “[t]hat the home inspector\\n\\nwill notify in writing” the consumer “of any defects noted during the\\n\\ninspection, along with any recommendation that certain experts be\\n\\nretained to determine the extent and corrective action necessary for\\n\\nsuch defects.”9 OCGA § 8-3-331.\\n\\n     Unless the contractual provision is otherwise in contravention\\n\\nof public policy, which we consider below, Omstead has offered no\\n\\nreason not to enforce the one-year limitation here—a period the\\n\\nparties have mutually agreed to by contract—even though the one-\\n\\nyear period expired before Omstead’s wrongful death claim accrued.\\n\\nThus, we answer the first question posed on certiorari in the\\n\\nnegative: the Court of Appeals did not err in approving a provision\\n\\n\\n\\n     9OCGA § 8-3-332, in turn, provides that those who violate OCGA § 8-3-\\n\\n331 “shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.”\\n                                     20\\n in a contract between a home inspection company and a consumer\\n\\nthat limits the home inspection company’s liability for claims arising\\n\\nout of any breach of its legal or contractual duties to within one year\\n\\nafter the inspection. 10\\n\\n      3. Turning to the second question, we consider whether the\\n\\none-year limitation is void as against public policy. “A contract that\\n\\nis against the policy of the law cannot be enforced.” OCGA § 13-8-2\\n\\n(a). And as this Court has stated:\\n\\n            A contract cannot be said to be contrary to public\\n      policy unless the General Assembly has declared it to be\\n      so, or unless the consideration of the contract is contrary\\n      to good morals and contrary to law, or unless the contract\\n\\n      10 At oral argument, some members of the Court raised the concern that\\n\\nthe one-year limitation may be voidable as unconscionable. We have defined\\nan unconscionable contract as one that “no sane man not acting under a\\ndelusion would make and that no honest man would take advantage of[.]” NEC\\nTechnologies., Inc. v. Nelson, 267 Ga. 390, 391 (1) n.2 (478 SE2d 769) (1996)\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). Though an unconscionability inquiry may\\noverlap with an inquiry on whether a contract violates public policy, the two\\ninquiries are different. Compare Innovative Images, 309 Ga. at 684-85 (3) (b)\\n(“We examine unconscionability from the perspective of substantive\\nunconscionability, which looks to the contractual terms themselves, and\\nprocedural unconscionability, which considers the process of making the\\ncontract.” (emphasis, citation, and punctuation omitted)), with Dept. of Transp.\\nv.

(emphasis in original).\\n\\n     Omstead argues that the one-year limitation is void because it\\n\\n                                  22\\n violates OCGA § 13-8-2 (b), which states, in pertinent part:\\n\\n           A covenant, promise, agreement, or understanding\\n     [1] in or in connection with or collateral to a contract or\\n     agreement relative to the construction, alteration, repair, or\\n     maintenance of a building structure, appurtenances, and\\n     appliances, including moving, demolition, and excavating\\n     connected therewith, [2] purporting to require that one\\n     party to such contract or agreement shall indemnify, hold\\n     harmless, insure, or defend the other party to the contract\\n     or other named indemnitee, including its . . . employees,\\n     against liability or claims for damages, losses, or expenses,\\n     including attorney fees, arising out of bodily injury to\\n     persons, death, or damage to property caused by or\\n     resulting from the sole negligence of the indemnitee, or its\\n     . . . employees, is against public policy and void and\\n     unenforceable.\\n\\n(Emphasis supplied).\\n\\n     Omstead contends that the Inspection Agreement is a “contract\\n\\nor agreement relative to the construction, alteration, repair, or\\n\\nmaintenance” of property, see OCGA § 13-8-2 (b), because the\\n\\nAgreement mentions “repairing [a] defect,” an inspection was\\n\\nperformed to identify defects in need of repair, and an inspection\\n\\nreport was generated that contained many comments concerning\\n\\n“defects” and “repairs.” See Milliken, 306 Ga. at 10 (1) (a) (“Georgia\\n\\ncourts have consistently construed OCGA § 13-8-2 (b) broadly”\\n\\n                                  23\\n (citation and punctuation omitted)); Kennedy Dev.

We\\nneed not parse whether there is any material difference between these types\\nof provisions because we conclude that the one-year limitation is neither.\\n                                    24\\n acting at his request or for his benefit.” Lanier at McEver, L.P. v.\\n\\nPlanners & Engineers Collaborative, Inc., 284 Ga. 204, 206-07 (2)\\n\\n(663 SE2d 240) (2008) (citation and punctuation omitted). See\\n\\nINDEMNIFY, Black’s Law Dictionary, 11th ed. (“Indemnify” means\\n\\n“[t]o reimburse (another) for a loss suffered because of a third party’s\\n\\nor one’s own act or default,” to “promise to reimburse (another) for\\n\\nsuch a loss,” or to “give (another) security against such a loss.”). To\\n\\n“hold harmless” means to “absolve (another party) from any\\n\\nresponsibility for damage or other liability arising from the\\n\\ntransaction.” HOLD HARMLESS, Black’s Law Dictionary, 11th ed.\\n\\nSee Lanier, 284 Ga. at 209-10 (1) (Melton, J., dissenting) (citing\\n\\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 731 (6th ed. 1990) to state that “[a] hold\\n\\nharmless clause is an ‘[a]greement or contract in which one party\\n\\nagrees to hold the other without responsibility for damage or other\\n\\nliability arising out of the transaction involved.’”).\\n\\n     Here, the plain text of the one-year limitation does not require\\n\\nOmstead to reimburse or “make good” any damage to BPG, nor does\\n\\nit require that Omstead hold BPG harmless for any loss. See Lanier,\\n\\n                                   25\\n 284 Ga. at 206 (2) (citation and punctuation omitted). Compare\\n\\nMilliken, 306 Ga. at 7 (provision stated that one party “shall hold\\n\\n[Milliken] . . . harmless from any damages to property or persons”\\n\\nresulting from that party’s conduct (punctuation omitted)); Kennedy,\\n\\n290 Ga. at 258 (indemnification and hold-harmless provision stated\\n\\nthat an entity “shall . . . indemnify, defend and hold [Appellant]\\n\\nharmless”).\\n\\n     Yet, Omstead argues that the one-year limitation still\\n\\nfunctions as an indemnity or hold-harmless provision, just as a\\n\\ncontractual clause did in Lanier, 248 Ga. at 206-07 (2). In Lanier, a\\n\\nlarge construction developer retained a civil engineering firm to\\n\\ndesign a storm-water drainage system and, in the contract for\\n\\nservices, agreed to a clause limiting the liability of the engineering\\n\\nfirm for any claims, including those of third parties, to the\\n\\nengineering firm’s fee for the services. See Lanier, 284 Ga. at 204-\\n\\n05. We recognized in Lanier that though the clause did not explicitly\\n\\nrequire the developer to “indemnify” or “hold harmless” the\\n\\nengineering firm, the clause nonetheless acted as an indemnity and\\n\\n                                 26\\n hold-harmless provision because it applied to “any and all claims by\\n\\nthird parties and shift[ed] all liability above the fee for services to\\n\\nLanier no matter the origin of the claim or who is at fault.” Id. at\\n\\n207-08 (2) (punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here by contrast, the one-year limitation does not authorize\\n\\nBPG to recover from Omstead damages that BPG has incurred\\n\\nbecause of a third-party claim arising from BGP’s sole negligence.\\n\\nThe one-year limitation does not “shift liability” from BPG to\\n\\nOmstead: Omstead is not being made to pay for the damages that\\n\\nBPG owes a third party. Nor does the limitation “absolve” BPG from\\n\\nliability. See HOLD HARMLESS, Black’s Law Dictionary, 11th ed.\\n\\nInstead, the limitation only requires Omstead to “not file a legal\\n\\naction” after one year from the inspection, permitting suit to be filed\\n\\nagainst BPG within the one-year period—and thus the possibility\\n\\nthat BPG incur “responsibility” for damage arising from the\\n\\ninspection. See Lanier, 284 Ga. at 209-10 (1).\\n\\n     For these reasons, we conclude that the one-year limitation\\n\\ndoes not violate OCGA § 13-8-2 (b) and is not void as against public\\n\\n                                  27\\n policy. 12\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur, except Pinson, J.,\\ndisqualified.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      12  Omstead also contends, in passing, that the one-year limitation\\nviolates OCGA § 13-8-2 (c), which applies to contracts or agreements “in . . .\\nengineering, architectural, or land surveying services” and requiring one party\\nto “indemnify, hold harmless, insure, or defend” another. Even if we assume\\nthat the Inspection Agreement is the type of agreement covered by OCGA § 13-\\n8-2 (c), we conclude, for the same reasons as above, that the one-year limitation\\nis not an indemnity or a hold-harmless provision and thus does not violate\\nOCGA § 13-8-2 (c).\\n                                       28\\n       PETERSON, Presiding Justice, concurring dubitante.\\n\\n      I concur in the decision of the Court because it is a faithful\\n\\napplication of our precedent. But I do so dubitante because I cannot\\n\\nkick the nagging sense that there’s something missing from the law.\\n\\nFootnote 6 appropriately notes that we do not address whether a\\n\\nshorter limitations period would have been enforceable. During\\n\\nargument, the question was put to counsel for BPG as to whether a\\n\\nlimitation period shorter than a year could ever be enforceable.\\n\\nCounsel stated that a period of one day would be unconscionable.13\\n\\nIn follow-up questions, counsel acknowledged that a 30-day period\\n\\nwould be unconscionable, and could not identify where the line was\\n\\nthat rendered a limitations period too short to be enforceable.\\n\\n      But neither can I. And there may not be just one line; it seems\\n\\nreasonable to think that the subject matter of the contract is\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      13 As the Court’s opinion notes, we do not consider unconscionability here\\n\\nbecause the plaintiff did not raise it below. But it’s not clear to me that a too-\\nshort limitations period must always be assessed under only unconscionability,\\nrather than assessed through a public policy lens as an exculpatory clause. The\\neffect of a too-short limitations period seems to me as not materially different\\nfrom an exculpatory clause.\\n                                       29\\n relevant to how long a period must be (during questioning, counsel\\n\\nacknowledged that subject matter “may be” relevant). For example,\\n\\na sufficient limitations period for a contract for replacement of brake\\n\\npads could likely be shorter than the limitations period would need\\n\\nto be for a contract for construction of underground infrastructure,\\n\\nwhere one would expect a defect to take longer to become noticeable.\\n\\nAnd if that’s so, a contract for building inspection (like the one at\\n\\nissue here) would seem to be closer to the latter.\\n\\n     But these sorts of distinctions are difficult for a court to draw\\n\\nin any principled manner, and I don’t see a clear legal basis under\\n\\nour precedent for doing so in a way that sets the line at more than\\n\\none year in this case. And as the Court’s decision makes clear, our\\n\\nprecedent is best read to leave those distinctions for the legislature\\n\\nto draw. For that matter, that’s a point Presiding Judge Barnes\\n\\nmade below in her full and special concurrence, which I agree with\\n\\nto that extent. See BPG Inspection, LLC v. Omstead, 367 Ga. App.\\n\\n128, 136 (883 SE2d 593) (2023) (Barnes, P.J., concurring fully and\\n\\nspecially).\\n\\n                                  30\\n      In short, I don’t have a sufficient legal basis to dissent from the\\n\\nCourt’s conclusion that nothing in our law allows us to say that the\\n\\none-year contractual limitations period here was void for public\\n\\npolicy, and so I join the opinion of the Court fully. I just do so with\\n\\nsome unresolved questions, and thus I concur dubitante.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  31\\n \"),\n",

TATUM v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        COLVIN, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Mark Joseph Tatum was convicted of a “peeping\\n\\nTom” violation and invasion of privacy in relation to his\\n\\nsurreptitious recording of a female neighbor through her window.1\\n\\n\\n       1 The incident occurred late at night on July 15, 2018, and Appellant was\\n\\narrested either on July 15, 2018, or very early in the morning on July 16, 2018.\\nOn October 17, 2018, Appellant was indicted by a Madison County grand jury\\nfor a “peeping Tom” violation pursuant to OCGA § 16-11-61 (Count 1), invasion\\nof privacy in violation of OCGA § 16-11-62 (Count 2), and tampering with\\nevidence in violation of OCGA § 16-10-94 (Count 3). On January 18, 2019,\\nAppellant filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his cell phone.\\nThe trial court conducted a hearing on Appellant’s motion on October 9, 2019,\\nand denied it by summary order on October 17, 2019. Following Appellant’s\\nwaiver of his right to a jury trial, the trial court held a bench trial on October\\n21, 2021. The trial court found Appellant guilty of a “peeping Tom” violation\\nand invasion of privacy but found him not guilty of tampering with evidence.\\nThe court sentenced Appellant to five years in prison, with two years and six\\nmonths to serve for Count 1, and five years of probation for Count 2, to be\\nserved consecutively to Count 1, along with various fines and fees. On October\\n21, 2021, the same day of his sentencing, Appellant appealed his conviction to\\nthe Court of Appeals. On April 17, 2023, the Court of Appeals issued a decision\\naffirming Appellant’s conviction. See generally Tatum v. State, 367 Ga. App.\\n Appellant was stopped within several minutes of the neighbor’s call\\n\\nto 911, and his cell phone was lawfully seized. 2 Appellant was not\\n\\nplaced under arrest, however, until after the arresting officer viewed\\n\\nthe contents of Appellant’s cell phone without a warrant.\\n\\nInformation from this warrantless search was then used in an\\n\\naffidavit to obtain a warrant for the search of Appellant’s cell phone,\\n\\nthe contents of which the arresting officer had already seen, at least\\n\\nin part. Appellant moved to suppress evidence obtained from the\\n\\nwarrantless and warrant-authorized searches of his cell phone\\n\\nunder the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\\n\\nArticle I, Section I, Paragraph XIII of the Georgia Constitution, 3 but\\n\\n\\n\\n439 (886 SE2d 845) (2023). We granted Appellant’s petition for a writ of\\ncertiorari on October 11, 2023. The case was docketed to the term of this Court\\nbeginning in December 2023, and oral argument was held on February 8, 2024.\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union of\\nGeorgia filed a joint brief as amici on behalf of Appellant. The Georgia\\nAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers also filed a separate amicus brief on\\nbehalf of Appellant. We thank them for their assistance.\\n      2 Appellant’s counsel previously argued that the seizure was unlawful\\n\\nbut conceded in his briefing to the Court of Appeals and during oral argument\\nbefore this Court that Appellant’s cell phone was lawfully seized.\\n      3 As a general matter, “[w]e have said that because Paragraph XIII\\n\\ncontains the same language as the Fourth Amendment, it is to be applied in\\naccord with the Fourth Amendment.” Olevik v. State, 302 Ga. 228, 234 (2) (b)\\n\\n                                      2\\n the trial court denied his motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\\n\\nSee Tatum v. State, 367 Ga. App. 439 (886 SE2d 845) (2023). In its\\n\\nanalysis, the Court of Appeals assumed without deciding that the\\n\\narresting officer’s warrantless viewing of the video on Appellant’s\\n\\ncell phone constituted an illegal search, but it nevertheless\\n\\nconcluded that evidence from Appellant’s cell phone was admissible\\n\\nunder the independent source doctrine. Id. at 442. The Court of\\n\\nAppeals reasoned that the affidavit made in support of the warrant\\n\\napplication contained evidence sufficient to support a finding of\\n\\nprobable cause even after excising information gleaned from the\\n\\narresting officer’s warrantless search. See id. at 442-443.\\n\\n     We granted certiorari and posed the following question:\\n\\n     Does the independent source doctrine allow the admission\\n     of cell-phone evidence obtained via search warrant\\n     without consideration of whether the decision to seek the\\n\\nn.3 (806 SE2d 505) (2017) (citation and punctuation omitted). Although\\nAppellant references both provisions on appeal, he makes no argument that\\nParagraph XIII should be interpreted as “‘provid[ing] a rule substantively\\ndifferent as applied to this case from that of the Fourth Amendment. This case\\ntherefore presents no occasion for consideration of whether Paragraph XIII\\ndiffers from the Fourth Amendment in some circumstances.’” Hinkson v. State,\\n310 Ga. 388, 398 n.5 (5) (a) (850 SE2d 41) (2020) (quoting White v. State, 307\\nGa. 601, 602 n.2 (2) (837 SE2d 838) (2020)).\\n\\n                                      3\\n      search warrant was prompted by a prior, warrantless\\n     search of that cell-phone?\\n\\nAppellant argues, and the State concedes,4 that courts must consider\\n\\nwhether the State’s decision to seek a search warrant was so\\n\\nprompted. Because the record on appeal does not reflect that the\\n\\ntrial court considered whether the warrant application was\\n\\nprompted in this way, we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals\\n\\nand remand with direction to vacate the judgment of the trial court\\n\\nand to remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with\\n\\nthis opinion.\\n\\n     1. (a) At the pre-trial motion to suppress hearing, the State\\n\\ncalled Deputy Will Townsend, who testified regarding his arrest of\\n\\nAppellant    and     the    circumstances       surrounding       it.   Deputy\\n\\nTownsend’s body-worn camera recorded his interactions with\\n\\nAppellant, as described further below. This video was admitted into\\n\\nevidence at the motion to suppress hearing and played for the court.\\n\\n\\n     4 The State argued it in its brief that we should affirm the decision of the\\n\\nCourt of Appeals but conceded at oral argument before this Court that we\\nshould vacate the Court of Appeals’s decision and remand for further\\nproceedings.\\n                                       4\\n Following the trial court’s denial of Appellant’s motion to suppress,\\n\\nthe parties filed stipulations concerning essentially all of the factual\\n\\nissues in the case, including the victim’s call to 911, Deputy\\n\\nTownsend’s encounter with and arrest of Appellant, Deputy\\n\\nTownsend’s warrantless viewing of an incriminating video on\\n\\nAppellant’s phone, facts relating to the warrant application, and a\\n\\ndescription of photographs and of a video of the victim obtained\\n\\npursuant to the warrant-authorized search. Rather than re-\\n\\nintroduce Deputy Townsend’s testimony and the recording from his\\n\\nbody-worn camera at trial, the State relied entirely upon these\\n\\nstipulations. Accordingly, no evidence was admitted by either party\\n\\nduring the guilt phase of Appellant’s bench trial.\\n\\n      Evidence from Deputy Townsend’s testimony, his body-worn\\n\\ncamera, and the parties’ stipulations was largely consistent and\\n\\nshows the following. On July 15, 2018, at 10:34 p.m., 5 the Madison\\n\\n\\n      5 The parties jointly stipulated that the call was received at 10:34 p.m.,\\n\\nbut the warrant affidavit states that the call was received at 10:41 p.m., and\\nDeputy Townsend testified that the call was received around 11:30 p.m. A\\nrecording of the 911 call is not a part of the record on appeal, and the timing of\\nthe call is not material to our legal analysis.\\n                                        5\\n County 911 call center received a call regarding an unknown\\n\\nindividual taking photographs of an 18-year-old female through a\\n\\nbedroom window. The caller described the individual’s cell phone as\\n\\nhaving a camera lens in the back center of the phone. Deputy\\n\\nTownsend was on duty in the area and was dispatched to respond to\\n\\nthe call.\\n\\n     Within minutes of the 911 call, Deputy Townsend encountered\\n\\nAppellant walking in the vicinity of the home from which the call\\n\\nhad been made. According to Deputy Townsend, who stated that he\\n\\nregularly patrolled this portion of Madison County, it was unusual\\n\\nfor there to be foot traffic in the area at this time of night. Upon\\n\\nencountering Appellant, Deputy Townsend got out of his vehicle and\\n\\nspoke to him. Deputy Townsend told Appellant about the 911 call\\n\\nand asked Appellant if he had a cell phone with him. Though\\n\\nAppellant denied having a cell phone on him, Deputy Townsend\\n\\nobserved the outline of an object that appeared to be a cell phone in\\n\\nAppellant’s front pants pocket. When Deputy Townsend asked\\n\\nAppellant about the object, Appellant pulled out his cell phone and\\n\\n                                 6\\n stated that he had forgotten that he had it with him. Deputy\\n\\nTownsend noticed that Appellant was shaking and that he appeared\\n\\nextremely nervous. Deputy Townsend also noticed that Appellant’s\\n\\nphone had a camera lens in the back center of the phone, as\\n\\ndescribed in the 911 call.\\n\\n     Deputy Townsend asked if Appellant would show him the last\\n\\nphotograph he had taken. Appellant initially declined, but after\\n\\nDeputy Townsend told Appellant that he could detain him and\\n\\nobtain a search warrant, Appellant agreed. As Appellant was\\n\\npulling up the gallery of photos on his phone, he tilted his phone\\n\\naway from the deputy, preventing the deputy from seeing its screen.\\n\\nAccording to Deputy Townsend, Appellant appeared as if he was\\n\\ntrying to delete something, and so Deputy Townsend “grabbed the\\n\\nphone out of his hand” to “preserve the evidence.” Immediately after\\n\\nseizing Appellant’s phone, and without interacting with it further,\\n\\nDeputy Townsend saw that the phone’s camera roll was displayed,\\n\\nand he observed a thumbnail image of a young woman standing in\\n\\na room through a window. Deputy Townsend put Appellant’s phone\\n\\n                                 7\\n down on the front seat of his patrol vehicle, handcuffed Appellant,\\n\\nand placed him in the back of the vehicle but left the door open.\\n\\nWhen placing Appellant in the back seat of his patrol vehicle,\\n\\nDeputy Townsend stated, “You are not under arrest at this point,\\n\\nbut you are being detained right now.” Once Appellant was seated,\\n\\nDeputy Townsend picked up Appellant’s cell phone, clicked on the\\n\\nthumbnail image he had seen while seizing Appellant’s phone and\\n\\nwatched the corresponding video, which depicted a female standing\\n\\nin a bedroom, with her breasts exposed, folding laundry. Deputy\\n\\nTownsend then locked the screen and did not search the cell phone\\n\\nany further. Deputy Townsend then closed the back door of his\\n\\npatrol car, placed Appellant under arrest, and provided him with a\\n\\nMiranda warning. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (86 SCt\\n\\n1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966).\\n\\n     Following Appellant’s arrest, law enforcement officers drafted\\n\\na search warrant application for the phone’s digital contents. The\\n\\naffidavit in support of the warrant included much of the information\\n\\nsummarized above, including the fact that Deputy Townsend viewed\\n\\n                                 8\\n a video on Appellant’s phone, which depicted “a topless white female\\n\\ninside her room being videoed from outside.” The warrant\\n\\napplication was granted, and, on execution of the warrant,\\n\\ninvestigators found photographs and a video of the victim on\\n\\nAppellant’s phone.\\n\\n     (b) As recounted above, the trial court denied Appellant’s\\n\\nmotion to suppress by means of summary order, which included no\\n\\nfindings of fact. Following Appellant’s bench trial, the court found\\n\\nAppellant guilty of a “peeping Tom” violation (Count 1) and invasion\\n\\nof privacy (Count 2), but not guilty of tampering with evidence\\n\\n(Count 3). Appellant then appealed his conviction to the Court of\\n\\nAppeals.\\n\\n     The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s denial of\\n\\nAppellant’s motion to suppress. See Tatum, 367 Ga. App. at 443-444.\\n\\nQuoting Brundige v. State, 291 Ga. 677, 682 (735 SE2d 583) (2012),\\n\\nthe Court of Appeals stated that “[w]hen faced with potentially\\n\\nimproperly obtained evidence, the question becomes whether,\\n\\nexcising   the   evidence   improperly   obtained,   probable   cause\\n\\n                                  9\\n nonetheless exists to issue a warrant.” Id. at 442 (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). In applying this rule, the Court of Appeals\\n\\nassumed without deciding that Deputy Townsend’s warrantless\\n\\nviewing of the video on Appellant’s cell phone constituted an\\n\\nunlawful search. 6 See id. It then considered other facts contained in\\n\\nthe affidavit, including Appellant’s proximity to the scene of the\\n\\ncrime, his dishonesty about having his phone with him, and his\\n\\nfurtive movements in an apparent attempt to delete evidence, and\\n\\nconcluded that these facts — all of which occurred prior to Deputy\\n\\nTownsend’s unlawful viewing of the phone’s contents — were\\n\\nsufficient to support a finding of probable cause, independent of any\\n\\nunlawfully obtained information.

Ohio, 367\\n\\nU.S. 643, 655 (III) (81 SCt 1684, 6 LE2d 1081) (1961) (applying the\\n\\nfederal exclusionary rule to the states through the Fourteenth\\n\\nAmendment to the United States Constitution); Mobley v. State, 307\\n\\nGa. 59, 75 (4) (a) (834 SE2d 785) (2019) (holding that OCGA\\n\\n§ 17-5-30 “establishes a procedure for applying the exclusionary\\n\\nrule” developed by the United States Supreme Court in state\\n\\ncriminal proceedings). The United States Supreme Court has\\n\\nrecognized certain exceptions to the exclusionary rule, however,\\n\\nunder which impermissibly obtained evidence may remain\\n\\nadmissible: one such exception is the independent source doctrine.\\n\\nSee Murray, 487 U.S. 533, 537 (II) (108 SCt 2529, 101 LEd2d 472)\\n\\n(1988) (citing Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S.\\n\\n385, 392 (40 SCt 182, 64 LEd 319) (1920)). As the Supreme Court\\n\\nexplained in Murray, the independent source doctrine applies “to\\n\\n                                11\\n evidence initially discovered during, or as a consequence of, an\\n\\nunlawful search, but later obtained independently from activities\\n\\nuntainted by the initial illegality.” Id. See also Wilder v. State, 290\\n\\nGa. 13, 16 (2) (717 SE2d 457) (2011) (explaining that the\\n\\nindependent source doctrine “operates when evidence discovered as\\n\\nthe result of an initial unlawful search is later discovered in a second\\n\\nsearch conducted by lawful means using information gained\\n\\nindependently of the initial search”).\\n\\n     In Murray, the United States Supreme Court held that the\\n\\nindependent source doctrine does not apply if the decision to seek\\n\\nthe warrant “was prompted” by information obtained during a prior\\n\\nunlawful search or if information obtained during that unlawful\\n\\nsearch “was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to\\n\\nissue the warrant.” Murray, 487 U.S. at 542 (III). In Murray, federal\\n\\nagents forced entry into a warehouse believed to contain illegal\\n\\ndrugs without a warrant. See id. at 535 (I). Upon entry, the agents\\n\\nnoted that the warehouse was unoccupied and observed “in plain\\n\\nview numerous burlap-wrapped bales.” Id. The agents left the\\n\\n                                  12\\n warehouse and kept it under surveillance while they applied for and\\n\\nultimately obtained a warrant several hours later. See id. at 535-\\n\\n536 (I). The warrant application “did not mention the prior entry[ ]\\n\\nand did not rely on any observations made during that entry.” Id. at\\n\\n536 (I). After the warrant was issued, agents immediately reentered\\n\\nthe warehouse and seized numerous bales of marijuana and\\n\\nnotebooks containing information regarding the customers to whom\\n\\nthe marijuana was to be shipped. See id. The defendants filed a\\n\\nmotion to suppress evidence obtained from the agent’s warrant-\\n\\nauthorized search on the ground that it was tainted by the agents’\\n\\nprior unlawful search. See id. The trial court denied the defendants’\\n\\nmotion, and the appellate court affirmed, but the United States\\n\\nSupreme Court granted certiorari, vacated, and remanded for a\\n\\nfactual determination of whether the agents’ decision to seek a\\n\\nwarrant was prompted by their prior unlawful search. See id. at 536\\n\\n(I), 543-544 (III).\\n\\n     Though decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the\\n\\nEleventh Circuit are not binding on this Court, see State v.\\n\\n                                 13\\n Rosenbaum, 305 Ga. 442, 449-450 (2) (826 SE2d 18) (2019), we take\\n\\nnote of two recent Eleventh Circuit cases applying Murray: United\\n\\nStates v. Barron-Soto, 820 F3d 409 (11th Cir. 2016) and United\\n\\nStates v. Noriega, 676 F3d 1252 (11th Cir. 2012). In both cases, the\\n\\nEleventh Circuit assessed the applicability of the independent\\n\\nsource doctrine using a two-part test. See Barron-Soto, 820 F3d at\\n\\n415 (III) (A); Noriega, 676 F3d at 1260 (III) (C). The first part of the\\n\\ntest requires courts to “excise from the search warrant affidavit any\\n\\ninformation gained during the alleged illegal entry and determine\\n\\nwhether the remaining information supports a finding of probable\\n\\ncause.” Barron-Soto, 820 F3d at 415 (III) (A). See Noriega, 676 F3d\\n\\nat 1260 (III) (C) (same). This part of the test addresses the Supreme\\n\\nCourt’s direction in Murray regarding whether unlawfully obtained\\n\\nevidence “was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision\\n\\nto issue the warrant.” Murray, 487 U.S. at 542 (III). If, after excising\\n\\ninformation regarding unlawfully obtained evidence from the\\n\\nwarrant affidavit, the remaining evidence is sufficient to support a\\n\\nfinding of probable cause, courts reach the second part of the test, in\\n\\n                                  14\\n which they must “determine whether the officer’s decision to obtain\\n\\na search warrant was ‘prompted by’ what he observed during the\\n\\nillegal entry.” Barron-Soto, 820 F3d at 415 (III) (A) (quoting Murray,\\n\\n487 U.S. at 543 (III)); see Noriega, 676 F3d at 1260 (III) (C) (same).\\n\\nWhen applying the second part of this test, the Eleventh Circuit asks\\n\\n“whether the officer would have sought the warrant even if he had\\n\\nnot” engaged in the prior unlawful search. Noriega, 676 F3d at 1260-\\n\\n161 (III) (C).\\n\\n     Unlike the Eleventh Circuit, this Court has not expressly\\n\\nstated that the independent source doctrine requires consideration\\n\\nof whether the decision to seek a search warrant was prompted by a\\n\\nprior unlawful search. In most of our past cases, however, we have\\n\\neither engaged with this consideration implicitly or resolved the\\n\\nissue in such a way that the officer’s motivation in seeking the\\n\\nwarrant was not the determinative issue. See, e.g., State v. Lejeune,\\n\\n277 Ga. 749, 753-755 (3) (A) (594 SE2d 637) (2004) (holding that the\\n\\nindependent source doctrine was applicable where evidence was\\n\\nfirst obtained pursuant to a warrant unsupported by probable cause,\\n\\n                                 15\\n but after that first warrant was held invalid, the State gave a\\n\\nredacted version of the case file to a new investigator who lacked\\n\\nparticular knowledge of the prior evidence and who later obtained\\n\\nsimilar evidence based on an independent source pursuant to a\\n\\nsecond, lawful warrant); Wilder, 290 Ga. at 16-17 (2) (holding,\\n\\nwithout consideration of the State’s motivations for pursuing the\\n\\nwarrant, that the independent source doctrine did not apply to\\n\\nevidence found in a briefcase that was unlawfully seized but lawfully\\n\\nsearched pursuant to a warrant based on information independent\\n\\nof the seizure); Price v. State, 270 Ga. 619, 622-623 (2) (513 SE2d\\n\\n483) (1999) (applying the independent source doctrine without\\n\\nconsideration of the State’s motivations for pursuing a warrant, but\\n\\ndoing so only in dicta after concluding that the search and seizure of\\n\\nevidence were lawful on other grounds).\\n\\n     We are aware of two cases where we seemingly applied the\\n\\nindependent source doctrine without considering whether the\\n\\nState’s decision to seek a warrant was prompted by a prior unlawful\\n\\nsearch: Reaves v. State, 284 Ga. 181 (664 SE2d 211) (2008) and\\n\\n                                 16\\n Brundige v. State, 291 Ga. 677 (735 SE2d 583) (2012). But those\\n\\ncases do not foreclose the holdings we explain below. In Reaves, we\\n\\nappeared to apply the independent source doctrine without\\n\\nconsideration of whether the State was prompted to seek a warrant\\n\\nby a prior unlawful search, and without other facts or analysis that\\n\\nmade clear why this consideration was unnecessary. See Reaves, 284\\n\\nGa. at 183-184 (2) (c). The analysis of the independent source\\n\\ndoctrine in Reaves was scant, however, and nothing said there\\n\\nrequires us to forgo application of the analysis called for by Murray.\\n\\nSee id.\\n\\n     In Brundige, we did not expressly apply the independent\\n\\nsource doctrine, but we did allow the admission of evidence obtained\\n\\nby means of a warrant-authorized search without addressing\\n\\nwhether it was prompted by a prior search held to be unlawful.\\n\\nThere, the State suspected that a home was being used as a grow-\\n\\nhouse for marijuana. See Brundige, 291 Ga. at 677. The State\\n\\nobtained a search warrant to use a thermal camera to detect\\n\\nanomalous heat associated with growing activities. See id. at 678.\\n\\n                                 17\\n After the State’s thermal search of the building revealed heat\\n\\nconsistent with grow-lights, the State applied for a second warrant\\n\\nto search the building’s interior. See id. The State’s second warrant\\n\\naffidavit contained all the information from the first affidavit, plus\\n\\nadditional information resulting from the State’s thermal search.\\n\\nSee id. On review of a challenge from the defendant, this Court held\\n\\nthat the State’s first search was unlawful for statutory, rather than\\n\\nconstitutional reasons: at the time of the search, OCGA\\n\\n§ 17-5-21 (a) (5) permitted the search and seizure only of “tangible”\\n\\nthings, and heat, we concluded, was not tangible within the meaning\\n\\nof the statute. 7 See id. at 680. We nevertheless held that the second\\n\\nsearch was lawful, because, even after excising all information\\n\\nobtained during the first search from the second search warrant\\n\\naffidavit, there was sufficient information to support a finding of\\n\\nprobable cause. See id. at 682. Though Brundige failed to consider\\n\\n\\n      7 OCGA § 17-5-21 (a) (5) has since been amended to permit the search\\n\\nand seizure of “anything that is tangible or intangible, corporeal or incorporeal,\\nvisible or invisible evidence of the commission of a crime for which probable\\ncause is shown, other than the private papers of any person.” Ga. L. 2015, p.\\n1047, § 3.\\n                                       18\\n whether the second search was prompted by the first, it is\\n\\ndistinguishable from the instant case. Because the first search\\n\\nwarrant was invalid for statutory reasons, Brundige does not\\n\\nexpressly ground itself on any constitutional issue, and therefore\\n\\ndoes not directly involve the Fourth Amendment, the federal\\n\\nexclusionary rule, or exceptions to that rule.8 Accordingly, it does not\\n\\naffect our decision here.\\n\\n     After consideration of Murray, persuasive authority from the\\n\\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and our own prior case law, we\\n\\nrecognize the following. When applying the independent source\\n\\ndoctrine, we are bound to follow Murray and therefore must consider\\n\\nwhether the State’s decision to seek a warrant for evidence\\n\\npreviously obtained through unlawful means was prompted by the\\n\\nprior unlawful search. See Murray, 487 U.S. at 542 (III). We\\n\\nconclude that the Eleventh Circuit’s decisions in Barron-Soto and\\n\\nNoriega are persuasive as faithful applications of Murray. See\\n\\n\\n     8 As noted below, see n.10, infra, to the extent Brundige can be read as\\n\\nhaving applied the independent source doctrine, we disapprove of it as\\ninconsistent with the analysis required in Murray.\\n                                    19\\n Barron-Soto, 820 F3d at 415 (III) (A); Noriega, 676 F3d at 1260-161\\n\\n(III) (C). Accordingly, we hold, like the Eleventh Circuit, that if the\\n\\nState would have sought the warrant even without the prior\\n\\nillegality, then its decision was not prompted by the prior unlawful\\n\\nsearch. See Noriega, 676 F3d at 1260-161 (III) (C). But if the State\\n\\nwould not have sought the warrant but for its prior unlawful\\n\\nactivities, then the warrant was so prompted, and the evidence is\\n\\nnot admissible under the independent source doctrine. 9 See id. This\\n\\nis a mixed question of fact and law. As the Supreme Court reasoned\\n\\nin Murray, the purpose of the independent source doctrine is to\\n\\n“put[ ] the police in the same, not a worse, position than they would\\n\\nhave been in if no police error or misconduct had occurred.” Murray\\n\\n487 U.S. at 537 (II) (quoting Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 443 (II)\\n\\n(B) (104 SCt 2501, 81 LE2d 377) (1984)). By the same token, the\\n\\npolice should not be in a better position because of their misconduct.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      9 Nothing we have said here obviates the need for courts to consider\\n\\nwhether, after excising any unlawfully obtained information from the warrant\\naffidavit, information sufficient to support a finding of probable cause remains.\\nSee Barron-Soto, 820 F3d at 415 (III) (A); Noriega, 676 F3d at 1260 (III) (C).\\n                                       20\\n The rule from Murray serves both of these aims: if the second, lawful\\n\\nsearch was not prompted by the prior unlawful search, then the\\n\\nindependent source doctrine applies, and the State is in the same\\n\\nposition it would have been in if the unlawful conduct had not\\n\\noccurred. But if the second search was prompted by the original\\n\\nunlawful search, then the evidence must be excluded so that the\\n\\nState does not benefit from its unlawful conduct. Under such\\n\\ncircumstances, the independent source doctrine should not and\\n\\ncannot apply.10\\n\\n      (b) We now turn back to the facts of this case, as stipulated by\\n\\nthe parties. Here, Deputy Townsend seized Appellant’s phone based\\n\\non his belief that Appellant was attempting to delete evidence. As\\n\\nnoted above, Appellant no longer contests the lawfulness of this\\n\\nseizure. See n.2, supra. Deputy Townsend then viewed the digital\\n\\ncontents of Appellant’s cell phone twice. First, immediately after\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      10 As a result of our holding, we disapprove of Reaves and Brundige to\\n\\nthe extent that either decision can be read as applying the independent source\\ndoctrine without engaging in this type of consideration.\\n\\n                                     21\\n seizing Appellant’s phone, and without manipulating it, Deputy\\n\\nTownsend saw a thumbnail image of a woman displayed on\\n\\nAppellant’s screen. Second, after securing the phone and detaining\\n\\nAppellant, Deputy Townsend picked Appellant’s phone back up and\\n\\nviewed a video recording of the victim “standing in a bedroom, with\\n\\nher breasts exposed, folding laundry.” The parties dispute whether\\n\\nDeputy Townsend’s initial viewing of the thumbnail image\\n\\nconstituted an unlawful search, but the State concedes that Deputy\\n\\nTownsend’s subsequent viewing of the video was unlawful. The\\n\\nState also conceded at oral argument before this Court that proper\\n\\napplication   of   the   independent   source   doctrine   requires\\n\\nconsideration of whether an officer’s decision to seek a search\\n\\nwarrant was prompted by an earlier, unlawful search.\\n\\n     Because the State was correct to make this concession, as\\n\\nexplained above, we must consider how to rule on the record before\\n\\nus, as the trial court’s summary order denying Appellant’s motion to\\n\\nsuppress did not include express findings of fact or conclusions of\\n\\nlaw. The State suggested at oral argument before this Court that we\\n\\n                                22\\n should remand to allow the trial court to determine whether the\\n\\nState’s decision to seek a search warrant was prompted by Deputy\\n\\nTownsend’s prior unlawful search. Appellant instead asks us to\\n\\nreverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and vacate his\\n\\nconviction. Though we may consider “the pretrial testimony adduced\\n\\nat the suppression hearing, as well as the trial transcript,” when a\\n\\ntrial court declines to make express findings of fact, and we are\\n\\nrequired to “construe the evidence most favorably to uphold the trial\\n\\ncourt’s judgment,” Jones v. State, 314 Ga. 605, 609 (2) (878 SE2d\\n\\n505) (2022), the record on appeal remains insufficient to make this\\n\\ndetermination. See Murray, 487 U.S. at 543-544 (III) (remanding for\\n\\nthe trial court to determine, in the first instance, whether the\\n\\nwarrant-authorized search was prompted by the prior unlawful\\n\\nsearch). We accordingly vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals\\n\\nand remand to that court with instructions to vacate the judgment\\n\\nof the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with\\n\\nthis opinion. See Williams v. State, 301 Ga. 60, 62 (799 SE2d 779)\\n\\n(2017) (vacating with direction to remand to the trial court for\\n\\n                                 23\\n clarification “[g]iven the uncertainty in the trial court’s order\\n\\n[regarding the defendant’s motion to suppress]”); Parker v. State,\\n\\n255 Ga. 167, 168 (1) (336 SE2d 242) (1985) (remanding for\\n\\nclarification and further hearings, if necessary, because the “the\\n\\ncourt’s rulings [were] unclear”). Cf. Hughes v.

RICHARDSON v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       LAGRUA, Justice.\\n\\n       Appellant Matthew Richardson appeals his convictions for\\n\\nfelony murder and other crimes related to the shooting death of\\n\\nJulius Aderhold, III. 1 Richardson contends that (1) the trial court\\n\\ncommitted plain error when it admitted testimony of a detective that\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 The crimes occurred in Atlanta on January 30, 2018. On May 1, 2018,\\n\\na Fulton County grand jury indicted Richardson for felony murder predicated\\non aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Count 1), two counts of\\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon upon Jabari Johnson and Airieon\\nYoung (Counts 2 and 3), terroristic threats (Count 4), and possession of a\\nfirearm during the commission of a felony (Count 5). Richardson was tried in\\nNovember 2019, and the jury found him guilty of all counts. The trial court\\nsentenced Richardson to serve life in prison with the possibility of parole on\\nCount 1, a consecutive five-year term in prison on Count 5, and 20 years in\\nprison to run concurrent on Counts 2, 3, and 4. Richardson filed a timely\\nmotion for new trial, which was amended through new counsel. After holding\\nan evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion for new trial on June\\n6, 2023. Richardson filed a timely notice of appeal, and his case was docketed\\nto this Court’s term beginning in December 2023 and submitted for a decision\\non the briefs.\\n improperly     bolstered     out-of-court    statements      by   two    other\\n\\nwitnesses; and (2) his trial counsel provided constitutionally\\n\\nineffective assistance by failing to object to that same testimony.2\\n\\nFor the reasons explained below, we affirm.\\n\\n      1. This case involves a drive-by shooting on January 30, 2018,\\n\\nduring which Richardson’s friend and passenger Aderhold was shot\\n\\nand killed. The evidence presented at trial showed that Richardson\\n\\nwas upset with Jabari Johnson for his alleged involvement in\\n\\nstealing a gun belonging to Richardson’s cousin. Johnson testified\\n\\nthat, on January 29, Richardson called Johnson’s girlfriend and\\n\\nasked about the stolen gun. The next day, January 30, Richardson\\n\\nvisited Johnson’s house. Discovering that only Johnson’s two sisters\\n\\nwere home, Richardson called Johnson on the phone while standing\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 Richardson also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\\n\\nhis conviction for terroristic threats. However, although he lists that claim as\\none of his enumerated errors, he presents no legal argument or citation of\\nauthority in support. Thus, this contention is deemed abandoned. See former\\nSupreme Court Rule 22 (2023) (“Any enumerated error not supported by\\nargument or citation of authority in the brief shall be deemed abandoned. . .\\n.”). See also Smith v. State, \\n315 Ga. 357\\n, 358 n.2 (\\n882 SE2d 289\\n) (2022)\\n(deeming abandoned under former Rule 22 an unsupported claim of error\\npertaining to the sufficiency of the evidence).\\n                                       2\\n by the front door. Johnson and his two sisters testified that\\n\\nRichardson threatened Johnson during the call, telling him,\\n\\n“Somebody about to die about this gun today. I could kill your sister\\n\\nright now.” All three also testified that Richardson said he was going\\n\\nto go to the house of Johnson’s friend Aireon Young to “shoot it up.”\\n\\nAfter ten minutes of arguing with Johnson over the phone,\\n\\nRichardson left Johnson’s house.\\n\\n     At another point that afternoon at Young’s house, the mother\\n\\nof Young’s child was upstairs and saw a man standing outside the\\n\\nfront door holding a gun. She did not answer the door, but she called\\n\\nYoung and said a man was there with a gun. The man left by the\\n\\nend of this phone call. Young later told investigators that this man\\n\\nwas Richardson based on what his child’s mother told him, but at\\n\\ntrial, both Young and his child’s mother testified that they did not\\n\\nknow if the man was Richardson.\\n\\n     During these phone calls to Young and Johnson, Young was\\n\\ndriving Johnson and their friend Marquise Arnold to pick up\\n\\nArnold’s paycheck. In response to Richardson’s threats against\\n\\n                                   3\\n Johnson and Young, Young called Richardson to see what the\\n\\nproblem was. After that phone call, Young changed course and drove\\n\\nhome. Young’s mother, his young child, and his child’s mother were\\n\\npresent at the house. After Young, Johnson, and Arnold arrived,\\n\\nYoung’s family and Arnold went upstairs because Young told them\\n\\nRichardson was coming with a gun. Johnson went to the kitchen,\\n\\nand Young stood in front of the house talking on the phone with\\n\\nRichardson. Within minutes, Richardson drove an SUV into Young’s\\n\\nneighborhood. Aderhold was in the front passenger seat of the SUV,\\n\\nfacing the side of the street Young’s house was on.\\n\\n     Testimony at trial diverged about what happened next.\\n\\nJohnson testified that he heard approximately three gunshots while\\n\\ninside the house, grabbed a pistol, exited through the back door, and\\n\\nran along the side of the house to the front. On the street in front of\\n\\nthe house, Johnson saw Richardson leaning out of an SUV shooting\\n\\na handgun at him and Young. Johnson also witnessed Young\\n\\nshooting at Richardson, and Johnson began shooting at Richardson\\n\\nas well until his gun jammed, at which point he ran inside the house,\\n\\n                                  4\\n reloaded, and then ran back outside through the front door. Johnson\\n\\ntestified that he did not see who started shooting first because he\\n\\nwas inside; he did not know whether it was Richardson or Young.\\n\\n     Young testified that, while he was standing in front of his\\n\\nhouse, he saw Richardson driving up in an SUV and heard gunshots\\n\\ncoming from the direction of the street where the SUV was driving.\\n\\nYoung assumed Richardson was shooting at him, although he could\\n\\nnot see whether Richardson had a gun. Young began shooting at the\\n\\nSUV. At that moment, Young could not see Johnson, but believed he\\n\\nwas outside by the side of the house when the shooting began,\\n\\nexplaining that he thought so “because [Johnson was] still over\\n\\nthere, like, spazzing out and stuff, pacing back and forth . . . . talking\\n\\nto himself and stuff.” Young testified that, two months later,\\n\\nJohnson told him that he was the one who started shooting first, not\\n\\nRichardson. Johnson testified that he never told Young that he shot\\n\\nfirst and noted that he and Young were no longer friends due to a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    5\\n later incident.3\\n\\n      According to testimony from Young, Johnson, and others in the\\n\\nneighborhood, Richardson stopped the SUV a few houses away,\\n\\nexited, and ran to a neighbor’s house to find help. Young and\\n\\nJohnson went back inside Young’s house and waited for police to\\n\\narrive. Richardson got back in the SUV, but a police officer\\n\\nresponding to the scene stopped and apprehended him before he\\n\\ncould leave the neighborhood. The officer found Aderhold dead in the\\n\\npassenger seat, bleeding from a gunshot wound.\\n\\n      Investigators retrieved a .38-caliber revolver from behind the\\n\\ndriver’s seat in the SUV and a .40-caliber pistol underneath\\n\\nAderhold’s body. The gun behind the driver’s seat contained five\\n\\nspent shell casings, but the gun underneath Aderhold was fully\\n\\nloaded. Investigators also retrieved a 9mm pistol from Young and a\\n\\n.45-caliber pistol from Johnson. Several 9mm and .45-caliber casings\\n\\nwere recovered from the scene. The medical examiner testified that\\n\\n\\n      3 During trial, Young testified that he faced murder charges for a later,\\n\\nunrelated shooting. Johnson testified that he was also involved in that shooting\\nbut was not charged.\\n                                       6\\n Aderhold’s cause of death was a .45-caliber bullet that entered\\n\\nthrough his right shoulder and penetrated his head. Of the three\\n\\nshooters, only Johnson used a .45-caliber pistol.\\n\\n     That evening, Young and Johnson were taken to the police\\n\\nstation where Detective Nikita Moss interviewed them separately\\n\\nafter they waived their Miranda 4 rights. 5 During his interview,\\n\\nJohnson said that he heard gunshots while inside Young’s house,\\n\\nran outside through the back door, and began shooting back.\\n\\nAdditionally, Johnson told Detective Moss during his interview that\\n\\nthe initial “three shots didn’t come from [Young’s] gun.” At trial,\\n\\nJohnson gave a similar account and admitted that he implicated\\n\\nRichardson, but he testified that he did not know who shot first.\\n\\n     During Young’s interview, he told Detective Moss that he saw\\n\\nRichardson driving down the street “flashing” a handgun and that\\n\\nhe saw Richardson shoot first. At trial, Young admitted he told\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     4 Miranda v. Arizona, \\n384 U.S. 436\\n (86 SCt 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966).\\n     5 Young, Johnson, and Detective Moss testified regarding Young’s and\\n\\nJohnson’s out-of-court interview statements, and a video of Young’s interview\\nwas played for the jury. «T10 1166-67, 1234, 1248, 1257»\\n                                     7\\n Detective Moss that Richardson shot first, but he repeatedly\\n\\ntestified that he lied during that interview and did not actually see\\n\\nwho shot first.\\n\\n     While under direct examination at trial, Detective Moss\\n\\ntestified as follows regarding her interviews of Young and Johnson:\\n\\n     STATE:       What about Dominique Young, while you\\n                  talked to him, did he talk freely to you?\\n     MOSS:        Yes.\\n     STATE:       Did he speak as if what he said was rehearsed?\\n     MOSS:        No.\\n     STATE:       Did every detail that he gave to you, did it\\n                  sound from talking with both Jabari Johnson\\n                  and Dominique Young as if they were\\n                  attempting to give you the same story?\\n     MOSS:        No, ma’am.\\n     STATE:       And why do you say that?\\n     MOSS:        From details that Dominique gave, some were\\n                  not the same as Jabari’s. For instance,\\n                  Dominique stated that Jabari was outside with\\n                  him and ran to the side of the house, but Jabari\\n                  said he walked outside when he heard the\\n                  shots, ran back through the house to the side of\\n                  the house.\\n     STATE:       And were both of them talking about various\\n                  times? Like, in other words, as they are talking\\n                  to you, are they talking conversationally?\\n     MOSS:        Yes.\\n     STATE:       Okay. And did they seem as if they were\\n                  searching for what the truth was while they\\n                  were talking to you?\\n\\n                                    8\\n      MOSS:      Yes.\\n     STATE:     Did they seem to have trouble figuring out or\\n                telling you what the truth was?\\n     MOSS:      What do you mean?\\n     STATE:     What I mean is, did they seem to have any\\n                trouble telling you what they were recounting?\\n     MOSS:      No.\\n     STATE:     And was the information that they were\\n                recounting coming freely?\\n     MOSS:      Yes.\\n\\nRichardson’s trial counsel did not object to this testimony.\\n\\n     2. On appeal, Richardson contends that—when Detective Moss\\n\\nanswered “yes” to the prosecutor’s question, “Did they seem as if\\n\\nthey were searching for what the truth was while they were talking\\n\\nto you?”—Detective Moss improperly bolstered Young’s and\\n\\nJohnson’s interview statements that Richardson shot at them first\\n\\nand they only returned fire in self-defense. Richardson argues that\\n\\nthe trial court committed plain error by admitting Detective Moss’s\\n\\ntestimony at trial and that his trial counsel was ineffective for not\\n\\nobjecting to the testimony. We hold that Richardson has failed to\\n\\nshow plain error or ineffective assistance of counsel.\\n\\n     We have explained that, pursuant to OCGA § 24-6-620,\\n\\n\\n                                  9\\n      a witness, even an expert, can never bolster the credibility\\n     of another witness as to whether the witness is telling the\\n     truth. Credibility of a witness is not beyond the ken of the\\n     jurors but, to the contrary, is a matter solely within the\\n     province of the jury. When a witness’s statement does not\\n     directly address the credibility of another witness,\\n     however, there is no improper bolstering. And when we\\n     evaluate whether testimony constitutes improper\\n     bolstering, we consider the disputed testimony in context.\\n\\nBrown v. State, \\n302 Ga. 454\\n, 460-461 (2) (b) (\\n807 SE2d 369\\n) (2017)\\n\\n(citations and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     (a) We apply the plain-error standard to evidentiary rulings to\\n\\nwhich the appellant did not object at trial. Pender v. State, \\n311 Ga.\\n\\n98\\n, 111 (3) (\\n856 SE2d 302\\n) (2021); OCGA § 24-1-103 (d). To establish\\n\\nplain error, Richardson “must point to a legal error that was not\\n\\naffirmatively waived, was clear and obvious beyond reasonable\\n\\ndispute, affected his substantial rights, and seriously affected the\\n\\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.”\\n\\nCarter v. State, \\n317 Ga. 689\\n, 693 (2) (\\n895 SE2d 295\\n) (2023) (citations\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). However, if Richardson fails to show just\\n\\none of these elements, we need not analyze the rest. \\nId.\\n\\n\\n     Any error here was not clear and obvious beyond reasonable\\n\\n                                 10\\n dispute. “For an error to be obvious for purposes of plain-error\\n\\nreview, it must be plain under controlling precedent or in view of the\\n\\nunequivocally clear words of a statute or rule.” Grier v. State, \\n313\\n\\nGa. 236\\n, 242 (2) (b) (\\n869 SE2d 423\\n) (2022). We have interpreted\\n\\nOCGA § 24-6-620 to mean that a witness may not “directly address\\n\\nthe credibility of another. . . .” Brown, \\n302 Ga. at 460-461\\n (2) (b)\\n\\n(emphasis supplied). But our precedents permit a witness to still\\n\\ntestify about another witness’s statements in ways that do not\\n\\ndirectly comment on that witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Pender, 311\\n\\nGa. at 113 (3) (“While it would have been improper for the detective\\n\\nto testify about whether he believed [the witness] was telling the\\n\\ntruth, it was permissible for the detective to discuss whether [the\\n\\nwitness’s] statements to him . . . were consistent with other\\n\\ninformation. . . .”); Ivey v. State, \\n305 Ga. 156\\n, 161-162 (2) (c) (\\n824\\n\\nSE2d 242\\n) (2019) (holding that a detective’s testimony that the\\n\\ndefendant’s “demeanor changed . . . you could tell that the wheels\\n\\nwere turning” was not a “direct comment on [the defendant’s]\\n\\nveracity”); Harris v. State, \\n304 Ga. 652\\n, 657 (2) (c) (\\n821 SE2d 346\\n)\\n\\n                                 11\\n (2018) (holding that a detective’s testimony that shooting victims\\n\\n“tell you the whole story about what happened” and “that is basically\\n\\nthe pattern that [I] saw here” was not a direct comment on the victim\\n\\nwitness’s credibility). 6\\n\\n      Here, we consider the “disputed testimony in context.” Brown,\\n\\n302 Ga. at 461\\n (2) (b). Considering the other questions asked of\\n\\nDetective Moss, it appears her testimony only explained how Young\\n\\nand Johnson said what they said, which is not necessarily a direct\\n\\ncomment on their credibility. Indeed, the next question from the\\n\\nprosecutor was whether Young and Johnson had “trouble figuring\\n\\nout or telling you what the truth was,” which the prosecutor\\n\\nrephrased to, “What I mean is, did they seem to have any trouble\\n\\ntelling you what they were recounting?” Depending on context, a\\n\\nmere reference to “the truth” does not necessarily indicate direct\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 We note that this   Court has often used the words “credibility” and\\n“veracity” interchangeably in analyzing OCGA § 24-6-620. See, e.g., Harris,\\n304 Ga. at 657\\n (2) (c) (“Viewed in context, Detective Puhala’s testimony was\\nnot a direct comment on Ellison’s veracity. When a witness’s statement does\\nnot directly address the credibility of another witness, there is no improper\\nbolstering.” (citation and punctuation omitted)). In so doing, we have not\\nascribed different meanings to those words, and we likewise ascribe none here.\\n                                     12\\n testimony on whether one is telling the truth. See Bedford v. State,\\n\\n311 Ga. 329\\n, 335-336 (4) (\\n857 SE2d 708\\n) (2021) (holding that, in\\n\\ncontext, a witness’s testimony that “the truth stays very similar”\\n\\nwas not improper bolstering because it only addressed whether\\n\\nanother witness’s statements were consistent with other evidence),\\n\\ndisapproved of on other grounds in Clark v. State, \\n315 Ga. 423\\n, 436\\n\\n(3) (b) n.16 (\\n883 SE2d 317\\n) (2023). In context here, Detective Moss’s\\n\\nuse of the phrase “searching for what the truth was” did not directly\\n\\naddress the credibility of Young and Johnson but instead focused on\\n\\ntheir demeanors. See Ivey, \\n305 Ga. at 162\\n (2) (c). Accordingly, we\\n\\nhold that Detective Moss’s testimony was not a clear and obvious\\n\\ncase of improper bolstering, so Richardson has failed to establish\\n\\nplain error from the admission of this testimony. See Jones v. State,\\n\\n299 Ga. 40\\n, 44 (3) (\\n785 SE2d 886\\n) (2016).\\n\\n     (b) To show ineffective assistance of counsel for his trial\\n\\ncounsel’s failure to object to Detective Moss’s testimony, Richardson\\n\\n“must prove both that his trial counsel’s performance was deficient\\n\\nand that there is a reasonable probability that the trial result would\\n\\n                                 13\\n have been different if not for the deficient performance.” Harris, \\n304\\n\\nGa. at 654\\n (2) (citing Strickland v. Washington, \\n466 U.S. 668\\n (104\\n\\nSCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984)). As with plain error, if Richardson\\n\\nfails to meet the requirements of one element of the Strickland test,\\n\\nwe need not analyze the other. Harris, \\n304 Ga. at 654\\n (2).\\n\\n      We hold that Richardson has failed to show that his trial\\n\\ncounsel’s performance was deficient. “To satisfy the deficiency\\n\\nprong, [Richardson] must demonstrate that his attorney performed\\n\\nat trial in an objectively unreasonable way considering all the\\n\\ncircumstances and in the light of prevailing professional norms.”\\n\\nHarris v. State, \\n310 Ga. 372\\n, 384 (4) (\\n850 SE2d 77\\n) (2020) (citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted). We have already held that this testimony\\n\\nwas not a clear case of improper bolstering. Accordingly, we cannot\\n\\nsay that no reasonable lawyer would have failed to object to such\\n\\ntestimony on the grounds of improper bolstering.7 See Ivey, \\n305 Ga.\\n\\n\\n7\\n That Richardson’s trial counsel testified at the motion-for-new-trial\\nhearing that she now understood the statement to be bolstering and had no\\nstrategy behind failing to object does not change our analysis. Our standard is\\nobjective reasonableness and we are not constrained to “the subjective reasons\\n\\n                                      14\\n at 162 (2) (c) (“Because [the detective’s] testimony was not a direct\\n\\ncomment on Ivey’s veracity . . .

I concur with the denial of\\n\\ncertiorari because I agree that the municipal court could not order\\n\\nthe measures that it did, but for different reasons not discussed by\\n\\nthe Court of Appeals. See 400 Edgewood, LLC v. City of Atlanta, \\n369\\n\\nGa. App. 673\\n, 674 (\\n893 SE2d 156\\n) (2023).\\n\\n     The factual and procedural background as laid out by the Court\\n\\nof Appeals is as follows:\\n\\n           400 Edgewood, LLC (“Edgewood”), owns a gas\\n     station and convenience store located at 400 Edgewood\\n     Avenue (“the Property”) in downtown Atlanta. After\\n     numerous criminal incidents occurred on or near the\\n     Property, the City of Atlanta (“the City”) filed a complaint\\n     in rem to abate an alleged public nuisance at the Property\\n     pursuant to OCGA § 41-2-1 et seq., and the Atlanta\\n     Municipal Code Art. 1 §§ 19 and 25. Specifically, the City\\n     alleged that “it is the duty of the owners and occupants of\\n     any premises to maintain [the] property in a state of good\\n     repair and in conformance with State and local law and\\n     clear of any public or attractive nuisance.” The City\\n    alleged that the owner/occupiers of the Property “failed to\\n    discharge these duties” and that the “criminal and\\n    unlawful activity occurring at the subject Property”\\n    constituted a public nuisance. The City requested that the\\n    municipal court “close and immediately secure the\\n    Property so that it cannot be used in connection with the\\n    commission of illegal activity.”\\n\\n          After a hearing, the municipal court judge entered\\n    an order finding that “the evidence presented was\\n    insufficient to support a finding that the Property itself\\n    created a public nuisance[.]” . . . However, the municipal\\n    court also found that “the evidence support[ed] a finding\\n    that the operation of the business at the Property [was] a\\n    nuisance.” (Emphasis supplied.) The municipal court then\\n    ordered Edgewood to install additional security cameras,\\n    hire “competent security,” and reduce the hours of\\n    operation of the gas station and convenience store for one\\n    year.\\n\\n         Edgewood filed a petition for certiorari review in the\\n    superior court, which affirmed the municipal court's\\n    order. [The Court of Appeals] granted Edgewood's\\n    application for discretionary appeal[.]\\n\\nId. at 673-74 (citation and punctuation omitted). The Court of\\n\\nAppeals   reversed,   concluding    that    the      municipal   court\\n\\nimpermissibly   entered   injunctive   relief   by    “impos[ing]   an\\n\\naffirmative duty on Edgewood to both perform (by enhancing\\n\\nsecurity measures) and refrain from performing (by limiting the\\n\\n                                2\\n business’s hours of operation) specific acts.” Id. at 674 (citing Adams\\n\\nv. Madison County Planning & Zoning, \\n271 Ga. App. 333\\n, 334 (1)\\n\\n(\\n609 SE2d 681\\n) (2005) (“[I]njunctions are within the exclusive\\n\\njurisdiction of the superior and appellate courts.”)). Having so\\n\\nconcluded, the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to consider\\n\\nwhether “the municipal court exceeded its in rem authority under\\n\\nOCGA § 41-2-1 et seq.” Id. n.5.\\n\\n     It is difficult to see, however, how the Court of Appeals could\\n\\nconclude that the municipal court acted beyond its jurisdiction in\\n\\npurportedly abating the nuisance, without grappling with OCGA §\\n\\n41-2-5. OCGA § 41-2-5 provides: “If the existence of a nuisance is\\n\\ncomplained of in a county or city of this state, the municipal court of\\n\\nthe city, if the nuisance complained of is in the city, shall have\\n\\njurisdiction to hear and determine the question of the existence of\\n\\nsuch nuisance and, if found to exist, to order its abatement.”\\n\\n(emphasis added). We have long held that under OCGA § 41-2-5 and\\n\\nits predecessors, a municipal court has the power to abate nuisances.\\n\\nSee Horne v. City of Cordele, \\n254 Ga. 346\\n, 348 (2) (\\n329 SE2d 134\\n)\\n\\n                                  3\\n (1985) (acknowledging a recorder court’s “power to abate nuisances\\n\\npursuant to the legislative authorization in OCGA § 41-2-5”); City of\\n\\nAtlanta v. Wolcott, \\n240 Ga. 244\\n, 244 (\\n240 SE2d 83\\n) (1977) (stating\\n\\nthat OCGA § 41-2-5’s materially similar predecessor “provides that\\n\\nthe police court of such city shall have jurisdiction to . . . order [a\\n\\nnuisance’s] abatement”); Yield, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, \\n239 Ga. 578\\n,\\n\\n579 (\\n238 SE2d 351\\n) (1977) (“Appellee . . . proceeded under [OCGA §\\n\\n41-2-5’s materially similar predecessor] which authorizes a\\n\\nmunicipal court to determine the existence of and abate nuisances”\\n\\n(emphasis added)).\\n\\n      The question then is whether the municipal court, in ordering\\n\\nthe relief it did, acted within its authority under OCGA § 41-2-5 to\\n\\norder a nuisance be abated. 1 Wolcott answers this question. See 240\\n\\n\\n      1 The other question, which the parties do not raise before us and I do\\n\\nnot answer, is whether OCGA § 41-2-5 violates Article VI, Section I, Paragraph\\nIV (“Par. IV”) of the 1983 Georgia Constitution, which provides that “only the\\nsuperior and appellate courts and state-wide business court shall have the\\npower to issue process in the nature of . . . injunction.” This constitutional\\nquestion hinges on whether a nuisance-abatement order is inherently an\\ninjunction. In raising this issue, I note that Paragraph I of Art. VI, Sec. I of the\\n1983 Georgia Constitution, which provides that “[m]unicipal courts shall have\\njurisdiction over ordinance violations and such other jurisdiction as provided\\nby law,” may also bear on whether OCGA § 41-2-5 is constitutional.\\n                                         4\\n Ga. at 244-45. In Wolcott, property owners alleged that they were\\n\\nharmed by the continued use of an adjacent recreational park\\n\\nmaintained by the City of Atlanta and filed an action in superior\\n\\ncourt seeking nuisance abatement. See id. at 244. The superior court\\n\\nordered the City to “submit a plan for abatement” of a nuisance, and\\n\\nthe City appealed, arguing that under \\nGa. Code Ann. § 72-401\\n (a\\n\\nmaterially similar predecessor to OCGA § 41-2-5), the superior court\\n\\nlacked original jurisdiction over a nuisance abatement action\\n\\nbecause a city “police court” was the proper forum under § 72-401.\\n\\nSee id. We disagreed, reasoning that § 72-401 did not provide “a\\n\\ncomplete and adequate remedy at law,” because the nuisance\\n\\ncomplained of “did not result from the existence of a nuisance per se\\n\\nbut from the continuing overuse of the park by members of the\\n\\npublic, absent controls.” Id. at 244-45. The relief ordered was that\\n\\nthe City “develop a plan to control the public use of the park,” rather\\n\\nthan “the removal of the recreational facilities as is contemplated by\\n\\n[ ] § 72-401.” Id. at 245. Because the relief ordered “would have been\\n\\nbeyond the power of the municipal court of Atlanta,” “jurisdiction\\n\\n                                  5\\n was properly maintained in the Superior Court.” Id. at 244-45\\n\\n(referencing Ga. Const. of 1976, Art. VI, Sec. IV, Par. I (“The\\n\\nSuperior Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction in . . . equity\\n\\ncases.”)).\\n\\n     Wolcott supports that the relief granted in this case is also\\n\\n“beyond the power of the municipal court.” \\n240 Ga. at 245\\n. Here, the\\n\\nCity of Atlanta originally filed a complaint in rem to abate an alleged\\n\\npublic nuisance on the owner’s property, requesting the municipal\\n\\ncourt to ‘“close and immediately secure the Property so that it cannot\\n\\nbe used in connection with the commission of illegal activity.’” 400\\n\\nEdgewood, LLC, 369 Ga. App. at 673. But while the municipal court\\n\\nfound “the operation of the business at the Property” to be a\\n\\nnuisance, it did not find that the “Property itself created a public\\n\\nnuisance.” Id. at 673-74 (emphasis omitted). At this point then, the\\n\\nmunicipal court should have denied the City’s in rem abatement\\n\\naction. Instead, the court ordered the property owner “to install\\n\\nadditional security cameras, hire ‘competent security,’ and reduce\\n\\nthe hours of operation of the gas station and convenience store for\\n\\n                                  6\\n one year.” Id. at 674. Ordering these changes to how the owner\\n\\ncontrolled and operated its business on the property—rather than\\n\\nordering the property itself be closed—was injunctive relief beyond\\n\\nthe municipal court’s authority under OCGA § 41-2-5 to order a\\n\\nnuisance abated. See Wolcott, \\n240 Ga. at 244\\n (while ordering the\\n\\nremoval of a park’s recreational facilities was relief “contemplated”\\n\\nby OCGA § 41-2-5’s predecessor, ordering the City to “develop a plan\\n\\nto control the public use of the park” was equitable relief beyond\\n\\nmunicipal court’s jurisdiction (emphasis added)).\\n\\n      For these reasons, I agree that the Court of Appeals reached\\n\\nthe right result, but caution that the Court of Appeals’s opinion\\n\\nshould not be read as prohibiting a municipal court from abating a\\n\\nnuisance altogether, given a municipal court’s explicit authority to\\n\\ndo so under OCGA § 41-2-5. 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2 A party seeking to abate a nuisance may consider filing such an action\\n\\nin a superior court that has the jurisdiction to impose injunctive relief, should\\nthe nuisance-abatement action be denied.\\n                                       7\\n \"),\n",

TARVER v. STATE.\\n\\n\\n       MCMILLIAN, Justice.\\n\\n       Ricquavious Tarver was convicted of murder and other crimes\\n\\nin connection with the shooting death of Roosevelt Demmons.1\\n\\nTarver argues on appeal that (1) the trial court erred in excluding\\n\\nevidence of Tarver’s knowledge of Demmons’s previous acts of\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 Demmons was killed on August 27, 2016, and Tarver was charged by\\n\\nspecial presentment in McDuffie County in June 2017 for malice murder\\n(Count 1), felony murder predicated upon aggravated assault (Count 2),\\naggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Count 3), and possession of a\\nfirearm during the commission of a felony (Count 4). He was tried before a jury\\nin September 2018 and found guilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced\\nTarver to serve life in prison with the possibility of parole on Count 1, and five\\nyears in prison to be served consecutively on Count 4. Count 2 was vacated by\\noperation of law and Count 3 was merged into Count 1. Tarver filed a timely\\nmotion for new trial on October 2, 2018, which was amended by new counsel\\non July 31, 2019, and amended a second time by current counsel on March 24,\\n2021. Following a hearing on June 28, 2021, the trial court denied the motion\\nas amended on November 27, 2023. Tarver filed a timely notice of appeal, and\\nthe case was docketed to the April 2024 term of this Court. The Court heard\\noral argument on the case on April 18, 2024.\\n violence to support his claim of self-defense and (2) the trial court\\n\\nerred in excluding, on the grounds of hearsay, the video-recorded\\n\\ninterview of Tarver by police because the interview was not being\\n\\nadmitted for the truth of the matter asserted and should have been\\n\\nadmitted to show how cooperative Tarver was after the shooting. For\\n\\nthe reasons set forth below, we affirm.\\n\\n      1. The evidence presented at trial showed 2 that Alton Tucker\\n\\nowned a car wash business in Thomson in a former garage, and on\\n\\nAugust 27, 2016, Tarver went there to wash his car. Tucker had\\n\\nknown Tarver and Tarver’s father, a police officer, for a long time\\n\\nand considered them to be like family. Tucker’s 13-year-old son,\\n\\nShamar, was also at the car wash that day. Shamar and Tarver left\\n\\nthe car wash together to go to a store and then to Tarver’s parents’\\n\\nhouse. After they left, Demmons came to the car wash to collect\\n\\nmoney from Tucker for a set of tire rims Demmons was selling.\\n\\n\\n      2 Because this case involves an analysis of whether errors in excluding\\n\\nevidence were harmless, “we review the record de novo and weigh the evidence\\nas we would expect reasonable jurors to have done instead of viewing it in the\\nlight most favorable to the jury’s verdict.” Jivens v. State, \\n317 Ga. 859\\n, 863 (2)\\n(\\n896 SE2d 516\\n) (2023).\\n                                        2\\n Tucker asked Demmons to wait because he was in the process of\\n\\nwashing a car for a customer, Cedric Williams. Williams knew\\n\\nDemmons and asked if he wanted to walk to a nearby gas station to\\n\\nget something to drink while they were waiting, and Demmons\\n\\nagreed.\\n\\n     At some point, Tarver drove back by the car wash and saw\\n\\nDemmons’s truck parked there. He then called Tucker and told him\\n\\nthat Demmons was the man he “got into it with a few months back”\\n\\nand asked if he could come to the car wash to talk to Demmons “to\\n\\nget this over with.” At trial, Tarver, who testified in his own defense,\\n\\nexplained that a few months earlier, in May or early June 2016,\\n\\nTarver and Demmons had a confrontation at an apartment complex\\n\\nas they both sat in their vehicles with their windows open. Demmons\\n\\nyelled, so that everyone around could hear, that Tarver was “a\\n\\npolice[, a n****r] and you just like your daddy.” Demmons accused\\n\\nTarver of calling the police and getting Demmons “locked up” in\\n\\nconnection with a prior incident. When Tarver told Demmons that\\n\\nhe had no idea what Demmons was talking about, Demmons replied,\\n\\n                                   3\\n “I tell you what, just don’t speak my name no more, just don’t talk\\n\\nmy name no more, the next time you speak my name I’m coming to\\n\\nsee about you.” Tarver testified that he had never had trouble with\\n\\nDemmons before, and he had no further contact with Demmons\\n\\nbetween that incident and August 27. However, based on\\n\\nDemmons’s statement, Tarver thought that Demmons wanted “to\\n\\ntry to beat [him] up,” “to hurt [him],” or to “cause [him] harm.”\\n\\n     Tarver further testified that he applied for a permit to carry a\\n\\nweapon on July 7, 2016, which he received on July 25, and that he\\n\\npurchased a “.45 1911A Rock Island firearm” at some point between\\n\\nhis receipt of the permit and August 27. However, Tarver said that\\n\\nthere was nothing about the words Demmons used in the prior\\n\\nincident that made him feel threatened enough to get his gun\\n\\npermit; rather, he obtained the gun for his own protection and not\\n\\nbecause of Demmons.\\n\\n     When Tarver arrived back at the car wash with Shamar on\\n\\nAugust 27, Demmons and Williams had not yet returned from the\\n\\ngas station. Tucker asked Tarver if everything was going to be all\\n\\n                                  4\\n right with Demmons, and Tarver responded, “yeah, I’m good.”\\n\\nTucker asked this question because Tarver had shown Tucker his\\n\\ngun permit earlier in the day, and Tucker sought assurance from\\n\\nTarver that he was not carrying a weapon and was just intending to\\n\\ntalk to Demmons. Tarver testified at trial that he only wanted “to\\n\\nmake peace” with Demmons. However, he admitted that every time\\n\\nhe went anywhere, he “always tote[d]” his gun on his side, and, even\\n\\nthough Tarver usually carried his gun and ammunition separately,\\n\\nthat day, he put the ammunition clip in his gun when he got to the\\n\\ncar wash because he “knew [Demmons] was already there.”\\n\\n     Williams testified that as soon as he and Demmons got back to\\n\\nthe car wash from the gas station, Tarver came up to Demmons, and\\n\\nwhen Tarver got close enough, “they went to arguing.” Tucker\\n\\ntestified that he was washing Williams’s car when Williams and\\n\\nDemmons returned, and he did not pay much attention to what\\n\\nTarver and Demmons were saying. Both men were standing in one\\n\\nof the two open garage bay doors within ten feet from where Tucker\\n\\nwas working, and Tucker overheard Demmons tell Tarver “to find\\n\\n                                 5\\n somebody to play with or I’ll give you something you don’t want.”\\n\\nTucker told police at the time of the incident that he also heard\\n\\nDemmons tell Tarver, “Oh, I think I’m going to lay you out” and\\n\\nsomething to the effect of “get out of my face.” Williams testified that\\n\\nhe was sitting in the other garage bay, about 15 feet away from\\n\\nTarver and Demmons. He heard Demmons say, “I know what you\\n\\ndid” and “don’t make me whoop your a** out here with these shower\\n\\nshoes on,” after which Demmons turned and walked away.\\n\\n     Both Williams and Tucker testified that Demmons was\\n\\nwalking toward the back of the garage, and away from Tarver, when\\n\\nthey heard the first gunshot. They then observed Tarver walk\\n\\ntoward Demmons, who fell to the ground. After Demmons fell,\\n\\nTarver, as he later admitted, pointed the gun down at him and kept\\n\\nshooting until he had emptied his clip of eight .45 caliber bullets.\\n\\nDemmons was unarmed, and the only gun Williams or Tucker saw\\n\\nthat day was Tarver’s. No evidence was presented that any physical\\n\\ninteraction occurred between Tarver and Demmons before the\\n\\nshooting began, and Tarver admitted that Demmons never punched,\\n\\n                                   6\\n pushed, or even touched him.\\n\\n       After the shooting, Tucker and Tarver walked out of the\\n\\ngarage, and Tarver put his arm around Tucker, saying that it was\\n\\nnot Tucker’s fault, that it was “something [Tarver] wanted to do.”\\n\\n«V3-80» Tucker testified that he called the police and that Tarver\\n\\ncalled his mother and told her, “Mama, I just killed me a MF.”\\n\\nTarver stayed at the scene and put his gun in the glove box of his\\n\\ncar.\\n\\n       When police and EMS arrived, Demmons, who was lying face\\n\\ndown on the garage floor, was not breathing and had no pulse.\\n\\nTarver had his hands in the air and kept them there until officers\\n\\nordered him to the ground and handcuffed him. Tarver was\\n\\ncooperative with police, following their instructions and telling them\\n\\nthat the gun he used to shoot Demmons could be found in his car.\\n\\nPolice patted Tarver down and the officer who escorted Tarver to a\\n\\nwaiting police car testified that Tarver repeatedly volunteered that\\n\\nhe knew he was wrong for what he had done, and he should have\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  7\\n walked away. 3 The officer said that Tarver also voluntarily spoke to\\n\\npolice at the police station, saying that Demmons had tried to fight\\n\\nhim before and that Demmons was again trying to fight him that\\n\\nday, so Tarver “did what he had to do,” but he knew it was a mistake.\\n\\n      During the autopsy, the medical examiner identified ten\\n\\ngunshot wounds on Tucker’s body, some of which were caused by the\\n\\nsame bullet. Only one of the wounds was found on the front of\\n\\nDemmons’s body. The medical examiner described this wound as a\\n\\n“complex wound,” which she testified consisted of “an entrance, an\\n\\nexit, a reentrance, and a re-exit,” meaning that “the bullet went in,\\n\\nout, in, out.” The cause of death was attributed to multiple gunshot\\n\\nwounds.\\n\\n      A GBI crime scene specialist testified that he found flattened\\n\\nbullets at the scene and in Demmons’s clothing, suggesting that they\\n\\nhad passed through Demmons’s body and struck the concrete floor,\\n\\n\\n      3 Tarver testified that he told the officer. “I know I was wrong, but I have\\n\\nthe right to defend myself. And I said: it wasn’t supposed to happen like that,\\nI was just trying to talk to him.” He also testified that, at the jail, he just kept\\nrepeating, “I wish it would’ve never happened like that, I wish it would’ve\\nnever happened like that.”\\n                                         8\\n which supported that Demmons had been lying down when those\\n\\nshots were fired. He also found two bullets in the parking lot and the\\n\\nrest inside the garage.\\n\\n     In addition, Tarver testified that although Demmons never\\n\\nphysically touched him, Demmons “got very aggressive” when they\\n\\ntalked that day at the car wash. Demmons called Tarver “a rat” and\\n\\nasked why Tarver was there after he had “already snitched on\\n\\n[Demmons] one time.” When Tarver denied these accusations,\\n\\nDemmons asked Tarver, “what you coming up here for, to try me or\\n\\nsomething, you know I’m chain gang bound.” Tarver said he took\\n\\nthat statement to mean that Demmons had intentions of hurting\\n\\nTarver and that because Demmons had already been to prison, he\\n\\ndid not care what the consequences would be if he were to hurt\\n\\nTarver. Demmons also told Tarver that he did not need a pistol to\\n\\nfight him; Demmons said he “could beat [Tarver] with these slippers\\n\\non.” Tarver testified that he believed that Demmons knew Tarver\\n\\nwas “at a disadvantage” because Tarver was disabled from a work\\n\\naccident, which had severely injured his left knee so that he could\\n\\n                                  9\\n not bend it and reduced the strength in both of his legs.\\n\\n      According to Tarver,       after making these         statements,\\n\\nDemmons balled up his fists and turned sideways into a “fight\\n\\nstance,” asking Tarver if he was “ready.” Tarver said that Demmons\\n\\nwas walking toward him, so Tarver pulled out his gun to stop\\n\\nDemmons. Tarver testified that when he did that, Demmons said,\\n\\n“you got to use it,” which Tarver interpreted to mean that if he did\\n\\nnot use the gun, Demmons would get the gun from Tarver and use\\n\\nit on him. Demmons outweighed Tarver by almost 100 pounds\\n\\nalthough they were about the same height, and Tarver testified that\\n\\nwhen Demmons turned sideways and “came at [him],” Tarver felt\\n\\nthreatened and was “fighting for [his] life.” He then took two steps\\n\\nback and shot Demmons. Tarver said he shot Demmons eight times\\n\\nbecause he was taught in a firearm defense course not to quit\\n\\nshooting until he knew the person he was shooting was down. Tarver\\n\\nfurther testified that after the shooting, he called his mother to tell\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  10\\n her he had shot someone and also called 911.4\\n\\n        However, Tarver admitted on cross-examination that after he\\n\\nconfronted Demmons at the car wash, Demmons said he did not\\n\\nwant to talk about the prior incident, and it was Tarver who insisted\\n\\non carrying the conversation further. And when Tarver persisted,\\n\\nDemmons told Tarver to “get out of [his] face.”\\n\\n        2. Tarver first asserts that because self-defense was an issue in\\n\\nthe case and the jury was instructed on self-defense, the trial court\\n\\nerred in excluding evidence that Tarver knew Demmons had shot a\\n\\nman over a woman, had shot at a motel, and was known to carry a\\n\\ngun. Tarver sought to introduce this evidence to show Tarver’s state\\n\\nof mind at the time of the shooting and why he was in fear for his\\n\\nlife.\\n\\n        “A trial court’s decision whether to admit or exclude evidence\\n\\nis reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion.” State v. Brinkley,\\n\\n316 Ga. 689\\n, 690 (\\n889 SE2d 787\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation\\n\\n\\n        4 One of Tarver’s friends testified that Tarver called him right after the\\n\\nshooting, and the friend then called 911 to report the shooting. Seven character\\nwitnesses also testified on Tarver’s behalf, including his mother.\\n                                        11\\n omitted). But if the trial court abuses its discretion in excluding\\n\\nevidence, we will reverse a conviction for a trial court’s evidentiary\\n\\nerror only if it was harmful. See Morrell v. State, \\n313 Ga. 247\\n, 261\\n\\n(2) (c) (\\n869 SE2d 447\\n) (2022) (“It is fundamental that harm as well\\n\\nas error must be shown for reversal.”); OCGA § 24-1-103 (a) (“Error\\n\\nshall not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes\\n\\nevidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected.”). It is\\n\\nwell-settled that the test “for determining nonconstitutional\\n\\nharmless error is whether it is highly probable that the error did not\\n\\ncontribute to the verdict.” Jivens v. State, \\n317 Ga. 859\\n, 863 (2) (\\n896\\n\\nSE2d 516\\n) (2023) (citation and punctuation omitted). See also Truett\\n\\nv. State, \\n311 Ga. 313\\n, 318 (2) (\\n857 SE2d 690\\n) (2021).\\n\\n     Before trial, the State filed a motion to prohibit the defense\\n\\nfrom referring to Demmons’s “reputation . . . for violence and/or\\n\\nspecific acts of violence by [him],” and the trial court held a hearing\\n\\non the motion on the first day of trial. At the hearing, the State\\n\\nargued that any character evidence regarding Demmons in the form\\n\\nof specific bad acts equated to propensity evidence under OCGA §§\\n\\n                                  12\\n 24-4-404 and 24-4-4055 and that to admit the evidence Tarver\\n\\nwould be required to make a prima facie showing that he acted in\\n\\nself-defense by shooting Demmons, citing Oliver v. State, \\n329 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 377\\n, 381 (\\n765 SE2d 706\\n) (2014) (holding as “well established\\n\\nunder Georgia law,” and still in effect under the current Evidence\\n\\nCode, that before evidence of a victim’s general reputation for\\n\\nviolence or his specific acts of violence can be admitted, “the\\n\\ndefendant must, among other procedural and substantive burdens,\\n\\nmake a prima facie showing that the victim was the aggressor, that\\n\\nthe victim assaulted the defendant, and that the defendant\\n\\n\\n\\n     5 OCGA § 24-4-404 (b) provides:\\n\\n     Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts shall not be admissible\\n     to prove the character of a person in order to show action in\\n     conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other\\n     purposes, including, but not limited to, proof of motive,\\n     opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\\n     absence of mistake or accident.\\n     OCGA § 24-4-405 provides in relevant part:\\n     (a)    In all proceedings in which evidence of character or a trait of\\n     character of a person is admissible, proof shall be made by\\n     testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an\\n     opinion.\\n     (b)    In proceedings in which character or a trait of character of a person\\n     is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense or when an accused\\n     testifies to his or her own character, proof may also be made of specific\\n     instances of that person’s conduct . . . .\\n                                       13\\n responded with force only to defend himself or herself”) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). 6 In response, Tarver’s counsel indicated that\\n\\nhe did not intend to present any evidence of specific offenses. Rather,\\n\\nhe planned to present evidence as “to what my client knew, what my\\n\\nclient knew of this person, and prior difficulties they had had\\n\\ntogether.” After some further discussion, the trial court noted the\\n\\nparties’ agreement to the admission of prior difficulties between\\n\\nTarver and Demmons and granted the State’s motion in limine as to\\n\\nevidence of Demmons’s prior acts of violence involving third parties.\\n\\nHowever, during trial, Tarver’s counsel argued that the State had\\n\\nopened the door to testimony about Demmons’s bad acts by eliciting\\n\\nfrom Tarver on cross-examination that Demmons had called Tarver\\n\\na “snitch,” which counsel argued should permit Tarver to testify\\n\\nabout the conduct about which Demmons thought Tarver had\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     6  Some members of the Court are doubtful that this prima facie\\nrequirement was carried over to the current Evidence Code. However, we need\\nnot address this issue given that we assume error on this ground and conclude\\nthat any error was harmless.\\n                                     14\\n snitched.7 After reviewing the record, the trial court found that the\\n\\nState had not “opened the door” to more specific evidence and denied\\n\\nthe objection.\\n\\n     In his motion for new trial, Tarver contested the trial court’s\\n\\ndecision to exclude evidence of his knowledge of Demmons’s prior\\n\\nviolent acts toward third parties. At the motion for new trial\\n\\nhearing, Tarver testified that on the day of the shooting, he was\\n\\naware that Demmons “had just shot a motel up” and he “just shot a\\n\\nguy over a lady,” without further detail. Tarver said that those were\\n\\nrecent events at the time of the shooting, and his awareness of these\\n\\nevents influenced his actions. Tarver said it made him “feel like, you\\n\\nknow, that he would have shot me, too, because he was known for\\n\\ntoting a gun.” The trial court denied Tarver’s motion on this ground,\\n\\nfinding that the minimal probative value of the evidence was\\n\\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\\n\\nissues, and misleading the jury under OCGA § 24-4-403.\\n\\n\\n\\n     7 The record is unclear as to the particular acts as to which Tarver\\ncontended the State opened the door.\\n                                   15\\n      Even assuming, without deciding, that the trial court erred in\\n\\nexcluding this evidence at trial and that Tarver preserved this error\\n\\nfor ordinary appellate review, any such error was harmless. Tarver’s\\n\\ncounsel was allowed to elicit extensive evidence as to why Tarver\\n\\nfelt threatened by Demmons on the day of the shooting. Tarver\\n\\ntestified that in the incident several months prior to the shooting,\\n\\nDemmons accused Tarver of telling the police something that got\\n\\nDemmons “locked up” for a “prior situation.” Tarver said that from\\n\\nthe language Demmons used in making those accusations, he\\n\\nbelieved that Demmons wanted to hurt him. Tarver further testified\\n\\nthat on the day of the shooting, Demmons asked Tarver why he\\n\\nwanted to challenge him when Tarver knew that Demmons was\\n\\n“chain gang bound.” Tarver testified that he believed this statement\\n\\nmeant that Demmons wanted to hurt him and that Demmons did\\n\\nnot care about the consequences because he had already been to\\n\\nprison. Additionally, Demmons had a 100-pound weight advantage\\n\\nover Tarver, and Tarver said he believed that Demmons knew that\\n\\nTarver’s injuries put him at a disadvantage after Demmons said\\n\\n                                 16\\n that he did not need a gun to beat Tarver. Also, Tucker and Williams\\n\\neach testified to hearing Demmons threatening Tarver just before\\n\\nthe shooting. Therefore, evidence that Tarver was aware that\\n\\nDemmons had shot another man over a woman, “shot a motel up,”\\n\\nand was known to carry a gun added little to Tarver’s testimony\\n\\nabout his prior difficulties with Demmons and evidence of\\n\\nDemmons’s threats on the day of the shooting. See Cook v. State, \\n312\\n\\nGa. 299\\n, 302 (2) (\\n862 SE2d 510\\n) (2021) (any error in exclusion of\\n\\nthree instances of violence by victim against third parties to show\\n\\nthat defendant had reason to fear victim was harmless in light of\\n\\nother evidence at trial, including evidence showing victim’s prior\\n\\nthreats and violence toward defendant); Byers v. State, \\n311 Ga. 259\\n,\\n\\n263 (1) (\\n857 SE2d 447\\n) (2021) (concluding that exclusion of\\n\\ntestimony was harmless where it was essentially cumulative of\\n\\nother evidence); Nix v. State, \\n280 Ga. 141\\n, 144-45 (5) (\\n625 SE2d 746\\n)\\n\\n(2006) (the trial court’s error, if any, in excluding hearsay testimony\\n\\nof defendant’s mother, was harmless where the excluded testimony\\n\\nwas largely cumulative of other evidence introduced at trial).\\n\\n                                  17\\n      Moreover, Tarver’s claim of self-defense was weak since it\\n\\ndepended solely on Tarver’s self-serving testimony that Demmons\\n\\ncame at him. In contrast, there was strong evidence undercutting\\n\\nhis defense. After Tarver and Demmons had their initial verbal\\n\\naltercation earlier in the summer, Demmons did not further\\n\\nconfront Tarver or take any threatening action against him. In fact,\\n\\nthe two had no further contact until Tarver confronted Demmons on\\n\\nAugust 27, armed with a loaded weapon. Tarver testified that he\\n\\nloaded his gun at the car wash, though he usually kept his gun\\n\\nunloaded, because he knew Demmons was there. Moreover, Tarver\\n\\nacknowledged that when he confronted Demmons about the earlier\\n\\nincident, Demmons did not want to discuss the matter, but Tarver\\n\\npersisted, leading Demmons to tell him to “get out of [his] face.”\\n\\nTarver also admitted that Demmons never punched, pushed, or even\\n\\ntouched him that day. And two eyewitnesses testified that Demmons\\n\\nwas walking away from Tarver at the time Tarver shot him. This\\n\\ntestimony was supported by evidence that Demmons was found face\\n\\ndown after the shooting with ten gunshot wounds and had only one\\n\\n                                18\\n wound to the front of his body, which expert testimony explained\\n\\nwas a “complex wound” where the bullet could have gone in and out\\n\\nof the body. Additionally, Tarver continued shooting after Demmons\\n\\nwas on the ground and no longer posed a threat.\\n\\n     Because the excluded evidence was largely cumulative and the\\n\\nevidence supporting a claim of self-defense was weak, we conclude\\n\\nthat it is highly probable that the exclusion of the proffered evidence\\n\\ndid not contribute to the verdict, and any error was harmless. See\\n\\nHenderson v. State, \\n310 Ga. 708\\n, 714 (3) (\\n854 SE2d 523\\n) (2021) (trial\\n\\ncourt’s exclusion of defendant’s testimony about a victim's threat\\n\\nwas harmless, in part because that testimony “added little if\\n\\nanything” to defendant’s other testimony about “more explicit\\n\\nthreats” from the victim and because “evidence of [defendant’]s guilt\\n\\nwas very strong”); Beck v. State, \\n310 Ga. 491\\n, 497-99 (3) (\\n852 SE2d\\n\\n535\\n) (2020) (concluding that it was highly probable that any error\\n\\nby the trial court in ruling that the defense could not introduce\\n\\nvictim’s prior acts of violence (except any involving the defendant)\\n\\ndid not contribute to the verdict and was therefore harmless in light\\n\\n                                  19\\n of other evidence at trial); Rowland v. State, \\n306 Ga. 59\\n, 67 (4) (\\n829\\n\\nSE2d 81\\n) (2019) (given strong evidence of defendant’s guilt and the\\n\\nmarginal and cumulative value of the excluded evidence, it was\\n\\nhighly probable that any error in its exclusion did not contribute to\\n\\nthe verdict).\\n\\n     3. Tarver also asserts that the trial court abused its discretion\\n\\nin not allowing him to play his video-recorded interview with police\\n\\nbecause it was not hearsay as it was not being admitted for the truth\\n\\nof the matter asserted.8 Tarver asserts that he sought to admit the\\n\\nvideo “to show the jury his tone of voice, the degree of emotion\\n\\nshown, his forthrightness rather than deflections and evasions when\\n\\ntalking about the shooting.” As with the prior enumeration, we\\n\\nreview the trial court’s denial of Tarver’s request to play the video\\n\\nof his interview with police for an abuse of discretion, see Brinkley,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     8 To the extent that Tarver’s reply brief addresses the trial court’s ruling\\n\\nthat the video-recorded interview was not admissible as a prior consistent\\nstatement, we do not consider such an argument because it was raised for the\\nfirst time on appeal in a reply brief. See Supreme Court Rule 19 (3) (“Reply\\nbriefs may not be used to expand the enumeration of errors.”).\\n\\n                                      20\\n 316 Ga. at 690, and if we conclude that there is error, we then\\n\\nconsider whether any error was harmful under the standard for non-\\n\\nconstitutional errors. See Morrell, 313 Ga. at 261 (2) (c).\\n\\n     When Tarver announced his intention to testify, defense\\n\\ncounsel indicated that he planned to play Tarver’s recorded\\n\\ninterview with police. The State moved in limine to exclude the\\n\\nrecording on the grounds that it contained hearsay since it was being\\n\\noffered for the truth of the matters asserted, was not being offered\\n\\nby a party opponent, and would constitute improper bolstering. In\\n\\nresponse, Tarver’s counsel argued that it was not improper hearsay\\n\\nbecause he wanted the jury to see that Tarver was being cooperative\\n\\nin the wake of the shooting and had nothing to hide then or at trial.\\n\\nAfter the trial court took a recess to give the defense an opportunity\\n\\nto research the issue, Tarver’s counsel also asked that the recording\\n\\nbe admitted as a past recorded recollection, which is not excluded by\\n\\nthe hearsay rule even when the declarant is available as a witness.\\n\\nThe trial court denied Tarver’s request to admit the recording,\\n\\nfinding it clear “that it would be self-serving and hearsay even under\\n\\n                                  21\\n the new rules.” In its order denying the motion for new trial on this\\n\\nground, the trial court reaffirmed its conclusion that the statements\\n\\nwere self-serving hearsay.\\n\\n     Even assuming, without deciding, that the trial court abused\\n\\nits discretion in excluding the video-recorded interview for the\\n\\npurpose for which it was offered, any such error was harmless in\\n\\nlight of the other evidence presented at trial that showed that\\n\\nTarver was cooperative with police after the shooting. One police\\n\\nofficer described Tarver as “cooperative as can be” and said that he\\n\\ntold the officers where to locate his gun; another officer described\\n\\nTarver as “very cooperative”; and a third police officer testified that\\n\\nTarver told police where to find the gun, spoke with police willingly,\\n\\nvolunteered to give up his clothes for a search without a warrant,\\n\\nand was “cooperative.” Tucker also testified that Tarver did not try\\n\\nto run, but instead directed Tucker to call 911, called 911 himself,\\n\\nput the gun in his car, and waited for police. And Tarver also\\n\\ntestified to the actions he took to cooperate with police. We conclude\\n\\nthat evidence of Tarver’s cooperation from the video-recorded police\\n\\n                                  22\\n interview would be largely cumulative of the other evidence\\n\\npresented at trial describing Tarver’s interactions and cooperation\\n\\nwith police, and therefore it is highly probable that the exclusion of\\n\\nthe video did not contribute to the verdict. Accordingly, any error by\\n\\nthe trial court was harmless.9 See Byers, 311 Ga. at 263 (1); Nix,\\n\\n280 Ga. at 144-45\\n (5).\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      9 Tarver also enumerates as error that, to the extent that either of his\\n\\nfirst two enumerations of error was not properly preserved for appeal, he\\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to properly preserve the\\nclaim. Defense counsel acknowledged at oral argument that this was a\\n“backup” claim in the event either of the other two issues were not preserved\\nand that it appeared from the briefing that the parties agreed the issues were\\npreserved. Because we have assumed that the first claim was preserved for\\nordinary appellate review and because the second claim was clearly preserved,\\nwe conclude that no claim for ineffective assistance of counsel on this ground\\ncan stand. Therefore, we need not address Tarver’s third enumeration.\\n       In addition, Tarver does not argue that the errors we have assumed and\\ndetermined to be individually harmless nevertheless cumulatively resulted in\\nharm. However, from our review of the record we discern no cumulative\\nprejudice warranting reversal. See State v. Lane, \\n308 Ga. 10\\n, 17 (1) (\\n838 SE2d\\n808\\n) (2020) (“[E]ven in the evidentiary context, a defendant who wishes to take\\nadvantage of the [cumulative error rule] should explain to the reviewing court\\njust how he was prejudiced by the cumulative effect of multiple errors.”).\\n                                      23\\n \"),\n",

TERRY v. THE STATE.\\n\\n       PIPKIN, Judge.\\n\\n       Appellant Joseph Daniel Terry appeals his conviction for the misdemeanor\\n\\noffense of obstruction of an officer. See OCGA § 16-10-24 (a). We agree with\\n\\nAppellant that the State failed to meet its burden of proof and, thus, that the trial court\\n\\nerroneously denied his motion for a directed verdict. Accordingly, we reverse the\\n\\njudgment of conviction.\\n\\n       1. The record before us shows that Appellant was indicted for the offense of\\n\\nfelony obstruction of an officer. See OCGA § 16-10-24 (b). The indictment alleged\\n\\nthat Appellant “knowingly and willfully oppos[ed] Billy Fuller, a law enforcement\\n\\nofficer . . . in the lawful discharge of his official duties by offering to do violence to said\\n\\nperson, by advancing in an aggressive manner towards said officer while holding a\\n baseball bat.” At Appellant’s April 2023 trial, the State presented the testimony of\\n\\nOfficer Fuller, as well as various video recordings from the night in question. When\\n\\nviewed in the appropriate light, see Coalson v. State, \\n237 Ga. App. 570\\n, 570 (\\n515 SE2d\\n\\n882\\n) (1999), the State’s evidence established as follows. In the early morning hours\\n\\nof August 4, 2019, Officer Fuller was parked in his patrol car in Rockmart, Georgia.\\n\\nAt approximately 2:15 a.m., an officer from another jurisdiction who was traveling\\n\\nthrough the area asked on the police radio whether officers were familiar with “a man\\n\\nand woman [who] walk[] around town carrying a baseball bat.” According to the radio\\n\\ncall, that officer observed a man with a baseball bat -- later identified as Appellant --\\n\\n“and a guy on a bike and a female” traveling on a sidewalk near a well-known business\\n\\ncalled “House of China.” While an officer can be heard remarking on the radio that\\n\\nthe man was “probably just playing a little night ball,” Officer Fuller and a second\\n\\nofficer responded to “check it out.”\\n\\n      Officer Fuller encountered the trio as he drove south on the road on which the\\n\\ntrio was traveling north. When Officer Fuller arrived in the area, “the only thing [he]\\n\\nsaw them doing was walking on the sidewalk,” though he also testified that it was\\n\\nunusual for someone to be walking through the area with a baseball bat at that time of\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n day. The officer explained that the trio remained on the sidewalk, that they were not\\n\\non private property or near any vehicles, and that the trio were neither bothering nor\\n\\nthreatening anyone. When the officers arrived at Appellant’s location, Officer Fuller\\n\\nand the second officer pulled their respective cars alongside the curb with their\\n\\npassenger doors toward the side walk. While both officers and their respective vehicles\\n\\nwere equipped with cameras, none of those cameras were turned on by the officers\\n\\nduring their initial encounter with Appellant. As to that encounter, Officer Fuller\\n\\ntestified as follows:\\n\\n              [Officer Fuller]: So I arrived on location just to basically an\\n       interview, so an investigatory -- an investigative detention as to what was\\n       going on.[1]\\n\\n                [Prosecutor]: All right.\\n\\n              [Officer Fuller]: I had just been called by [the reporting officer] in\\n       reference to [Appellant] being around the House of China, so they\\n       could’ve possibly broke into it. So I’m using it as an investigative\\n       detention. I pull up. As I pull up, I turn on my takedown lights, which is\\n       the two bright white lights that come on in front of the light bar on top\\n       of the car, and I flip on the cruise lights. The cruise lights are on the end,\\n       so they just light up blue. They’re not flashing. There’s no siren. Uh, I\\n       step out of the car. As I step out of the car, I tell [Appellant] to drop the\\n       bat.\\n              [Prosecutor]: At that point, how far away from him were you?\\n\\n\\n       1\\n           The area in which this incident occurred is, at least in part, residential.\\n                                              3\\n       [Officer Fuller]: Probably 15 yards from the front of my car.\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: Okay. So 15 yards --\\n\\n      [Officer Fuller]: 30 feet.\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: -- roughly, roughly 30 feet?\\n\\n      [Office Fuller]: (Nodded head in the affirmative). So I give him\\nthe command to drop the bat. He says fuck you and continues to walk\\ntoward me.\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: Now, did -- did you initiate the cursing or did he?\\n\\n      [Officer Fuller]: He did.\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: All right. Go ahead.\\n\\n      [Officer Fuller]: He continues walking towards me, says fuck you\\nto me, so I had pulled my duty weapon out of my holster and I’ve got it\\ndown by my side.\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: Now, why did you do that?\\n\\n      [Officer Fuller]: Well, the short distance as it is, he can close that\\ndistance and hit me with the bat prior to me being able to unholster. So --\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: Okay.\\n\\n       [Officer Fuller]: -- unholster and I’m holding it at my side. I don’t\\nthink he can even see it because there’s now a car in between us. He’s at\\nthe front end of my car by this point, and I’m moving to the back end of\\nmy car, again, giving him the verbal command to drop the bat. Fuck you.\\nHe makes it from there to the rear of my car. I again: drop the bat. No\\n\\n                                     4\\n cursing. Fuck you. At this point, he’s made it to the back of my car and\\nhe’s turned parallel with me. There’s no barrier in between us anymore.\\nAt this point, he can -- he can do some serious damage with that bat with\\nthe short distance that we are. I made the determination, I pointed my\\nduty weapon at him and gave him another verbal command to drop the\\nbat. At that time, he flipped the bat. He didn’t swing it at me. He didn’t\\noverhand throw it like a baseball. He flipped it at me.\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: All right. I want to go back up and go through this.\\nSo you said originally y’all were about 30 feet?\\n\\n      [Officer Fuller]: That’s, yeah, from the front of my car, so -- and\\nI’m on the other -- on the driver’s side of my car.\\n\\n        [Prosecutor]: Okay. And how is he carrying the bat?\\n\\n        [Officer Fuller]: Just at his side.\\n\\n        ....\\n\\n        [Prosecutor]: Okay. Now, let’s be clear. He never raised the bat?\\n\\n        [Officer Fuller]: He did not.\\n\\n        [Prosecutor]: But he flipped the bat towards you?\\n\\n        [Officer Fuller]: Yes.\\n\\n        [Prosecutor attempts to flip the wooden baseball bat but breaks it]\\n\\n        [Prosecutor]: Okay. Now, at that point, what’s going through your\\nmind?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        5\\n              [Officer Fuller]: I, at this point, I’ve already made the\\n      determination that he’s under arrest for obstruction. I gave him four\\n      chances to drop the bat. I’m in a marked police unit. I’m in uniform. I’m\\n      a -- that’s enough identification in my eyes to say the police gave you a\\n      lawful order. At that point, he’s -- and he’s made me raise my duty\\n      weapon at him. He was going to jail for obstruction.\\n\\nAfter flipping the bat, Appellant was instructed to put his hands behind his back, but\\n\\nhe failed to comply; according to Officer Fuller, Appellant took a “fighting stance”\\n\\nand was subsequently “tased.” It was during this portion of the altercation that the\\n\\nofficers’ cameras were engaged.2\\n\\n      Later during his direct testimony, Officer Fuller addressed the “legal duty” he\\n\\nwas performing at the time that he approached Appellant, stating as follows:\\n\\n      [Officer Fuller]: Um. All right. So it’s considered an ARS stop.\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: Explain that.\\n\\n\\n\\n      2\\n       One of the recordings captured Officer Fuller stating as follows after Appellant\\nwas “tased” and placed under arrest:\\n\\n      [The reporting officer] clicked over to our channel . . . as he was passing\\n      down through here. Sees this dude walking down the street carrying a\\n      bat. So, I pull up on him. He’s yelling and screaming as soon as I pull up.\\n      So, I give verbal commands for him to drop the bat. He starts walking\\n      towards the car, he’s like, “fuck you, duh duh duh.” So, I’m like\\n      [gestures pulling his firearm] “drop the bat.” After I point it at him, he\\n      decides to drop the bat.\\n                                          6\\n       [Officer Fuller]: Articulable reasonable suspicion, that there is a crime\\n      that’s possibly happened or its going to happen.\\n\\n      [Prosecutor]: Okay.\\n\\n      [Officer Fuller]: At that point [after learning] . . . that [Appellant had\\n      been seen] around the House of China, I don’t know if he’s broke into\\n      it. I’m going to stop him, talk to him. If I had been given the opportunity\\n      to send somebody down to the House of China to see if it had been\\n      broken into, while talking with Mr. Terry, if he had gave me the\\n      opportunity, why are you walking around at two o’clock in the morning\\n      with a baseball bat? Had he of given me a good reason: I’m afraid a dog’s\\n      going to attack us. Thank you, sir. Have a nice day. He never gave the\\n      opportunity to go from an ARS. He went from ARS to probable cause.\\n\\n      On cross-examination, Officer Fuller acknowledged that there had been no\\n\\nradio traffic indicating a break in at the House of China or any where else in the\\n\\nvicinity. In fact, the officer acknowledged that he was simply acting “with a hunch”\\n\\nand that his sole focus during the stop was on Appellant to the exclusion of the other\\n\\ntwo individuals. The individual on the bike rode away during the incident because he\\n\\nwas not asked to stop, and officers commanded the woman to leave the scene without\\n\\nany further investigation. Also during cross-examination, Officer Fuller clarified his\\n\\nearlier testimony concerning Appellant’s path of travel, explaining as follows:\\n\\n              [Defense counsel]: . . . . And so when you wrote in your report and\\n      said yesterday [that Appellant] continued walking toward my direction,\\n      is this what you mean, that they’re continuing to walk north?\\n\\n                                          7\\n              [Officer Fuller]: Yes.\\n\\n           [Defense counsel]: Okay. It gets a little -- it’s hard to describe in\\n      words, isn’t it? right\\n\\n             [Officer Fuller]: (Nodded heard in the affirmative)\\n\\n             [Defense counsel]: Most of the time when we think somebody is\\n      walking in our direction, we think they’re like walking directly face to\\n      face toward us.\\n\\n             [Officer Fuller]: Right\\n\\n            [Defense counsel]: So I want to clarify and make sure I\\n      understand. Okay? That’s not what you meant when you said that?\\n\\n             [Officer Fuller]: No ma’am. I meant they were walking in my\\n      direction with -- my car was in between us.\\n\\n             ....\\n\\n            [Defense Counsel]: So, they’re coming in your direction, but\\n      they’re not coming at you?\\n\\n             [Officer Fuller]: Right.\\n\\nOfficer Fuller also clarified on cross-examination that Appellant was holding the bat\\n\\nin a downward direction by his side and that the bat was swinging “down next to\\n\\n[Appellant’s] right leg” like “one would swing your arms when you walk.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          8\\n        2. We now turn to Appellant’s assertion that the State failed to meet its burden\\n\\nof proving the offense of obstruction of an officer. Under OCGA § 16-10-24 (b),\\n\\nfelony obstruction of an officer is committed whenever one “knowingly and willfully\\n\\nresists, obstructs, or opposes any law enforcement officer . . . in the lawful discharge\\n\\nof his or her official duties by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer.”\\n\\nThe misdemeanor offense is committed when “a person who knowingly and willfully\\n\\nobstructs or hinders any law enforcement officer . . . in the lawful discharge of his or\\n\\nher official duties.” OCGA § 16-10-24 (a). As the Georgia Supreme Court has\\n\\nexplained, “[b]y its express terms, OCGA § 16-10-24 applies only when the defendant\\n\\nobstructs or hinders a law enforcement officer ‘in the lawful discharge of his or her\\n\\nofficial duties.’” (Emphasis in original.) Glenn v. State, \\n310 Ga. 11\\n, 25 (1) (c) (\\n849 SE2d\\n\\n409\\n) (2020). Thus, under either the greater or lesser offense, “the State must prove\\n\\nthat the officer was in the lawful discharge of his official duties at the time of the\\n\\nobstruction.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Bacon v. State, \\n347 Ga. App. 689\\n,\\n\\n690 (\\n820 SE2d 503\\n) (2018). Indeed, “[i]t is well settled that detaining or arresting a\\n\\nperson without authority to do so under the law does not constitute the lawful\\n\\ndischarge of the duties of a law enforcement officer, and, therefore, one who resists\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            9\\n an unlawful arrest or detention does not commit the offense of obstruction.” Glenn,\\n\\n310 Ga. at 25 (1) (c).\\n\\n      To determine whether Appellant obstructed Officer Fuller here, “we first must\\n\\ndetermine whether [Officer Fuller’s] actions were lawful during his interaction with\\n\\n[Appellant], as well as [Appellant’s] right to end the encounter.” Johnson v. State, \\n363\\n\\nGa. App. 12\\n, 16 (1) (\\n869 SE2d 177\\n) (2022). We consider this question by applying the\\n\\nframework created by Terry v. Ohio, \\n392 U. S. 1\\n (88 SCt 1868, 20 LE2d 889) (1968).\\n\\nSee Johnson, 363 Ga. at 16 (1). Under this framework,\\n\\n      there are at least three types of police-citizen encounters: verbal\\n      communications that involve no coercion or detention; brief stops or\\n      seizures that must be accompanied by a reasonable suspicion; and\\n      arrests, which can be supported only by probable cause.\\n\\n             In a “first-tier” encounter, officers may approach citizens, ask for\\n      identification, and freely question the citizen without any basis or belief\\n      that the citizen is involved in criminal activity, as long as the officers do\\n      not detain the citizen or create the impression that the citizen may not\\n      leave. So long as a reasonable person would feel free to disregard the\\n      police and go about his business, the encounter is consensual and no\\n      reasonable suspicion is required. Importantly, an officer may not use\\n      force to effectuate a first-tier encounter as an officer in such an\\n      encounter has no authority to detain or restrict the liberty of a citizen,\\n      and the citizen has the right to withdraw from the encounter or resist any\\n      such use of force with a proportionate use of force.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           10\\n              In a “second-tier” encounter, when an officer develops a\\n      reasonable, articulable suspicion that the citizen is committing or has\\n      committed a crime, the officer then has the authority to detain the citizen\\n      for an investigative stop, or what has come to be known as a “Terry\\n      stop.” In a second-tier encounter, the suspect’s physical resistance to his\\n      detention is unlawful. In a second-tier encounter, the officer may also\\n      take reasonable steps to protect his safety and the safety of others while\\n      detaining the individual.\\n\\n             In a “third-tier” encounter, when an officer has probable cause to\\n      believe that an individual is committing or has committed a crime, the\\n      officer is authorized to make an arrest and take the individual into\\n      custody. When an officer with probable cause seeks to arrest an\\n      individual, that person is not free to flee or resist the arrest, although he\\n      retains the right not to speak with the officer.\\n\\n(Citations, punctuation, and footnote omitted.) State v. Copeland, \\n310 Ga. 345\\n, 351-352\\n\\n(2) (b) (\\n850 SE2d 736\\n) (2020). Only the first-two tiers are relevant here, and we\\n\\naddress each in turn.\\n\\n      (a) To the extent that Officer Fuller’s encounter with Appellant was a first-tier\\n\\nencounter -- that, is, that Officer Fuller merely intended to question Appellant about\\n\\nhis presence in the area with a baseball bat -- Appellant would have been entitled to\\n\\nignore the officer’s questions, disregard his commands, and walk away; Appellant’s\\n\\nexercise of those rights does not amount to obstruction. See Ewumi v. State, \\n315 Ga.\\n\\nApp. 656\\n, 662-663, (1) (a) (\\n727 SE2d 257\\n) (2012) (defendant walking around an\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           11\\n apartment complex in a high-crime area around midnight not required to stop and\\n\\nspeak with officer who was in the area investigating a shooting that resulted in a bullet\\n\\nentering a residence; thus, defendant was not guilty of obstructing an officer by failing\\n\\nto answer the officer’s question or running away).3 Cf. Black v. State, \\n281 Ga. App. 40\\n,\\n\\n44 (1) (\\n635 SE2d 568\\n) (2006) (“[A] citizen’s ability to walk away or otherwise avoid\\n\\na police officer is the touchstone of a first-tier encounter. Even running from police\\n\\nduring a first-tier encounter is wholly permissible.” (Citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted.)).\\n\\n       Relying on nothing more than broad language discussing protective searches\\n\\nunder Terry, the State argues that Officer Fuller was entitled to immediately demand\\n\\nthat Appellant drop the bat as a matter of officer safety during this first-tier encounter.\\n\\nHowever, the Terry court explained that an officer is authorized to engage to pat down\\n\\na citizen for safety “to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the\\n\\nassault of the police officer.” (Emphasis supplied.) Terry, \\n392 U.S. 1\\n, 29 (IV). The\\n\\n\\n       3\\n         The State asserts that Ewumi is inapposite because, according to the State,\\n“[t]he case is based on the denial of a pretrial motion to suppress that the trial court\\ndenied. No such motion was brought in this case.” The State’s assessment of Ewumi\\nis incorrect; instead, the appeal follows the defendant’s convictions for, among other\\nthings, felony obstruction of an officer. Ewumi, \\n315 Ga. App. at 656\\n. Further, both\\ncases require the same application of the Terry framework.\\n                                            12\\n baseball bat here was certainly not hidden. Nevertheless, even if we were to accept the\\n\\nState’s implicit extension of Terry -- that is, that Officer Fuller was entitled to demand\\n\\nAppellant drop the baseball bat for officer safety during a supposed first-tier encounter\\n\\n-- the State’s argument is still unavailing under these circumstances. It is patent that\\n\\nAppellant did not wish to engage with police on the night in question, and the State\\n\\nhas offered no legal authority suggesting that a police officer may search for or secure\\n\\nweapons as part of what could only be described as a “non-consensual” first-tier\\n\\nencounter; indeed, such a legal position turns a first-tier encounter on its head.4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      4\\n         Further, whatever officer safety measures are permitted under Terry during a\\nfirst-tier encounter, those measures are authorized only where “a reasonably prudent\\nman in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of\\nothers was in danger.”Terry, \\n392 U. S. at 27\\n (III). The State fails to address this\\nrequirement, and we can find no evidence that would warrant a belief that anyone was\\nin danger. The undisputed evidence shows that, before parking his patrol vehicle, the\\nofficer observed nothing more than an individual walking down a sidewalk with two\\nother individuals while carrying a wooden baseball bat in a relaxed and non-\\nthreatening way. While it is unquestioned that Officer Fuller immediately unholstered\\nhis duty weapon and ultimately pointed it at Appellant, it is not the officer’s subjective\\nbeliefs that we use to evaluate danger; again, it is the “reasonably prudent” individual\\nstandard. Here, though Appellant may have used profanity, he did nothing more than\\ncontinue to walk on the sidewalk parallel to the officers’ vehicles while carrying the\\nbaseball bat by his side until he was forced to comply with the officer’s demand at\\ngunpoint.\\n\\n\\n                                            13\\n       To the extent that these facts establish a first-tier encounter, we conclude that\\n\\nOfficer Fuller was not entitled to command Appellant to drop his baseball bat and that\\n\\nAppellant’s temporary continued march down the sidewalk did not amount to the\\n\\nobstruction of a police officer.\\n\\n      (b) We now look to whether Officer Fuller’s actions were warranted as part of\\n\\na second-tier encounter, better known as a “Terry” stop. At trial, Officer Fuller\\n\\nhimself characterized his interaction with Appellant as second-tier encounter,\\n\\nexplaining that it was an “[a]rticulable reasonable suspicion” stop. However, as\\n\\nexplained above, this kind of investigative stop would have been warranted only if\\n\\nOfficer Fuller had developed a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Appellant was\\n\\ncommitting or was about to commit a crime. Here, Officer Fuller merely testified that\\n\\nit was unusual to see someone walking in the area with a baseball bat at that time of\\n\\nday, that he did not know if Appellant had “broken into” the House of China, and\\n\\nthat he had a “hunch” about Appellant.5 These circumstances are insufficient to\\n\\ncreate reasonable suspicion. See, e.g., Runnells v. State, \\n357 Ga. App. 572\\n, 576 (1) (851\\n\\n\\n\\n      5\\n       The State points to no evidence, and we have found none, suggesting that this\\nwas a high-crime area or that Appellant was in the vicinity of a location known for\\ncriminal activity.\\n                                           14\\nSE2d 196\\n) (2020) (recognizing the well-established principle that “[a] reasonable\\n\\nsuspicion is more than a subjective, unparticularized suspicion or hunch” (citation\\n\\nomitted)). Indeed, neither Officer Fuller nor the State has articulated any offense that\\n\\nAppellant was suspected of committing or had committed at the time Officer Fuller\\n\\narrived on the scene, and the mere fact that Appellant was cursing and agitated does\\n\\nnot amount to reasonable suspicion. See State v. Tollefson, \\n259 Ga. App. 320\\n, 322-323\\n\\n(1) (b) (\\n577 SE2d 21\\n) (2003) (in the absence of officers identifying a criminal offense\\n\\nthat the defendant had committed or was about to commit, defendant’s cursing and\\n\\nagitation did not create reasonable suspicion).\\n\\n      Finally, the State asserts that “once [Appellant] began to curse at the officer\\n\\nand continue to walk towards him while refusing to drop the bat and cussing loudly\\n\\nat [Officer] Fuller, [Appellant] committed the crimes of disorderly conduct and\\n\\nobstruction of an officer and was subject to arrest at that moment.” (Punctuation\\n\\nomitted.) However, as established above, Officer Fuller’s encounter remained a first-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           15\\n tier encounter,6 and this type of defensive behavior “would be consistent with\\n\\n[Appellant’s] right to decline any contact from the police at that point in the\\n\\nencounter.” State v. Copeland, 310 Ga. at 354 (2) (c) (ii) (defendant entitled to take a\\n\\n“defensive stance” in response to a first-tier encounter, and such conduct would not\\n\\n“provide a law enforcement officer with a reasonable articulable suspicion necessary\\n\\nto escalate the encounter to a Terry stop”).\\n\\n      For these reasons, the State’s evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction\\n\\nfor misdemeanor obstruction of a police officer, and the trial court erred when it\\n\\ndenied Appellant’s motion for a directed verdict. Accordingly, Appellant’s judgment\\n\\nof conviction is reversed.\\n\\n      Judgment reversed. Barnes, P. J., and Gobeil, J., concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      6\\n         Because the stop remained a first-tier encounter, the State’s reliance on\\nRichardson v. State, \\n239 Ga. App. 345\\n (\\n521 SE2d 239\\n) (1999), is misplaced. In that\\ncase, law enforcement had reasonable suspicion to detain the defendant and, further,\\nthe arresting officer articulated a reasonable basis to detain the defendant to conduct\\na search for weapons.

BAILEY et al. v. MAKE A DIFFERENCE MINISTRIES, INC.\\n\\n      PIPKIN, Judge.\\n\\n      Appellant Catherine Bailey brought a negligence action1 against Appellee Make\\n\\na Difference Ministries, Inc. d/b/a Camp Highland (“Camp Highland”) seeking\\n\\ndamages for injuries she received while attempting to evacuate Camp Highland’s\\n\\n“Teams Course” during a bout of intense rain.2 Camp Highland later filed a motion\\n\\nfor summary judgment, contending that Bailey’s claims were barred by a\\n\\nMedical/Liability Release Form (“Release”) Bailey signed before she attempted the\\n\\n\\n\\n      1\\n          Bailey’s husband Steven also asserted a claim for loss of consortium.\\n      2\\n        The Teams Course will also be referred to as the “Course.” As discussed\\nmore in this opinion, the Teams Course is a two-level elevated structure consisting of\\nvarious “challenge” elements that participants navigate with a partner.\\n Course; consequently, Bailey amended her complaint to assert claims for gross\\n\\nnegligence. Following a hearing, the trial court granted Camp Highland’s motion, and\\n\\nBailey filed this appeal. We now affirm in part and reverse in part.\\n\\n      Pertinent here, the record shows that in September 2018, Bailey was employed\\n\\nas a high school teacher at Shiloh Hills Christian School (“School”). The School had\\n\\nplanned an overnight trip to Camp Highland for its junior and high school students,\\n\\nand Bailey was acting as a chaperone for the high school students who were in their\\n\\nsenior year. The students and chaperones arrived at Camp Highland on Wednesday,\\n\\nSeptember 26, 2018, and spent the day participating in various activities. On the\\n\\nsecond day, the high school students were scheduled to navigate the top level of the\\n\\nCourse.3 However, after observing the top level of the Course, some students chose\\n\\nnot to participate, leaving an uneven number of students who wanted to attempt the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3\\n         Our facts are derived primarily from the parties’ depositions. In some\\ninstances, the depositions were video recorded and in almost all instances photographs\\nof the Course structure were used during the depositions to allow the deponents to\\npoint to different areas or explain their testimony in the context of the photographs.\\nWe, however, have been provided with only the transcribed versions of the\\ndepositions, which lack the context of the descriptions that were given while using\\nvisual aids. Although this has not impacted our analysis, it may have caused us to be\\nless than precise in our descriptions of the Course.\\n                                          2\\n Course. Bailey then volunteered to partner with one of the female students so the\\n\\nstudent could participate in the activity.\\n\\n      Prior to beginning the Course, the participants were instructed on how to use\\n\\nthe safety equipment, which consisted of a safety helmet and a harness attached to a\\n\\nrope or “lanyard” that the participants would clip to a metal safety line running\\n\\nthroughout the elements of the Course. The Course was designed so that participants\\n\\nhad to unclip and then reattach their lanyard as they moved from one element to the\\n\\nnext, and the partners had to work together to make sure their partner always\\n\\nremained tethered to the safety cable by at least one lanyard. The Course also had\\n\\ncargo nets on both ends, and these nets were used both as points of ingress and egress;\\n\\nparticipants could also exit the course via a zip line or be lowered or belayed down a\\n\\nrock climbing wall. Participants could navigate the Course in either direction, and the\\n\\nparticipants who were attempting only the top level, as was the situation with the\\n\\nSchool group, usually entered the Course via the shorter of the two cargo nets and\\n\\nthey usually exited the course via the zip line or were belayed down the rock climbing\\n\\nwall.4 Additionally, it was not unusual for participants who quit the Course before\\n\\n      4\\n         Participants who were attempting only the lower level would typically enter\\nat the long cargo net end and descend at the short cargo net end.\\n                                             3\\n completing it and camp personnel to use the short cargo net to exit the Course from\\n\\nthe top level. Participants were also instructed on how to lengthen or shorten their\\n\\nsafety ropes and whether they left it longer or later shortened it while traversing the\\n\\nvarious elements generally depended on their level of comfort – a longer length\\n\\nprovided more mobility and made it easier to work with their partner to navigate\\n\\ncertain elements while a shorter length provided a greater feeling of security.\\n\\nHowever, while the rope length was generally left to the discretion of the participants,\\n\\nparticipants were usually instructed to make their rope longer when they were\\n\\nascending the short cargo net at the beginning of the course.\\n\\n      Although the participants were instructed on how to handle the safety\\n\\nequipment, they were not provided with any instruction on how to complete the\\n\\nvarious Course elements because part of the “challenge” was for participants to work\\n\\nas a team to complete the elements under somewhat stressful circumstances – high up\\n\\nin the air, tethered only by ropes to a safety line. However, trained camp personnel,\\n\\nknown as facilitators, were stationed along the Course to oversee the participants. As\\n\\nset forth in the Camp Highland Operations Manual, participants were not allowed on\\n\\nthe Course without a facilitator, and facilitators were to provide constant supervision\\n\\n\\n                                           4\\n of the participants while they navigated the Course. To ensure that this happened,\\n\\nfacilitators were positioned along the Course so that every participant could be seen\\n\\nby at least one facilitator. More specifically, the job of the facilitators was to assist the\\n\\nparticipants in entering and exiting the Course, to ensure that the participants were\\n\\nfollowing safety protocols, and to assist any participant who might encounter difficulty\\n\\nas they navigated the Course. On the day Bailey was injured, four facilitators had been\\n\\nassigned to oversee the students– a “lead-in” facilitator who oversaw the participants\\n\\nas they entered the Course via the short cargo net, two “in-course” facilitators who\\n\\nwere stationed along the various elements, and one “lead” facilitator, who was\\n\\nstationed on the tower where the zip line was located.\\n\\n       Because Bailey and her partner were the last to pair up, they were also the last\\n\\nto enter the Course. Miriam Camp, the lead-in facilitator,5 assisted their entry, the\\n\\nfirst step of which was climbing up the short cargo net in a stomach down position.\\n\\nThey then moved to a platform on the lower level of the course, where another\\n\\nfacilitator was waiting. They waited for a pair of participants who had changed their\\n\\nmind about attempting the Course to come back down, and then they climbed an\\n\\n       5\\n       Miriam Camp testified in her deposition that once all the participants were on\\nthe course, she retreated to a shed under the tower.\\n                                             5\\n incline ramp to reach the top level of the Course. Although it had been raining\\n\\nintermittently earlier in the day, it was not raining when they began the Course.\\n\\nHowever, Bailey testified that by the time they were waiting at the platform it had\\n\\nbegun to “heavily drizzle”and that, as she and her student partner reached the top\\n\\nlevel, the intensity of the rain increased, fog-like conditions developed, and visibility\\n\\ndeteriorated, which, she said, was exacerbated by rainwater dripping off their helmets\\n\\nand eyelashes.\\n\\n      Bailey testified that when she and her partner reached the second element on\\n\\nthe top level, which consisted of a sliding platform, she felt “unstable” and “unsafe”\\n\\nso she shortened her safety lanyard. The rain had increased in intensity by this time,\\n\\nand Coleman Poje, who was the lead facilitator that day, made the decision to evacuate\\n\\nthe Course. Poje said in his deposition that he made this decision because it was\\n\\nraining too hard for the participants to comfortably complete the Course, and he and\\n\\nother witnesses testified that they did not consider the evacuation to be an emergency\\n\\nsituation because there was no lightning in the area. However, one of the facilitators\\n\\ntestified that, due to the intensity of the rain, she considered the evacuation to be an\\n\\nemergency situation.\\n\\n\\n                                           6\\n       Although Camp Highlands did not have a written Course evacuation plan, the\\n\\ngeneral protocol was for the participants to go to the nearest exit point since the goal\\n\\nwas to get people off the Course as quickly as possible. Because Bailey and her student\\n\\npartner had been the last to enter the Course, they were the team closest to the\\n\\nbeginning, i.e., the short cargo net, and Poje yelled at them to turn around and go back\\n\\nthat way. The other participants who were still on the Course were closer to the zip\\n\\nline, and Poje had instructed them to keep going that way, where they could also be\\n\\nbelayed down the climbing tower by the staff.\\n\\n      As instructed, Bailey and her partner turned around to go back toward the short\\n\\ncargo net. Although a facilitator should have accompanied each group, and Bailey had\\n\\nseen a female staff member in her vicinity earlier, she did not see any staff members\\n\\nnear her position as she began to navigate the Course in the direction of the short\\n\\ncargo net.6 Brittany Blocker, who was the in-course facilitator stationed closest to\\n\\nBailey, testified that she also made her way back to the short cargo net so that she\\n\\ncould exit the Course, but that she did not see Bailey and her partner or any other\\n\\n\\n      6\\n        Bailey testified that at one point she saw a male individual “swinging like\\nTarzan” along the side of the elements and she yelled at him to stop, but he did not\\nappear to hear her, and he kept going and then disappeared out of sight.\\n                                           7\\n participants along the way, so she thought that everyone had made it off the Course.\\n\\nBlocker also testified in her deposition that she may not have seen Bailey on the\\n\\nCourse because of the weather. Believing the Course to be empty, Blocker exited the\\n\\nCourse and walked to the tower area to assist with storing equipment. It appears to be\\n\\nundisputed that the only procedure Camp Highland used to ensure that everyone had\\n\\nbeen evacuated from the Course was for the facilitators to perform an informal visual\\n\\ninspection but there was no evidence that a specific facilitator was assigned to perform\\n\\nthe inspection or that there was any procedure in place to make sure that someone had\\n\\nin fact checked that the Course was clear.\\n\\n      Shortly after Blocker exited the Course,7 Bailey and her partner made it back to\\n\\nthe short cargo net. Bailey testified that her priority was to protect the student she was\\n\\nwith, so when they reached the short cargo net and realized no one was there to help,\\n\\nshe decided to descend the net and then go find someone to help the student down the\\n\\nnet. She testified that she first attempted to descend the cargo net as if she was\\n\\nclimbing down a ladder, but that her shortened safety rope prevented her from doing\\n\\nso and that, when she attempted to lengthen it, she was unable to manipulate the rope\\n\\n      7\\n       Blocker estimated that she was on the ground for less than five minutes when\\nBailey was injured.\\n                                            8\\n due to the rope being wet and her hands being wet and cold. She then decided to walk\\n\\nface first down the net, but her foot slipped and, because her safety line was too short,\\n\\nshe started sliding down the cable that ran the length of the structure in front of the\\n\\ncargo net as if it were a zip line. Bailey grabbed the cable to slow her descent, but she\\n\\nhad to let go because the metal “burned” her hand and pieces of metal were being\\n\\nembedded into her hand. Bailey said that, as she was going down the cable, she rolled\\n\\ninto a ball to protect her body and that this caused her to rotate slightly and slam into\\n\\na wooden beam behind her. She bounced off the beam and then struck it again; she\\n\\nthen fell to the ground and briefly lost consciousness. Bailey was transported to the\\n\\nhospital, where it was determined that she had numerous fractures in her lower back,\\n\\nextensive bruising to parts of her body, a misalignment of her SI joint located on the\\n\\nbase of her spine, and burns on her hand. At the time of her deposition two years later,\\n\\nBailey was still undergoing treatment and more surgeries were anticipated. Bailey\\n\\ncontinued to experience problems functioning in almost all aspects of her life, and due\\n\\nto her mobility and other issues, could not work, go out in public by herself, drive her\\n\\nchildren, or otherwise care for her family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           9\\n       2. Having set out the relevant facts, we now turn to the legal analysis. There is\\n\\nno dispute that Bailey waived any claims she might have had for simple negligence by\\n\\nexecuting a valid release.8 See Barbazza v. Intl. Motor Sports Assn., \\n245 Ga. App. 790\\n,\\n\\n792 (2) (\\n538 SE2d 859\\n) (2000). However, while it is well-settled that a release such\\n\\nas the one Bailey signed shields a tortfeasor from claims of simple negligence, it is\\n\\nequally well-established that a party may recover for acts of gross negligence even\\n\\nwhen claims of simple negligence have been waived. \\nId.\\n at (3); Trustees of Trinity\\n\\nCollege v. Ferris, \\n228 Ga. App. 476\\n, 476 (1) (\\n491 SE2d 909\\n) (1997).\\n\\n      Our Supreme Court has defined gross negligence as follows:\\n\\n\\n      8\\n       The Release Bailey signed stated as follows:\\n      Camp Highland . . . is an adventure challenge camp that provides\\n      voluntary participation in strenuous and potentially dangerous activities.\\n      The risk of injury from the activities involved in this program is\\n      significant, including the potential for permanent paralysis and death,\\n      and while the rules, equipment and personal discipline may reduce the\\n      risk of serious injury, the potential of injury/death does exist. I assume\\n      full responsibility for my . . . participation. . . . I, for myself, or on behalf\\n      of my . . . heirs, assignors and personal representatives do hereby release\\n      and hold harmless Camp Highland, . . .

In other words, gross negligence has\\n      been defined as the equivalent to the failure to exercise even a slight\\n      degree of care or lack of the diligence that even careless men are\\n      accustomed to exercise.\\n\\n\\n(Punctuation omitted.)

App. 207\\n, 217 (3) (c) (\\n855 SE2d\\n\\n103\\n) (2021) (same).\\n\\n      “When facts alleged as constituting gross negligence are such that there is room\\n\\nfor difference of opinion between reasonable men as to whether or not negligence can\\n\\nbe inferred, and if so whether in degree the negligence amounts to gross negligence,\\n\\nthe right to draw the inference is within the exclusive province of the jury.” (Citation\\n\\nand punctuation omitted.) Georgia Trails, 359 Ga. App. at 217 (3) (c). See also Trinity\\n\\nCollege, \\n228 Ga. App. at 478\\n (1). However, “[i]n cases wherein the evidence allegedly\\n\\nsupporting the accusations of gross negligence is plain and indisputable, . . . the court\\n\\nmay resolve the questions of whether the defendant acted with gross negligence as a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           11\\n matter of law.” (Citations omitted.) Newton v. Jacobs, \\n358 Ga. App. 180\\n, 186 (2) (\\n854\\n\\nSE2d 359\\n) (2021). See also Johnson, \\n294 Ga. at 78\\n (same).\\n\\n      Here, there is no real dispute that Camp Highland was negligent to some degree\\n\\nin leaving Bailey and her partner on the Course without supervision in violation of\\n\\nCamp policies, and, in granting summary judgment to Camp Highland, the trial court\\n\\nacknowledged that “a breach of care occurred to some degree” and that Camp\\n\\nHighland’s actions were “arguably negligent.” However, the trial court found that\\n\\nthis negligence did not rise to the level of gross negligence, reasoning that “this lapse\\n\\noccurred for only a very brief but chaotic period of time during a heavy rainstorm.”\\n\\nCertainly, a reasonable person might view these events in this light and conclude that\\n\\nCamp Highland’s actions, or inactions, during the evacuation did not constitute gross\\n\\nnegligence. However, it is equally possible that a reasonable person might look at these\\n\\nsame facts and conclude that the very existence of these circumstances should have\\n\\nalerted even the least diligent person of the need to ensure that Camp policies were\\n\\nfollowed during weather related evacuations and that no one was left unattended on\\n\\nthe Course. At least one witness who had several years experience at the Camp\\n\\ntestified that it was the worst rainstorm she had seen while on the Course, and several\\n\\n\\n                                           12\\n witnesses, including Blocker, surmised that this may have contributed to\\n\\nmiscommunication and the failure to ensure Bailey was off the Course. Further, while\\n\\nBlocker testified that she “typically” looks at the Course to make sure it is clear, there\\n\\nis no evidence that Blocker, or any of the other facilitators, did in fact perform such\\n\\na visual inspection on the day that Bailey was injured. Under these circumstances –\\n\\na rainstorm so intense that both vision and communication may have been impeded\\n\\n– reasonable persons might find that relying on only an informal plan for some\\n\\nunspecified Camp worker to perform a visual check of the Course to ensure\\n\\nparticipants were safely off the Course amounted to a failure to exercise even the\\n\\nslightest diligence or degree of care, thus rising to the level of gross negligence. In\\n\\nother words, reasonable persons might or might not consider it grossly negligent to\\n\\nhave no formal plan in place to ensure that, during an evacuation, participants were\\n\\nnot left unattended to exit the Course on their own and no formal plan in place to\\n\\nensure that participants made it safely off the Course before the facilitators left the\\n\\negress areas unattended. Accordingly, the trial court’s order is reversed to the extent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            13\\n that summary judgment was granted to Camp Highland on Bailey’s claim for gross\\n\\nnegligence.9\\n\\n      3. We reach a different result on Bailey’s claim for punitive damages and\\n\\nattorney fees.\\n\\n      Georgia law is clear that punitive damages are authorized in tort cases only\\n\\nwhen “it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant’s actions\\n\\nshowed willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want\\n\\nof care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to\\n\\nconsequences.” OCGA § 51-12-5.1 (b). “[N]egligence, even gross negligence, is\\n\\ninadequate to support a punitive damage award.” Poverty Destroyed Forever v. Vision\\n\\nFinancial Svcs., \\n360 Ga. App. 691\\n, 693 (2) (\\n859 SE2d 612\\n) (2021). Here, however,\\n\\nother than pointing to instances of what she claims are gross negligence, Bailey has\\n\\nmade no meaningful argument as to her entitlement to punitive damages or pointed\\n\\n\\n      9\\n        It follows that summary judgment is also reversed on Bailey’s husband’s\\nderivative claim for loss of consortium. We note that other issues, such as whether\\nBailey should have kept shouting for help instead of attempting to descend the net on\\nher own, should also be decided by a jury. Further, it will be for a jury to resolve any\\nconflicts in the evidence based on deposition testimony that Bailey told a Camp\\nemployee that she fell because she lost her balance while reaching out for her student\\npartner who had slipped.\\n                                          14\\n to any such supporting evidence. Bailey has made even less of an argument to show\\n\\nwhy summary judgment should not have been granted on her claim for attorney fees\\n\\nunder OCGA § 13-6-11.10 Notably, she has not set out the requirements of that code\\n\\nsection or specified the exact basis under the code section for her claim and has not\\n\\nmade any real attempt to show her entitlement to such fees. Accordingly, we affirm\\n\\nthe grant of summary judgment to Camp Highland on Bailey’s claim for punitive\\n\\ndamages and attorney fees under OCGA § 13-6-11.\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part. Barnes, P. J., and Gobeil, J.,\\n\\nconcur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      10\\n         That section provides as follows: “The expenses of litigation generally shall\\nnot be allowed as a part of the damages; but where the plaintiff has specially pleaded\\nand has made prayer therefor and where the defendant has acted in bad faith, has been\\nstubbornly litigious, or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense, the\\njury may allow them.”\\n                                          15\\n '),\n",

JOHNNY BRETT GREGORY v. TAMMY Y. JACKSON et al.\\n\\n      In November 2022, Tammy Y. Jackson and Pamela Cooper filed a partition\\naction against defendants Syble Gregory and Bridget Lynn Suttles. A month later,\\nSuttles filed a separate quiet title action involving the same parties and property in her\\ncapacity as the executor of the estate of James Lee Cooper. Jackson filed a motion for\\nconsolidation in each case, but the trial court did not rule on either motion. Syble\\nGregory died, and a suggestion of death was filed in the partition action in March\\n2023. No substitution of party has been made, and it appears that the partition action\\nis ongoing.\\n      On May 29, 2024, the trial court dismissed the quiet title action for lack of\\nservice and joinder issues. Johnny Brett Gregory — Syble Gregory’s son — has filed\\na pro se application for discretionary review challenging the court’s dismissal of the\\nquiet title action. Jackson has filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Johnny Brett\\nGregory lacks standing to appeal. We agree.\\n      “It is well settled that only a party to the case can appeal from a judgment, or\\none who has sought to become a party as by way of intervention and has been denied\\nthe right to do so.” Degussa Wall Systems v. Sharp, \\n286 Ga. App. 349\\n, 350 (\\n648 SE2d\\n687\\n) (2007) (citation and punctuation omitted); see also OCGA § 5-6-33 (a) (granting\\na right of appeal to “[e]ither party in any civil case”) (emphasis supplied). Further,\\nparties can only be added by court order. See OCGA § 9-11-21 (providing that parties\\nmay be added “by order of the court”); O’Brien v. Builders Ins., \\n350 Ga. App. 77\\n, 78\\n(2) (\\n827 SE2d 917\\n) (2019) (“Intervention does not occur until the court enters an\\n order permitting it.”) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n      Here, there is no indication that Johnny Brett Gregory ever sought — or was\\ndenied the opportunity — to intervene in the quiet title action. Although Johnny Brett\\nGregory asserts that he was joined as a party pursuant to a filed proposed order, the\\npurported ruling is not only limited to the partition action, the proposed order is of no\\neffect because it is unsigned by the judge. See OCGA § 9-11-58 (b) (no judgment is\\neffective for any purpose until such judgment, “signed by the judge,” is filed with the\\nclerk). Thus, pretermitting whether a discretionary application was appropriate here,1\\nin the absence of a court order adding Johnny Brett Gregory as a party in the quiet title\\naction, he lacks standing to appeal. Accordingly, Jackson’s motion to dismiss this\\napplication is hereby GRANTED, and the application is hereby DISMISSED. Johnny\\nBrett Gregory’s motions to supplement the record and for the Court to take judicial\\nnotice of certain facts are DENIED AS MOOT.\\n\\n                                         Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\\n                                           Clerk’s Office, Atlanta,____________________\\n                                                                       07/09/2024\\n                                                    I certify that the above is a true extract from\\n                                         the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\\n                                                   Witness my signature and the seal of said court\\n                                         hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\\n\\n\\n                                                                                           , Clerk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      1\\n        Because the application materials contain no order consolidating the cases, the\\ntrial court order dismissing the quiet title action was a final judgment, and no\\nprovision of OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) appears to apply.\\n '),\n",

JENNIFER WARNER v. JEFFREY ESPITIA et al.\\n\\n       Jennifer Warner brought this civil RICO1 action against her ex-husband and his\\nfiancé, alleging that they made false statements in connection with a child support\\nproceeding. Warner also sought punitive damages and attorney fees. The defendants\\nfiled an answer and counterclaim, followed by a motion to dismiss the complaint. The\\ntrial court granted the motion to dismiss, finding that Warner “fails to have any claim\\nupon which relief can be granted,” and it declined to award attorney fees. In its order,\\nthe court explicitly stated that it considered exhibits attached to Warner’s response\\nto the motion to dismiss. At Warner’s request, the court certified its order for\\nimmediate review, and this timely application followed.\\n       Based on the application materials, it appears that the trial court’s order may\\nbe a final order disposing of all claims in the case.

Choate, \\n334 Ga. App. 574\\n, 576 (1) (a) (\\n780 SE2d 25\\n) (2015) (punctuation\\nomitted). Even if there are issues remaining below, “[t]he trial court, by considering\\nmatters outside of the pleadings that were presented by the parties, in effect converted\\nthe motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.” Johnson v.

ALLEN v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n        PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n        The right to trial by jury is the cornerstone of our justice\\n\\nsystem. “That right is no mere procedural formality, but a\\n\\nfundamental reservation of power in our constitutional structure.\\n\\nJust as suffrage ensures the people’s ultimate control in the\\n\\nlegislative and executive branches, jury trial is meant to ensure\\n\\ntheir control in the judiciary.” Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296,\\n\\n305–306 (124 SCt 2531, 159 LE2d 403) (2004). Accordingly, a critical\\n\\nelement of that right is that certain questions are to be decided not\\n\\nby judges, but by jurors — ordinary members of a defendant’s local\\n\\ncommunity, informed by local mores and values.\\n\\n        The General Assembly has determined that one such question\\n\\nis whether a killing immediately following a serious provocation\\n should be punished as voluntary manslaughter instead of murder.\\n\\nSee OCGA § 16-5-2. When any evidence of such serious provocation\\n\\nexists, it is for the jury, not a judge, to decide whether the\\n\\nprovocation was sufficient to mitigate the culpability. This is such a\\n\\ncase.\\n\\n        Sherman Lamont Allen appeals his conviction for malice\\n\\nmurder in connection with the beating death of his cousin, Treston\\n\\nSmith. In his sole enumeration of error, Allen argues that the trial\\n\\ncourt erred in denying his request to instruct the jury on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter as a lesser offense of murder. Because there was\\n\\nsufficient evidence to support the jury instruction, the court erred in\\n\\nrefusing to give it. And because the State has failed to carry its\\n\\nburden to show that it is highly probable that the error did not\\n\\ncontribute to the verdict, that error requires us to reverse Allen’s\\n\\nmurder conviction. 1\\n\\n\\n        1 The crimes occurred on March 16, 2017. On April 25, 2017, an Elbert\\n\\nCounty grand jury indicted Allen for one count of malice murder, two counts of\\nfelony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count of aggravated\\nbattery. Following a March 2019 trial, a jury found Allen guilty on all counts.\\n\\n                                       2\\n       1. The evidence at trial showed as follows.2 Allen and Tia Allen\\n\\nbegan a romantic relationship around 2005. They lived together,\\n\\nraised Tia’s son together, and had two children of their own.\\n\\nAlthough the couple never married, they considered themselves to\\n\\nbe married. Tia referred to Allen as her “fiancé” and considered\\n\\nherself married, and Allen claimed that Tia would introduce him as\\n\\nher “husband.”\\n\\n      In December 2016, Tia became friends with Smith, who was\\n\\nmarried and had children of his own. They began talking on a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trial court sentenced Allen to serve life in prison with the possibility of\\nparole for malice murder. Although the trial court purported to merge the\\nfelony murder counts into the malice murder conviction, the felony murder\\ncounts were vacated by operation of law, and the other counts merged into\\nmalice murder. See Ware v. State, 302 Ga. 792, 794-795 (3) (809 SE2d 762)\\n(2018). On April 22, 2019, Allen filed a motion for new trial. After a hearing,\\nthe trial court denied the motion on February 13, 2023. Allen filed a timely\\nnotice of appeal. On appeal, Allen’s new counsel moved to withdraw, so this\\nCourt struck the case from the docket and remanded for a hearing on that\\nmotion. See Case No. S23A0845 (May 31, 2023 order). On remand, the trial\\ncourt granted counsel’s motion to withdraw, and Allen obtained new counsel.\\nAllen filed a new notice of appeal on September 12, 2023, and the case was\\ndocketed in this Court for the term beginning in December 2023 and submitted\\nfor a decision on the briefs.\\n       2 Because this case turns on an assessment of whether an error was\\n\\nharmless, we lay out the evidence fully, rather than in the light most favorable\\nto the jury’s verdicts. See Moore v. State, 315 Ga. 263, 264 (1) n.2 (882 SE2d\\n227) (2022).\\n                                       3\\n regular basis as friends and eventually developed a sexual\\n\\nrelationship that Tia described as an affair. Sometime in January,\\n\\nAllen heard a rumor about Tia and Smith. In a police interview,\\n\\nAllen stated that he got a call after work from someone who asked if\\n\\nhe and Tia were “okay” because someone “caught” Tia and Smith in\\n\\na car. Although Allen’s description of what transpired was not very\\n\\nclear, he said that he then confronted Tia and told her that if she\\n\\nwere “really messin’ around” then they should go their separate\\n\\nways, and that Tia denied being with Smith. Allen testified that he\\n\\nconfronted Tia sometime in January. According to Allen, Tia also\\n\\ntold him to ask her friend who was present, but Allen declined\\n\\nbecause he knew Tia’s friend would lie for her about the rumor he\\n\\nheard.\\n\\n     According to Tia, Allen then “let it go,” and she continued her\\n\\naffair with Smith. According to Tia, she first had sex with Smith in\\n\\nFebruary 2017, and she claimed to have sex with him on two\\n\\noccasions. She said she would meet Smith when Allen was asleep or\\n\\nat work, and they would travel from Elberton to Atlanta to be\\n\\n                                 4\\n together.\\n\\n     On the evening of March 15, Allen went to work. At 3:19 a.m.\\n\\non the morning of March 16, he left work. Around 3:50 a.m., after\\n\\ngetting breakfast, he went to a gas station and drove around to the\\n\\nback. Smith had parked his tractor-trailer there, and Tia and Smith\\n\\nwere together in her parked car nearby. According to Tia, they were\\n\\nin the car together for a few minutes talking and kissing, and then\\n\\nSmith got out of Tia’s car so that she could drive to work in Athens.\\n\\n     Smith had just gotten out of Tia’s car when Allen drove behind\\n\\nthe gas station. Allen got out of his vehicle, hit the front driver-side\\n\\nwindow of Tia’s car with his hand, and said, “B**ch, what you think\\n\\nyou doing?” Tia drove off to work. She testified that Allen appeared\\n\\nto be “pretty angry” when he hit her car and yelled at her.\\n\\n     After Tia drove off, Allen engaged Smith in a verbal altercation\\n\\nthat led to a physical fight. Surveillance videos from the gas station,\\n\\nwhich were played for the jury at trial, captured some, but not all,\\n\\nof the fight, because a truck obstructed the view. The video\\n\\nrecordings do not show the start of the fight. At some point, Allen\\n\\n                                   5\\n and Smith came into the camera’s view. Allen, who was wearing\\n\\nsteel-toed boots, could be seen beating and kicking Smith, who was\\n\\non the ground at that point. Allen then got into his vehicle, drove\\n\\nforward a short distance, stopped his vehicle, backed up, got out, and\\n\\nresumed beating Smith while Smith was lying on the ground. Allen\\n\\nthen left the scene. According to the owner of the gas station, who\\n\\ncalled 911, Allen approached Smith, pulled him out of his tractor-\\n\\ntrailer, “beat him,” and repeatedly kicked him in the face while he\\n\\nwas lying on the ground.\\n\\n     Driving home from the gas station, Allen called Tia multiple\\n\\ntimes to ask “what’s going on” and called several relatives to tell\\n\\nthem that he “got in a fight.” He showered and changed clothes at\\n\\nhome.\\n\\n     Law enforcement officers responded to the scene and found\\n\\nSmith “face down . . . in the gravel, dirt area[.]”The coroner\\n\\npronounced Smith dead at the scene. The front of Smith’s body was\\n\\nmuddy but not his back. Shortly after 6:00 a.m., Allen turned\\n\\nhimself in at the Elbert County Sheriff’s Office.\\n\\n                                  6\\n      Dr. Colin Hebert, the medical examiner who performed Smith’s\\n\\nautopsy, noted that Smith’s “head had a lot of swelling and bruising,\\n\\nlacerations, and scrapes, abrasions.” Dr. Hebert found gravel\\n\\nembedded in Smith’s face, mouth, and tongue. Smith did not have\\n\\n“much in the way of injury on his body below [his] head[.]”Dr. Hebert\\n\\nconcluded that Smith died of blunt force trauma of the head.\\n\\n     At trial, Allen testified in his own defense, stating the\\n\\nfollowing. He left work before his shift ended because he completed\\n\\nhis assignments. He went directly to a restaurant, ordered food to\\n\\ngo, and waited there about 30 minutes because the cook was on a\\n\\nbreak. After he left the restaurant and neared his home, he decided\\n\\nthat he wanted to “take a little detour” and “go riding a round,”\\n\\nwhich he stated was normal for him to do. He said that he stopped\\n\\nat the gas station to adjust a window that was rattling and then\\n\\ncircled behind the gas station to turn around, which he also stated\\n\\nwas his normal practice. Allen claimed that he did not expect Tia\\n\\nand Smith to be behind the gas station, but when he rounded the\\n\\ncorner, he recognized Tia in her car and saw Smith getting out of the\\n\\n                                 7\\n car. Smith then walked away from the car.\\n\\n     Allen claimed that he got out of his vehicle and walked toward\\n\\nTia’s car. “I noticed them then,” Allen testified, “and I’m like two and\\n\\ntwo together like this, uh, so it’s really true.” He admitted to\\n\\napproaching her car, hitting it with the palm of his hand, and calling\\n\\nTia a “b**ch.” He said he was angry, mad, and hurt, because the\\n\\nperson he saw Tia with was the same person whom he had asked\\n\\nher about before and the person she had denied having an affair\\n\\nwith. Allen said that Tia looked at him like, “damn, I’ve been\\n\\ncaught.” Allen acknowledged that he then approached Smith but\\n\\ndenied pulling Smith out of his tractor-trailer. Allen said that he and\\n\\nSmith talked for two to five minutes before fighting. Allen testified\\n\\nthat he asked Smith what was going on, and Smith was “telling\\n\\n[Allen] something was going on between them.” When asked\\n\\nspecifically what Allen asked Smith, Allen said that he referenced\\n\\nSmith’s status as a married man with his own family and asked,\\n\\n“why you trying to, you know, destroy mine; f**king up mine?” Allen\\n\\ntestified that Smith merely responded to each question by repeating,\\n\\n                                   8\\n “man, f**k you” with a smirk on his face. Allen also said that Smith\\n\\ninitiated the fight by punching Allen “dead in my face” and that the\\n\\ntwo men went to the ground where Allen put Smith in a chokehold.\\n\\nAllen stated that when he stood up to leave, he “got stabbed in the\\n\\nleg” with a knife, so Allen began fighting again, took the knife from\\n\\nSmith, and got into his vehicle. 3 Allen said that he stopped his\\n\\nvehicle and went back to kick Smith some more because he was\\n\\nangry that Smith had stabbed him. Allen denied ever kicking Smith\\n\\nin the face or head.\\n\\n     Although Allen said at one point in his testimony that he was\\n\\nnot “angry like vicious mad,” Allen clarified that he was angry when\\n\\nhe saw Tia and Smith. And throughout his testimony, Allen\\n\\nrepeatedly said that he was angry when he was asking Smith\\n\\nquestions. And he said he was “still angry and mad” when he\\n\\nreturned to continue fighting Smith. Allen testified that he did not\\n\\nintend to injure or kill Smith and was merely trying to protect\\n\\n\\n     3 An officer who was present when Allen turned himself in testified that\\n\\nphotographs admitted at trial of Allen’s injuries showed Allen’s “left thigh\\nwhere he had a cut on it.”\\n                                     9\\n himself.\\n\\n     During his police interview, which was recorded and played for\\n\\nthe jury, Allen said that he drove to the gas station because he had\\n\\na “feeling of something being off.” Referring to Tia as his “fiancé and\\n\\nthe mother of [my] kids,” Allen stated that when he approached her,\\n\\nhe asked, “why you lie?” Allen also said he told Smith, “you married,\\n\\nyou got your own, you got everything,” “you got a wife,” and asked,\\n\\n“you really would do this to my family?”, and asked “why?”, “why\\n\\nme?,” and “why would you, man?” Allen said he was “hurt” because\\n\\nSmith was his cousin; Tia was the mother of his children, the woman\\n\\nhe wanted to be with for the rest of his life, his wife; and he wanted\\n\\nonly answers, which Smith would not provide. In describing the\\n\\nfight, Allen said he and Smith were tussling, they began hitting each\\n\\nother and fell to the ground. When Allen got up, Allen stated, he\\n\\nkicked Smith and told him to get up, but Smith did not move. Allen\\n\\nsaid he thought he had merely “knocked [Smith] out or something.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  10\\n Allen had not seen the knife until after he got off the ground.4 He\\n\\nthen grabbed the knife and got into his car. Allen stated that on the\\n\\nway home from the gas station, he threw that knife out the window.\\n\\nAllen, sobbing in the interview, said he was not a violent person,\\n\\nnever fought anyone before, and did “not know what happened.”\\n\\n      At trial, Allen requested a jury charge on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter and objected to the trial court’s refusal to give it. In\\n\\ndenying the request, the trial court focused on Allen’s trial testimony\\n\\nwhere he stated that he acted in self-defense and did not intend to\\n\\nkill the victim, noting that voluntary manslaughter required an\\n\\nintent to kill. 5 Allen was found guilty of malice murder and other\\n\\noffenses and sentenced to life on the malice murder count.\\n\\n      2. Allen’s sole claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 There is no indication Allen saw the knife until after the fight started\\n\\nand Smith was unconscious.\\n      5 The trial court’s statement about intent being a necessary element of\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter was partially correct: when voluntary manslaughter\\nmitigates malice murder, the element of intent to kill is required. See Carter\\nv. State, 298 Ga. 867, 870 (785 SE2d 274) (2016). But when voluntary\\nmanslaughter mitigates felony murder, the intent to kill is not a necessary\\nelement; instead, only the intent necessary to commit the predicate felony is\\nrequired. See id.\\n                                      11\\n denying his request to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\nOCGA § 16-5-2 (a) provides:\\n\\n     A person commits the offense of voluntary manslaughter\\n     when he causes the death of another human being under\\n     circumstances which would otherwise be murder and if he\\n     acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and\\n     irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation\\n     sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person;\\n     however, if there should have been an interval between\\n     the provocation and the killing sufficient for the voice of\\n     reason and humanity to be heard, of which the jury in all\\n     cases shall be the judge, the killing shall be attributed to\\n     deliberate revenge and be punished as murder.6\\n\\n\\n     6 The dissent’s approach and our disagreement herein expose a tension\\n\\nin our case law, albeit one we need not resolve today. This tension arguably\\nstems from the change in the voluntary manslaughter statute in 1968. Prior to\\n1969, the voluntary manslaughter statutory provision remained materially the\\nsame since its initial adoption in 1833, and that 1833 provision provided:\\n\\n     In all cases of voluntary manslaughter, there must be some actual\\n     assault upon the person killing, or an attempt by the person killed\\n     to commit a serious personal injury on the person killing.\\n     Provocation by words, threats, menaces, or contemptuous jestures\\n     [sic] shall in no case be sufficient to free the person killing from the\\n     guilt and crime of murder. The killing must be the result of that\\n     sudden, violent impulse of passion, supposed to be irresistible: for\\n     if there should appear to have been an interval between the assault\\n     or provocation given, and the homicide, sufficient for the voice of\\n     reason and humanity to be heard, the killing shall be attributed to\\n     deliberate revenge, and be punished as murder.\\n\\nLaws 1833, Cobb’s 1851 Digest, § 34, pp. 783-784. When the laws of Georgia\\nwere codified in the 1860 Code, the voluntary manslaughter statute expanded\\n\\n                                       12\\n adequate provocation beyond actual or attempt assault to include “other\\nequivalent circumstances to justify the excitement of passion, and to exclude\\nall idea of deliberation or malice, either express or implied[,]” but it still\\nretained the exclusion of provocation by words. See 1860 Code § 4222. In 1968,\\nthe current version of the voluntary manslaughter statute was enacted and\\nomitted the language stating that “[p]rovocation by words, threats, menaces,\\nor contemptuous jestures shall in no case be sufficient to free the person killing\\nfrom the guilt and crime of murder.” See Ga. L. 1968, p. 1276, § 1.\\n       When the General Assembly changes the language of a statute, that\\ntypically signals an intent to change the meaning of the statute. See Middleton\\nv. State, 309 Ga. 337, 345 (3) (846 SE2d 73) (2020) (it is “a core principle of\\nstatutory interpretation that changes in statutory language generally indicate\\nan intent to change the meaning of the statute.” (citation and punctuation\\nomitted)); see also Transp. Ins. Co. v. El Chico Rests., Inc., 271 Ga. 774, 776\\n(524 SE2d 486) (1999) (presuming that the legislature’s removal of limiting\\nlanguage from a law demonstrated a “considered choice” to remove such\\nlimits). Yet, despite the General Assembly dropping the “provocation by words”\\nlanguage, we nevertheless held that “while not made an express provision of\\n[the voluntary manslaughter statute], [the rule that provocation by words\\nalone is insufficient] remains a part of the current law of voluntary\\nmanslaughter.” Brooks v. State, 249 Ga. 583, 585 (1) (292 SE2d 694) (1982).\\nBrooks cited Aguilar v. State, 240 Ga. 830, 833 (242 SE2d 620) (1978), in\\nsupport, but Aguilar engaged in no meaningful analysis. Curiously, despite\\nstating that provocation by words alone was still not sufficient provocation\\nunder the new statutory regime, Brooks then carved out the exception for when\\nwords disclose adulterous conduct. 249 Ga. at 586 (“While it is true that the\\nvictim used words to make the defendant aware of her adultery, we find the\\ndefendant’s adulterous conduct rather than the words describing her conduct\\nserved as the serious provocation sufficient to excite a sudden, violent, and\\nirresistible passion.” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n       It is debatable whether the General Assembly intended in 1968 to keep\\nthe old rule in place. The 1968 revisions to the criminal code relied, at least in\\npart, on the Model Penal Code, which was completed in 1962. See Danuel v.\\nState, 262 Ga. 349, 354-355 (418 SE2d 45) (1992) (Bell, P.J., concurring\\nspecially) (noting the reliance on the Model Penal Code by the Criminal Law\\nStudy Committee for the 1968 Code). Scholarship on the issue of adequate\\nprovocation reveals that, although the common law largely restricted\\nprovocation to four categories (mutual combat, sudden injury, false arrest, and\\nadultery), by the time the Model Penal Code was enacted, this restrictive rule\\n\\n                                       13\\n A trial court must “grant the defendant’s request for a charge on the\\n\\nlesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter if there is any\\n\\nevidence, however slight, to support such a charge.” Wilkerson v.\\n\\nState, 317 Ga. 242, 247 (2) (892 SE2d 737) (2023) (cleaned up). It is\\n\\na question of law whether any such slight evidence exists.

Over time, the categories gave way to a more generalized\\nprovocation defined by how [a] reasonable person would be expected to react.\\nThe modern approach, exemplified by the Model Penal Code (“MPC”), grants\\nfar more latitude in defining adequate provocation: Homicide which would\\notherwise be murder is committed under the influence of extreme mental or\\nemotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse.\\nWhile reasonableness is included in the code, the appropriateness of the\\ndefendant’s actions [is] determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor’s\\nsituation under the circumstances as he believes them to be. This method\\nleaves it to the jury to determine whether the explanation, regardless of the\\nprovoking action, is sufficient.” (footnotes and punctuation omitted)).\\n      No party has briefed the issue of whether Brooks’s interpretation of the\\npredecessor to OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) was correct (and if not, whether it should\\nnevertheless be retained under stare decisis). And it is not necessary to resolve\\nthis question here, as the existing legal framework regarding discovery of\\nadulterous conduct is adequate to resolve Allen’s claim.\\n                                       14\\n      Our case law has long recognized that discovering a partner’s\\n\\ninfidelity is generally sufficient provocation to warrant a charge on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter. See, e.g., Mays v. State, 88 Ga. 399, 403 (14\\n\\nSE 560) (1891) (describing when voluntary manslaughter is\\n\\nauthorized); see also Soto v. State, 303 Ga. 517, 519 (1) (813 SE2d\\n\\n343) (2018) (“Although sexual jealousy can be provocation sufficient\\n\\nto warrant a conviction for manslaughter even where the defendant\\n\\nand the victim are not married, it is for the jury to determine\\n\\nwhether the actions alleged to have provoked the defendant actually\\n\\noccurred and whether these actions were sufficient provocation to\\n\\nexcite the deadly passion of a reasonable person.” (citation omitted)).\\n\\nEarly on, this was limited to discovering that one’s spouse was\\n\\ncommitting adultery. See id. (stating that murder could be reduced\\n\\nto manslaughter if the defendant killed the victim after discovering\\n\\nthe victim and the defendant’s wife had committed an adulterous\\n\\nact); see also Stevens v. State, 137 Ga. 520, 522 (73 SE 737) (1912)\\n\\n(“the catching of a man in adultery with one’s wife” could authorize\\n\\na jury charge on voluntary manslaughter). But the rationale\\n\\n                                  15\\n underlying these cases extends beyond situations where the\\n\\ndefendant is “married to one of the parties caught in the\\n\\ncompromising situation.” Goforth v. Sate, 271 Ga. 700, 701 (1) (523\\n\\nSE2d 868) (1999).\\n\\n      Witnessing one’s partner actually commit an “adulterous act”\\n\\nis certainly one manner of discovering a partner’s infidelity that can\\n\\nbe sufficiently provoking as to warrant a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ncharge. See Mays, 88 Ga. at 403.7 But one can also be sufficiently\\n\\n\\n      7 The dissent relies heavily on Mays as purportedly setting forth a bright-\\n\\nline standard that a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on voluntary\\nmanslaughter only when he kills upon catching his partner in an adulterous\\nact. But Mays was answering a different, albeit somewhat related, question, so\\nit does not hold what the dissent thinks it does (never mind that cases pre-\\ndating the 1968 amendment to the voluntary manslaughter statute may not\\napply). There, the defendant was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter,\\nrather than murder, and his primary argument on appeal was that the killing\\nwas justifiable, meaning he was not culpable at all. 88 Ga. at 402 (“[T]he able\\ncounsel for [appellant] contended that the verdict for voluntary manslaughter\\nwas erroneous, that the jury should have found Mays justifiable in killing the\\ndeceased.”). The court used language regarding what constituted adequate\\nprovocation in the context of adultery, but it was not answering whether a\\nvoluntary manslaughter charge should have been given. Instead, it was\\naddressing the question of whether the jury should have acquitted Mays\\naltogether, rather than find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter, based on\\nthe theory that he was preventing adultery. Id. at 403. The court reviewed the\\nevidence and concluded that it showed that “it was not necessary at that time\\nto kill the deceased to prevent the adultery[.]” Id. at 404 (emphasis added).\\n       The court stated in passing that the provocation was “intolerably great,”\\n\\n                                       16\\n provoked by finding his partner and another person “in such a\\n\\nposition as to indicate with reasonable certainty, to a rational mind,\\n\\nthat they had just” committed an adulterous act. Id. Moreover,\\n\\nalthough words alone are almost never sufficiently provoking, words\\n\\nthat disclose an adulterous act of a partner can be. See Lynn v. State,\\n\\n296 Ga. 109, 111 (2) (765 SE2d 322) (2014). That is because words\\n\\nthat disclose the adulterous conduct of a partner are “not just words,\\n\\nat least to the extent that they cause the accused to genuinely and\\n\\nreasonably believe that his spouse has been unfaithful.” Id.; see also\\n\\nWare v. State, 303 Ga. 847, 850 (III) (815 SE2d 837) (2018) (“[I]n\\n\\norder for the conduct communicated by such words to amount to the\\n\\n\\n\\nsuch as to reduce the offense from murder to manslaughter, but the facts\\noutlined in the opinion did not conclusively show that the wife and the\\ndeceased had just committed adultery, although a person in the defendant’s\\nposition reasonably could have concluded they did. And the opinion noted that\\nthere were “circumstances indicating that the defendant” knew his wife was a\\n“lewd” woman, even though the defendant specifically disclaimed suspecting\\nhis wife of adultery. See id. at 400-401 (noting that after he was arrested, the\\ndefendant gave a statement in which he “denied that he ever had any reason\\nto suspect his wife”). Those circumstances in Mays do not undercut the\\nnecessity of a voluntary manslaughter charge here. Allen did not catch Tia and\\nSmith in an adulterous act, nor did he say (similar to the defendant in Mays)\\nthat he suspected that Tia was committing adultery. But the circumstances\\nhere, like those in Mays, would allow a reasonable person to conclude that Tia\\nhad committed an adulterous act.\\n                                      17\\n sort of provocation necessary to reduce a murder to manslaughter,\\n\\nthey must disclose adulterous conduct or, in the case of unmarried\\n\\npersons, sexual relations with other persons during the course of a\\n\\nrelationship” (citations and punctuation omitted; emphasis added));\\n\\nStrickland v. State, 257 Ga. 230, 231-232 (2) (357 SE2d 85) (1987)\\n\\n(“[A]lthough the victim used words to make the defendant aware of\\n\\nher adultery, it was the victim’s adulterous conduct, rather than her\\n\\nwords describing that conduct, which served as sufficient\\n\\nprovocation authorizing a charge on voluntary manslaughter.”);\\n\\nWayne R. LaFave & Austin W. Scott, Jr., Handbook on Criminal\\n\\nLaw § 76, 575-577 (1972) (noting rule in some jurisdictions that find\\n\\nprovocation when “words are informational,” in that they are\\n\\n“conveying information of a fact which constitutes a reasonable\\n\\nprovocation when that fact is observed[,]” and noting, “[t]he modern\\n\\ntendency is to extend the rule of mitigation beyond the narrow\\n\\nsituation where one spouse actually catches the other in the act of\\n\\ncommitting adultery. Thus, it has been held that a reasonable\\n\\nthough erroneous belief on the part of the husband that his wife is\\n\\n                                 18\\n committing adultery will do.”).8 To recap then, what this consistent\\n\\nprecedent shows is that a defendant’s discovery of a partner’s sexual\\n\\ninfidelity can be the sort of provocation necessary to authorize a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter charge. Sometimes that discovery may be a\\n\\npersonal, first-hand observation of catching one’s partner in the act;\\n\\nother times, it may be from being told about the infidelity after the\\n\\nfact.\\n\\n        Applying those principles here, it is plain that there was at\\n\\nleast slight evidence to authorize a jury charge on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. Both Tia and Allen testified that Allen suspected Tia\\n\\nof having an affair with Smith, Allen’s cousin. Allen described in a\\n\\npolice interview that he became aware of the possible affair after\\n\\nsomeone called to ask if he was “okay” and if he and Tia were “okay”\\n\\nbecause Tia was seen with Smith in a car. Although it is not clear\\n\\n\\n\\n        8 The dissent argues that our decision today makes Georgia an outlier\\n\\namong our sister states. This is wrong for at least two reasons. First, LaFave’s\\nexplanation of the rule in at least some jurisdictions is consistent with our\\nholding. Second, our holding today does not change anything about Georgia\\nlaw; it is simply a faithful application of our precedent. Instead, it is the dissent\\nthat seeks to reinterpret Georgia law to narrow the application of the voluntary\\nmanslaughter statute.\\n                                         19\\n what Allen was told about that incident, Allen stated that he\\n\\nconfronted Tia about what he had heard in January and told her\\n\\nthat they should go their separate ways if she really were “messin’\\n\\naround.” So whatever Allen had been told, his words indicated\\n\\nsuspicion that Tia was being unfaithful by “messin’ around” with\\n\\nSmith. 9\\n\\n      In March, after being told that Tia and Smith had been caught\\n\\ntogether in a car, and being told by Tia that nothing was going on in\\n\\nresponse to Allen asking whether she were “messin’ around,” Allen\\n\\nfound Tia and Smith in what he could have reasonably perceived as\\n\\na compromising situation. 10 Smith was leaving Tia’s car that was\\n\\n\\n\\n      9  The dissent downplays the significance of this January encounter,\\nsuggesting that Tia and Smith were merely in a car together with another\\nfemale. Although there is no clear evidence of what Tia and Smith were doing\\nin the car, whoever saw Tia and Smith was so concerned by what they saw that\\nthey called Allen to see if everything was “okay” between him and Tia.\\n       10 The dissent takes issue with our characterization of these\\n\\ncircumstances, but in arguing that such situations cannot support a reasonable\\ninference that a spouse has committed adultery, it cites State v. Cooley, 536\\nSE2d 666 (S.C. 2000), which supports a voluntary manslaughter charge here.\\nThere, the Supreme Court of South Carolina stated that a killer can get a\\nvoluntary manslaughter charge if he “finds the other spouse and paramour in\\na guilty embrace or flagrantly suggestive situation.” Id. at 668 (emphasis\\nadded). Euphemisms aside, when a defendant may have killed another person\\n\\n                                     20\\n parked behind the gas station in the middle of the night when she\\n\\nwas expected to be on her way to work. A reasonable person could\\n\\ninfer that Tia and Smith were meeting this way in order to avoid\\n\\ndetection about their rendezvous. There is no evidence that Allen\\n\\nsaw Tia and Smith committing an adulterous act, but Allen testified\\n\\nthat he saw Smith getting out of Tia’s car and that Tia had an\\n\\nexpression on her face “like, damn, I’ve been caught.” Allen surmised\\n\\nthat Tia had in fact been unfaithful, stating, “I’m like two and two\\n\\ntogether like this, uh, so it’s really true.”\\n\\n     For his part, in response to Allen’s questions about why Smith\\n\\nas a married man was interfering with Allen’s marriage, Smith\\n\\n“smirked” and repeated “man, f**k you” while confirming that\\n\\n“something was going on” between him and Tia. In isolation, these\\n\\nwords may not signal an affair. But context matters. Allen stated\\n\\nthat Smith said those words after Allen kept pressing him for details\\n\\nin an attempt to understand why Smith and Tia were having an\\n\\n\\nbecause of sexual infidelity, the critical factor in determining whether a\\nvoluntary manslaughter instruction was warranted is whether the defendant\\nacted based on that discovery.\\n                                    21\\n affair. It cannot reasonably be denied that Smith’s response can be,\\n\\nthough is not required to be, interpreted as an admission that he\\n\\nand Tia had engaged in adulterous conduct. While this evidence may\\n\\nnot have been indisputable proof, a reasonable person could have\\n\\nfound that it amounted to a reasonable belief that such conduct had\\n\\noccurred.\\n\\n     Again, it is important to remember what the law requires. The\\n\\ndiscovery of adulterous conduct can provide the necessary\\n\\nprovocation to warrant a voluntary manslaughter charge. See Ware,\\n\\n303 Ga. at 850 (III) (disclosure of “adulterous conduct” may\\n\\nconstitute the serious provocation sufficient to require a jury charge\\n\\non voluntary manslaughter). This is not to say that a jury should or\\n\\nwould find Allen guilty of voluntary manslaughter, only that it is for\\n\\na properly charged jury to make that decision.\\n\\n     Our decision in Clough v. State, 298 Ga. 594 (783 SE2d 637)\\n\\n(2016) makes that abundantly clear. There, the defendant broke into\\n\\nhis mother-in-law’s house, went to a back bedroom, found his\\n\\nestranged wife and the victim sleeping, and stabbed the victim while\\n\\n                                 22\\n yelling “[t]his is what you get for f**king somebody’s wife.” Id. at\\n\\n594-595. There was no evidence that the wife and victim were in a\\n\\nstate of undress or otherwise had just engaged in adulterous\\n\\nconduct; indeed, the defendant found them sleeping. Id. But the\\n\\ncircumstances of them together were such that a defendant could\\n\\nhave reasonably believed that his wife and the victim had engaged\\n\\nin adulterous conduct. We noted, moreover, that whatever\\n\\ntranspired prior to the killing of the victim — including the\\n\\ndefendant’s possible prior knowledge that his estranged wife was\\n\\nhaving an affair, his possible prior knowledge of the victim’s\\n\\nidentity, and his willingness to unlawfully enter his mother-in-law’s\\n\\nhouse — all went to the sufficiency of the provocation that would\\n\\nexcite a reasonable person. See id. at 597 (2). What Clough makes\\n\\nclear is that “[w]hen there is evidence of alleged provocation, the\\n\\nsufficiency of the provocation is generally for the jury to weigh and\\n\\ndecide, not the trial court.” Id. (emphasis added); see also Lawson v.\\n\\nState, 280 Ga. 881, 882 (1) (635 SE2d 134) (2006) (concluding that\\n\\nthe evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find the defendant\\n\\n                                 23\\n guilty of voluntary manslaughter where it showed that the victim\\n\\nand his wife had a “stormy relationship and had separated\\n\\nintermittently,” the defendant had approached the victim’s wife\\n\\nabout having a relationship, the victim’s return to the residence\\n\\nangered the defendant, the defendant threatened to kill the victim\\n\\nif he did not leave, the victim left but returned several minutes later,\\n\\nand the defendant shot and killed the victim upon his return);\\n\\nRichardson v. State, 189 Ga. 448, 448-449 (1)-(3) (5 SE2d 891) (1939)\\n\\n(trial court erred in failing to charge on voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nwhere the jury would have been authorized to find the defendant\\n\\nguilty of that crime when the evidence showed that “on the night of\\n\\nthe homicide the deceased put her [baby] down by the side of an\\n\\nalley, went into a vacant lot with the husband of the defendant, and\\n\\nlay on the ground with him behind some bushes, and that the\\n\\ndefendant immediately thereafter came upon them and assaulted\\n\\nand killed the deceased”).11\\n\\n\\n      11 At several points, the dissent distinguishes some of our cases by noting\\n\\nthat they addressed the sufficiency of the evidence. But this misses the point.\\n\\n                                       24\\n       The State and the dissent make several arguments that a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter charge was unwarranted here. But these\\n\\nall fail. Citing Tepanca v. State, 297 Ga. 47 (771 SE2d 879) (2015),\\n\\nthe State first argues that there was no evidence that Allen knew of\\n\\na sexual relationship between Tia and Smith and that any claim of\\n\\nsexual jealousy would be based “wholly on supposition.” But\\n\\nTepanca does not apply. There, the defendant killed the victim, who\\n\\noften drove the defendant’s paramour to work. Id. at 47 (1). The\\n\\ndefendant argued on appeal that he was entitled to a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter instruction, but we rejected the claim because there\\n\\nwas no evidence that the victim and the defendant’s paramour were\\n\\nsexually involved. Id. at 49-50 (4). We assumed in that case that\\n\\n“even if” the defendant’s former lover told the defendant that she\\n\\nhad “gone out with” the victim (which by itself would not show any\\n\\nadulterous conduct), the defendant still would not be entitled to a\\n\\n\\n\\nA case holding that certain evidence is sufficient to support a voluntary\\nmanslaughter conviction necessarily means that the same evidence would\\nrequire a jury charge. Surely the dissent is not arguing that the standard for\\ngetting a voluntary manslaughter charge is higher than the standard for\\nobtaining a voluntary manslaughter conviction.\\n                                     25\\n voluntary manslaughter charge because there was no evidence that\\n\\nhe killed the victim as the result of a sudden, violent, and irresistible\\n\\npassion. Id. at 50 (4). In contrast, here there was more than slight\\n\\nevidence showing that Allen acted out of a passionate response to\\n\\nthe sudden disclosure of sexual infidelity.\\n\\n     The State next argues that a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ninstruction was not warranted because Allen repeatedly claimed in\\n\\nhis trial testimony that he was acting in self-defense and did not\\n\\nintend to kill Smith, which the State argues conflicted with a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter claim. We have made clear that intent is\\n\\nnecessary for a defendant to be convicted of voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nas an alternative to malice murder. See Carter v. State, 298 Ga. 867,\\n\\n870 (785 SE2d 274) (2016). But contrary to the State’s argument, a\\n\\ndefendant’s claim of self-defense does not preclude an alternative\\n\\nclaim of voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n     In support of its argument, the State cites Ruffin v. State, 296\\n\\nGa. 262 (765 SE2d 913) (2014), where this Court stated that\\n\\n“appellant’s own testimony contradict[ed] a necessary element of\\n\\n                                   26\\n voluntary manslaughter, in that he claim[ed] he did not intend to\\n\\nkill, but was acting in self-defense[.]” Id. at 264 (2) (b). But unlike\\n\\nthis case, there was nothing else in Ruffin that would have\\n\\nsupported a voluntary manslaughter charge. Our recitation of the\\n\\nfacts there did not show even slight evidence of provocation; instead,\\n\\nit showed that the killing was likely premeditated. Id. at 262-263.\\n\\nSee also Davis v. State, 312 Ga. 870, 874 (2) (866 SE2d 390) (2021)\\n\\n(“Neither fear that someone is going to pull a [weapon] nor fighting\\n\\nare the    types   of   provocation    which   demand     a   voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge.” (citation and punctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     Although the State argues that Allen testified that he acted in\\n\\nself-defense and did not have an intent to kill, it also points out that\\n\\nthe video recording of the killing here “fundamentally undermines”\\n\\nAllen’s self-defense claim without explaining why the same evidence\\n\\nwould not undercut his testimony about his intent. Indeed, a jury\\n\\nwould have been authorized to conclude from the brutality of the\\n\\nbeating, as displayed in the uncontroverted video recording, that\\n\\nAllen had an intent to kill. See Burley v. State, 316 Ga. 796, 806 (888\\n\\n                                  27\\n SE2d 507) (2023) (“Intent to kill may be inferred from the nature of\\n\\nthe instrument used in making the assault, the manner of its use,\\n\\nand the nature of the wounds inflicted, as well as the brutality and\\n\\nduration of the assault.” (citation and punctuation omitted)). Such\\n\\nan intent is necessary for a defendant to be convicted of voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter as an alternative to malice murder. See Carter v.\\n\\nState, 298 Ga. 867, 870 (785 SE2d 274) (2016) (“[A] defendant must\\n\\nhave an intent to kill in order” to be convicted of voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter instead of malice murder).\\n\\n     To the extent the State reads Ruffin as precluding jury charges\\n\\non inconsistent theories, any such reading has been superseded by\\n\\nmore recent caselaw. See McClure v. State, 306 Ga. 856, 864 (1) &\\n\\nn.17 (834 SE2d 96) (2019) (a “defendant is entitled to a requested\\n\\njury instruction regarding an affirmative defense when at least\\n\\nslight evidence” supports that theory, “regardless of whether th[at]\\n\\ntheory . . . conflicts with any other theory being advanced by the\\n\\ndefendant”). We have made clear recently that regardless of whether\\n\\na defendant’s theories conflict, “[i]f there is some evidence to support\\n\\n                                  28\\n more than one theory, a defendant who pursues alternative defense\\n\\ntheories is entitled to requested charges on both theories.” Gaston v.\\n\\nState, 307 Ga. 634, 637 (2) (a) (837 SE2d 808) (2020) (citations and\\n\\npunctuation omitted); see also McClure, 306 Ga. at 860 (1)\\n\\n(“Criminal defendants, like other litigants, are entitled to pursue\\n\\nalternative theories, even when those theories are inconsistent.”);\\n\\nGregoroff v. State, 248 Ga. 667, 670 (285 SE2d 537) (1982) (“[T]he\\n\\ngeneral rule [is] that an accused is permitted to interpose\\n\\ninconsistent defenses in a criminal case.” (footnote omitted)).\\n\\n     As discussed above, there was at least slight evidence of\\n\\nprovocation to support a voluntary manslaughter claim, so the court\\n\\nwas required to give the instruction despite Allen’s main theory that\\n\\nhe   acted in self-defense. Whether the evidence regarding\\n\\nprovocation is persuasive is not for the trial court, or this Court, to\\n\\nsay in determining whether a voluntary manslaughter charge was\\n\\nwarranted. That determination may be made only by a properly\\n\\ncharged jury. Because the trial court refused to allow the jury to\\n\\nmake that determination, it erred.\\n\\n                                  29\\n      The dissent reaches a contrary conclusion, but does so\\n\\nengaging with only a subset of the relevant precedent, framing facts\\n\\nand context only in a light favorable to a theory of guilt of murder,\\n\\nand becoming distracted by “practical and concerning” policy\\n\\nimplications of our voluntary manslaughter statute’s requirement\\n\\nthat juries decide some important questions. First, the dissent\\n\\ncontends    that   judges     must    be    the   gatekeepers      to   keep\\n\\nreasonableness questions away from the jury. But assessing what is\\n\\nreasonable, what reasonable inference can be drawn from the\\n\\nevidence, or more relevant here, whether certain qualifying conduct\\n\\nis sufficiently provocative is almost always a jury question. See\\n\\nAnderson v.

A properly\\n\\ninstructed jury could weigh all the evidence here and decide that the\\n\\nprovocation was insufficient. But that is not the question before us.\\n\\nWe are tasked with determining only whether there is slight\\n\\nevidence of provocation such that a jury instruction on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter had to be given.\\n\\n     The dissent reads our case law as requiring the defendant to\\n\\nhave caught his spouse or partner in the act of adultery or hear\\n\\nabout it in a taunting way, leaving no room for anything else. That\\n\\nis simply not the law. It is the disclosure or discovery of adulterous\\n\\nconduct that is required, and that element has been met here.\\n\\nSometimes discovery happens during the act; sometimes it happens\\n\\nlater. The dissent does not meaningfully engage with Clough, where\\n\\nthe defendant neither caught the defendant in an adulterous act —\\n\\nthe victim was merely sleeping in the same bedroom with another\\n\\n\\n                                 32\\n man — nor was there evidence that he had heard about any such\\n\\nconduct. 298 Ga. at 595. Indeed, in concluding that there was slight\\n\\nevidence of serious provocation, we noted that the defendant’s\\n\\npossible knowledge of the affair went to the sufficiency of the\\n\\nprovocation, which was an issue for the jury to resolve. Id. at 597 (2).\\n\\n      The dissent acknowledges our case law indicating that\\n\\nalthough words by themselves generally do not serve as sufficient\\n\\nprovocation, words disclosing adulterous conduct can.13 See\\n\\nStrickland, 257 Ga. at 231 (2) (“[A]lthough the victim used words to\\n\\nmake the defendant aware of her adultery, it was the victim’s\\n\\nadulterous conduct, rather than her words describing that conduct,\\n\\nwhich served as sufficient provocation authorizing a charge on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter.”). Indeed, it seeks to apply this exception\\n\\nto rule that words by themselves are not generally seriously\\n\\n\\n\\n      13 The dissent makes another misstatement of the law that there is a\\n\\n“single, narrow” exception to the words-alone rule, concluding that it can only\\nbe for words disclosing adultery. But our precedent holds otherwise. See, e.g.,\\nScott v. State, 291 Ga. 156, 157-158 (2) (728 SE2d 238) (2012) (concluding that\\nthe defendant’s discovery that his niece was being molested by the victim,\\nalong with defendant’s taunting were sufficient to warrant voluntary\\nmanslaughter instruction).\\n                                      33\\n provoking. The dissent suggests that such disclosures must be of a\\n\\n“taunting” nature. Even if that proposition were true,14 there is some\\n\\nevidence of taunting here. In particular, there is evidence that Smith\\n\\n\\n      14 Our case law has recognized that words disclosing adulterous conduct\\n\\ncan be sufficient provocation and has distinguished cases concluding that no\\nvoluntary manslaughter charge was required or that the charge given was\\nadequate on the basis that no disclosure of adulterous conduct had occurred,\\nnot that words can never play a role in supporting a voluntary manslaughter\\ninstruction. In Ware, after reaffirming the general principle that words\\ndisclosing adulterous conduct can be serious provocation, we distinguished\\ncases on the basis that they involved “statements by a victim that she wants\\nto end the relationship, is involved with or prefers the affections of another, or\\neven has chosen to leave the defendant for another — but that stop[ped] short\\nof disclosing extra-relationship sexual conduct[.]” 303 Ga. at 850-851 (III).\\nWare distinguished those cases because they did not involve any taunting or\\nbragging about adulterous conduct; indeed, many did not involve any\\ndisclosures that immediately preceded the killing. See, e.g., Brown v. State,\\n294 Ga. 677, 680-681 (3) (755 SE2d 699) (2018) (“[T]here [was] no evidence that\\n[the victim] had recently engaged in sexual relations with her out-of-state\\nhusband or that she taunted [the defendant] with such conduct.”); Mack v.\\nState, 272 Ga. 415, 417-418 (2) (529 SE2d 132) (2000) (“[T]here was no evidence\\nthat appellant’s homicidal acts were preceded by the victim verbally taunting\\nappellant with her adulterous conduct.”); Mayweather v. State, 254 Ga. 660,\\n661 (3) (333 SE2d 597) (1985) (concluding that “victim’s alleged statement that\\nshe was out with another man” was not sufficient provocation).\\n       But at least one case cited in Ware is somewhat anomalous. In Davis v.\\nState, we observed that “there [was] no evidence the victim recounted her\\nadulterous conduct to Appellant or taunted him with descriptions thereof.” 290\\nGa. 421, 424 (2) (721 SE2d 886) (2012). But then we suggested that there was,\\nstating: “In, fact the only evidence that the victim even committed adultery\\nwas that Appellant told [his ex-wife] that his wife admitted to an affair.” Id.\\nDavis’s ultimate conclusion that the court did not err in charging that words\\nalone were insufficient provocation to support a verdict of manslaughter was\\ngrounded in its observation “there was no evidence of any sort of taunting by\\nthe victim with adulterous conduct[.]” Id. And as described above, there is at\\nleast slight evidence of taunting here.\\n                                       34\\n smirked at Allen when stating that there was “something going on”\\n\\nbetween Smith and Tia. This may not be the strongest or most\\n\\ncompelling evidence, but again, only slight evidence is required for\\n\\na jury instruction to be warranted.\\n\\n     The dissent oversimplifies its recitation of the factual basis of\\n\\nthe deadly encounter and views the evidence only in the light most\\n\\nfavorable to its conclusion. It does not look at the evidence\\n\\nreasonably as a whole. Instead, it focuses on whether Allen’s\\n\\nresponse to the situation was reasonable. But this question is for the\\n\\njury, not judges, to decide.\\n\\n     The dissent fundamentally misunderstands this point. We are\\n\\nnot holding, as the dissent would suggest, that judges must give a\\n\\nvoluntary   manslaughter       charge   any   time   someone   claims\\n\\nprovocation. Under our decision today, our current legal framework\\n\\nwould still keep judges in their gatekeeping role, deciding whether\\n\\nthe alleged provocation is of the type that our case law has concluded\\n\\nis “sufficient to excite” the “passion in a reasonable person[.]” OCGA\\n\\n§ 16-5-2 (a). And as this opinion makes clear, the discovery of a\\n\\n                                  35\\n partner’s adulterous conduct — whether in the act or through a\\n\\nverbal disclosure — is the prototypical type of provocation that can\\n\\nexcite the passions of a reasonable person.15 But our legal framework\\n\\nmakes clear that once a trial court performs its gatekeeping function\\n\\nin determining whether there is slight evidence of serious\\n\\nprovocation, it is ultimately up to the jury to decide whether that\\n\\nprovocation was actually sufficient to excite a sudden, violent, and\\n\\nirresistible passion in a reasonable person. See Anderson, 248 Ga. at\\n\\n683 (3); see also Peter Westen & Frank G. Millard, Individualizing\\n\\nthe Reasonable Person in Criminal Law, 2 Crim. L. & Phil. 137, 156\\n\\n(2008) (“The reason the law delegates final authority to jurors to\\n\\nmake policy decisions to mitigate murder to manslaughter is\\n\\nprecisely because the law believes that jurors, who are drawn at\\n\\nrandom from the community, are better equipped than judges to\\n\\nmake such policy decisions.”); Kit Kinports, Criminal Procedure in\\n\\n\\n     15 Discovery of adulterous conduct is not the only type of provocation that\\n\\ncan constitute “serious provocation” under OCGA § 16-5-2 (a). See, e.g.,\\nWilliams v. State, 309 Ga. 212, 217 (2) (845 SE2d 573) (2020) (noting that a\\njury could find a defendant engaged in mutual combat was guilty of voluntary\\nmanslaughter rather than murder).\\n                                      36\\n Perspective, 98 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 71, 131 (2007) (“[T]he\\n\\nconcept of objective reasonableness is utilized both to reflect\\n\\ncommunity values and to enforce uniform standards of behavior.”\\n\\n(footnote omitted)); Dolres A. Donovan & Stephanie M. Wildman, Is\\n\\nthe Reasonable Man Obsolete?: A Critical Perspective on Self-Defense\\n\\nand Provocation, 14 Loy. L. A. L. Rev. 435, 448 (1981) (“[W]hen it\\n\\nwas first introduced into the law of provocation, the reasonable man\\n\\ntest was a device for delivering to the jury, in its role as the\\n\\nconscience of the community, the normative or value judgment as to\\n\\nthe degree of moral culpability to be assigned to the particular\\n\\noffender.”).16\\n\\n\\n\\n      16 The dissent rejects the notion that juries are to determine whether a\\n\\nprovocation was reasonable or sufficient to reduce the offense from murder to\\nvoluntary manslaughter because the text of OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) suggests that\\njuries are to assess only whether “an interval between the provocation and the\\nkilling” is “sufficient for the voice of reason and humanity to be heard[.]” But\\nmany defenses or claims of mitigation are properly left for the jury to resolve\\nwithout express statutory language saying so. See, e.g., OCGA §§ 16-3-2 (a) (“A\\nperson shall not be found guilty of a crime if, at the time of the act, omission,\\nor negligence constituting the crime, the person did not have mental capacity\\nto distinguish between right and wrong in relation to such act, omission, or\\nnegligence.”); 16-3-4 (a) (“A person shall not be found guilty of a crime when,\\nat the time of the act, omission, or negligence constituting the crime, the\\nperson, because of involuntary intoxication, did not have sufficient mental\\n\\n                                       37\\n       The dissent goes on to offer a parade of horribles that will flow\\n\\nfrom today’s decision. But none of those horribles follow from\\n\\nproperly instructing a jury. Georgia law trusts juries. So should the\\n\\ndissent.\\n\\n      And, in any event, even if a jury were to convict someone of\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter in a case where we think murder would\\n\\nhave been more appropriate, a voluntary manslaughter conviction\\n\\nis not an acquittal. It is a felony that carries a potential sentence of\\n\\n20 years in prison (and any lesser sentence would be up to the judge,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncapacity to distinguish between right and wrong in relation to such act.”); 16-\\n3-21 (a) (“A person is justified in threatening or using force against another\\nwhen and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that such threat or\\nforce is necessary to defend himself or herself or a third person against such\\nother’s imminent use of unlawful force; however, except as provided in Code\\nSection 16-3-23, a person is justified in using force which is intended or likely\\nto cause death or great bodily harm only if he or she reasonably believes that\\nsuch force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury to himself or\\nherself or a third person or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.”); 16-\\n3-23 (“A person is justified in threatening or using force against another when\\nand to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that such threat or force\\nis necessary to prevent or terminate such other’s unlawful entry into or attack\\nupon a habitation; however, such person is justified in the use of force which is\\nintended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only” under certain\\nenumerated circumstances).\\n                                        38\\n not the jury). 20 years in prison is a serious sentence for a serious\\n\\ncrime.\\n\\n     In sum, our decision today rests on solid footing based on\\n\\nexisting legal precedent. Under that case law, the trial court’s\\n\\nrefusal to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter was\\n\\nerroneous.\\n\\n     3. The State argues that any error was harmless. We disagree.\\n\\n     “A nonconstitutional error is harmless if the State shows that\\n\\nit is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the\\n\\nverdict[.]” Smith v. State, 313 Ga. 584, 587 (872 SE2d 262) (2022)\\n\\n(citation and punctuation omitted). In conducting that analysis, “we\\n\\nassess the evidence from the viewpoint of reasonable jurors, not in\\n\\nthe light most favorable to the verdicts.” Hatney v. State, 308 Ga.\\n\\n438, 441 (2) (841 SE2d 702) (2020).\\n\\n     The State has not carried its burden. The State primarily relies\\n\\non the fact that Allen testified repeatedly that he was not angry but\\n\\nattacked Smith in self-defense after Smith hit him. Allen did testify\\n\\nthat he was not angry, but he also repeatedly said that he was. These\\n\\n                                 39\\n conflicts are for the jury to resolve, not this Court. And although\\n\\nAllen’s self-defense claim was inconsistent with his argument that\\n\\nhe was sufficiently provoked, Tia testified that Allen appeared to be\\n\\n“pretty angry” upon finding her and Smith and that Allen pounded\\n\\non her car. This all happened before any physical interaction with\\n\\nSmith. Moreover, the video recording shows a nearly unrelenting\\n\\nattack on Smith, which included multiple kicks to Smith’s head. A\\n\\njury could find that Allen’s actions as evidenced by the recording\\n\\nwere consistent with the type of anger or rage that usually\\n\\naccompanies the type of passion a provoked defendant may\\n\\nexperience and for which a voluntary manslaughter instruction is\\n\\nwarranted. See Williams v. State, 306 Ga. 717, 721 (2) (832 SE2d\\n\\n805) (2019) (noting that voluntary manslaughter requires that a\\n\\ndefendant “was so angered that he reacted passionately,” not merely\\n\\nthat the defendant “was attempting to repel an attack” (cleaned up));\\n\\n2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 15.2 (a) (3d ed. Oct.\\n\\n2023 update) (noting that “[t]he ‘passion’ (emotional disturbance)\\n\\ninvolved in the crime of voluntary manslaughter is generally rage\\n\\n                                 40\\n (great anger)”).\\n\\n     As discussed above, the video recording is evidence of Allen’s\\n\\nintent to kill, which is an element present in both malice murder\\n\\nand voluntary manslaughter. In several cases, we have affirmed\\n\\nmalice murder convictions and concluded that the failure to charge\\n\\non voluntary manslaughter was harmless where there was strong\\n\\nevidence that the killing was premeditated or there was a long\\n\\ninterval between the provocation and the killing. See, e.g., Heyward\\n\\nv. State, 308 Ga. 570, 573 (2) (842 SE2d 293) (2020) (evidence that\\n\\none day before killing the victim, the defendant talked about killing\\n\\nthe victim and showed a weapon that matched the murder weapon,\\n\\nundercut the defendant’s claims that he took the gun from the victim\\n\\nduring the encounter and that he killed the victim in response to the\\n\\nvictim’s actions); Hatney, 308 Ga. at 441-442 (2) (concluding that\\n\\neven if the victim’s conduct towards the defendant was sufficiently\\n\\nprovocative, the failure to charge was harmless where: (1) there was\\n\\na significant period of time between the alleged provocation and the\\n\\nbeating of the victim — the defendant dressed and put on his boots\\n\\n                                 41\\n in preparation for the attack, knocked out the victim, tied his hands\\n\\nand feet, wrapped him in a sheet, and moved him to several rooms,\\n\\nincluding “up and down” steps before finally beating him to death;\\n\\nand (2) the defendant’s described motives for the attack showed\\n\\ndeliberation rather than irresistible passion).\\n\\n     But none of those circumstances are present here. There was\\n\\nno significant interval between the provocation and the initial\\n\\nattack on Smith. And the State presented no evidence supporting a\\n\\ntheory of premeditation. Allen’s reasons for being at the gas station\\n\\nand just happening to come upon Smith and Tia are difficult to\\n\\ncredit, but even a rejection of Allen’s explanation does not mean that\\n\\nhe premeditated finding and killing Allen. Instead, a jury could\\n\\nconclude from the evidence that Allen was suspicious of Tia and\\n\\nfollowed her there to confirm (or dispel) his suspicions and reacted\\n\\npassionately to the totality of what he discovered there.\\n\\n     To be sure, in his initial statements to police and in his trial\\n\\ntestimony, Allen did not provide a consistent story about his intent\\n\\nor about the level of anger he experienced as a result of seeing Tia\\n\\n                                 42\\n and Smith. The dissent does an excellent job pointing that out. If all\\n\\nwe had to go by were those statements and testimony, we might\\n\\nagree with the dissent that there was no harm here. But the video\\n\\nrecording also carries weight, perhaps more so because it presents\\n\\nirrefutable evidence. A jury would plainly be authorized to conclude\\n\\nfrom watching that recording that Allen was upset upon seeing Tia\\n\\nand Smith. He hit Tia’s car with his hand and then followed Smith.\\n\\nAnd as mentioned, it shows Allen’s rage as he mercilessly beat\\n\\nSmith.\\n\\n     The fact that Allen prioritized a self-defense claim does not\\n\\ndiminish the harm here. That defense was weak at best. The State\\n\\nacknowledges as much. The dissent cites then-Presiding Justice\\n\\nNahmias’s concurrence in McClure v. State, 306 Ga. 856 (834 SE2d\\n\\n96) (2019), for the idea that any failing to instruct on alternative\\n\\ndefenses is likely to be harmless. That argument misunderstands\\n\\nPresiding Justice Nahmias’s reasoning; in McClure, he explained\\n\\n     Presenting inconsistent defenses to the jury, particularly\\n     when the evidentiary support for one defense is\\n     considerably weaker than for others or where a defense is\\n\\n                                 43\\n       contradicted by the defendant’s own account of events,\\n      risks losing credibility for all of the defenses.\\n\\nId. at 866 (Nahmias, P.J., concurring) (emphasis in original). That\\n\\nreasoning applies only when there is a stronger defense already that\\n\\nthe new inconsistent defense would undermine. That is not this case;\\n\\nhere, the video recording of the incident is perhaps the strongest\\n\\npiece of evidence in this case, and that recording points far more\\n\\nstrongly to a claim of voluntary manslaughter than a self-defense\\n\\nclaim. The trial court removed from the jury’s consideration the\\n\\nstronger of Allen’s defenses, and we cannot say that this was\\n\\nharmless.17\\n\\n\\n\\n      17  One final point. The dissent notes that Allen rejected a pretrial\\nvoluntary manslaughter plea deal and, instead, focused at trial on self-defense\\nas main defense. The fact that Allen received a plea offer undermines the\\ndissent’s claim that no voluntary manslaughter charge was warranted,\\nbecause prosecutors must have a factual basis for the plea in order to secure a\\nconviction. See Oliver v. State, 308 Ga. 652, 654 (1) (842 SE2d 847) (2020)\\n(“Uniform Superior Court Rule 33.9 provides that a trial court, before entering\\na judgment upon a guilty plea, must make an inquiry on the record as may\\nsatisfy the trial court that there is a factual basis for the plea.” (citation and\\npunctuation omitted)). In any event, this fact is irrelevant to a harmlessness\\nanalysis because we must “assess the evidence from the viewpoint of\\nreasonable jurors” to determine “whether it is highly probable that the error\\ndid not contribute to the verdict.” There is no indication the jury heard evidence\\nthat Allen rejected the plea offer.\\n\\n                                       44\\n       In sum, there is evidence of what is universally considered\\n\\nserious provocation. Although there is very strong evidence that\\n\\nAllen intended to kill Smith, this evidence does not answer the\\n\\nquestion of whether that intent was the result of serious provocation\\n\\nsuch that he could be found guilty of the lesser offense of voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. On this record, the State has failed to establish that\\n\\nit is highly probable that not a single juror would have found Allen\\n\\nguilty of voluntary manslaughter. Therefore, it cannot show that it\\n\\nis highly probable that the court’s error in failing to instruct the jury\\n\\non voluntary manslaughter did not contribute to the verdict.\\n\\nAccordingly, we reverse Allen’s malice murder conviction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Moreover, the fact that Allen rejected a plea deal shows nothing about\\nhis subjective assessment of the evidence, much less an objective one. The\\nrecord indicates that the plea offer was “20 years to serve” for voluntary\\nmanslaughter. Although this is less than the maximum sentence for a murder\\nconviction, it is the maximum sentence for voluntary manslaughter. See OCGA\\n§§ 16-5-1 (e) (1) (“A person convicted of the offense of murder shall be punished\\nby death, by imprisonment for life without parole, or by imprisonment for\\nlife.”), 16-5-2 (b) (voluntary manslaughter conviction shall be “punished by\\nimprisonment for not less than one nor more than 20 years”). Allen’s rejection\\nof the plea more likely reflects his decision to take his chances at trial and\\npossibly obtain an acquittal rather than face the certainty of a lengthy\\nimprisonment.\\n\\n                                       45\\n      Because the malice murder conviction is now reversed, the\\n\\nfelony murder counts based on aggravated assault and aggravated\\n\\nbattery are no longer vacated as a matter of law. But the failure to\\n\\ngive the voluntary manslaughter charge also affects these counts\\n\\nunder the reasoning of Edge v. State, 261 Ga. 865, 865-867 (2) (414\\n\\nSE2d 463) (1992), so the verdicts on those counts cannot stand,\\n\\neither. See Clough, 298 Ga. at 597-598 (2) (after reversing murder\\n\\nconviction on failure to provide voluntary manslaughter charge,\\n\\nconcluding that unvacated convictions for felony murder based on\\n\\naggravated assault and burglary also had to be “reversed” under\\n\\nEdge). On remand, the State may retry Allen for malice murder and\\n\\nfelony murder, as the evidence was sufficient as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process to support a conviction on those counts.\\n\\nSee Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61\\n\\nLE2d 560) (1979)). The guilty verdicts on the other counts are not\\n\\naffected by a voluntary manslaughter charge, but the trial court may\\n\\nmerge or unmerge some of those counts depending on the disposition\\n\\nof the murder charges on remand. See id. at 598 (2).\\n\\n                                 46\\n      Judgment reversed. All the Justices concur, except Boggs, C.J.,\\n\\nand Ellington, LaGrua, and Colvin, JJ., who dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                47\\n       BETHEL, Justice, concurring.\\n\\n      I join the opinion of the Court because I believe it accurately\\n\\ngives effect to the directives of OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) (the voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter statute) and faithfully grapples with and applies our\\n\\nprecedent.18 Moreover, it has the added benefit of empowering\\n\\njuries, which seems to be the clear default of not only this statute\\n\\nbut Georgia law generally. I also note my agreement with the\\n\\ndissent that, in determining whether a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ninstruction is warranted, the trial court serves as a gatekeeper,\\n\\nassessing both the quality of the evidence — that is, if the jury\\n\\nshould be instructed to consider whether the defendant “act[ed]\\n\\nsolely as the result of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion”\\n\\nbased on the character of the alleged provocation, see OCGA § 16-5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      18 The dissent suggests that I have articulated a different standard than\\n\\nthe majority, though it does not explain this characterization. See Dissent at\\n___ n. 10. Contrary to this suggestion, I concur in full in the majority opinion\\nand do not endeavor to articulate a different standard than the majority.\\nRather, as explained below, my focus in writing separately is to attempt to\\nmake sense of our precedent in a way that more fully captures our voluntary\\nmanslaughter statute and its application.\\n                                      48\\n 2 — and the quantum of such evidence, see Maj. Op. at ____ (noting\\n\\nthat a defendant’s request for a jury charge on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter must be granted if supported by any evidence,\\n\\nhowever slight).\\n\\n     In evaluating the quality of the evidence at issue here, the\\n\\nmajority and the dissent, appropriately and understandably, turn to\\n\\nthe underlying case law in an effort to discern whether the evidence\\n\\nadduced in this case authorized a jury charge on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter. But it seems to me that this narrow focus comes at\\n\\nthe expense of the requirements actually imposed by OCGA § 16-5-\\n\\n2 (a), which speaks not in terms of infidelity but to the presence of a\\n\\n“sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious\\n\\nprovocation.” Thus, in my view, the work done by the majority and\\n\\nthe dissent reveals that the underlying case law not only is\\n\\ninconsistent and confused, but that the case law also fails to provide\\n\\nclear guidance to the bench, the bar, and the balance of Georgia’s\\n\\ncitizens. What follows is merely my attempt to make sense of what\\n\\nstrikes me as a woeful tangle of decisional law.\\n\\n                                  49\\n       Decisions applying the common law rule on infidelity leave me\\n\\nwith the strong impression that, as a historical matter, a defendant’s\\n\\ndiscovery of his or her intimate partner engaged in sexual congress\\n\\nwith another has been accepted as obviously, and perhaps\\n\\ninarguably, representative of the sort of provocation that could\\n\\noverwhelm a reasonable person’s senses such that a jury should be\\n\\ninstructed on voluntary manslaughter and, potentially, a finding of\\n\\na lower degree of culpability. 19 Indeed, at common law, the ancestor\\n\\nof our voluntary manslaughter statute, most cases appear to involve\\n\\nmarital infidelity. So it is no surprise that the common law rules\\n\\nwere generally couched in terms of the discovery or disclosure of\\n\\nmarital     infidelity.    In    determining       whether       a    voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge is appropriate, these “discovery in the act” fact\\n\\npatterns draw, I believe, the first line. For instance, if a defendant\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      19 I note that this historic view of the shock associated with the discovery\\n\\nof sexual infidelity may, for some, seem archaic and immaterial to the question\\nof reduced culpability for taking the life of another. Moreover, it seems patent\\nthat this understanding of voluntary manslaughter is deeply rooted in a time\\nand culture where wives were not considered equals or peers, but something\\nmore akin to property. But the wisdom of the rule is not at issue here.\\n                                       50\\n walks in on an event that could reasonably be understood as\\n\\ntantamount to discovering an intimate partner engaged in sexual\\n\\ncongress with another, it is well settled that such circumstances are\\n\\nsufficiently provocative in quality to warrant a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge. See, e.g., Richardson, 189 Ga. at 448-449 (1);\\n\\nClough, 298 Ga. at 594-595; Mays, 88 Ga. at 403.\\n\\n     These “discovery” cases then lead to “dramatic disclosure”\\n\\ncases. In those cases, the defendant does not actually find his or her\\n\\nintimate partner in the throes of intercourse or its equivalent, but\\n\\nnevertheless learns that such an act “just then” occurred or\\n\\npreviously occurred. The circumstances of such disclosure can be\\n\\nsufficiently shocking as to raise the question of whether a reasonable\\n\\nperson might be expected to have a passionate, emotional, and\\n\\nviolent response equal to the sort of response that would be evoked\\n\\nby the discovery of the act itself. See, e.g., Lynn, 296 Ga. at 111 (2);\\n\\nStrickland, 257 Ga. at 231-232 (2); Brooks v. State, 249 Ga. 583, 585-\\n\\n586 (292 SE2d 694) (1982).\\n\\n     Within these dramatic disclosure cases is where I find the\\n\\n                                  51\\n second line — and the one that applies in this case. As I understand\\n\\nit, where the totality of the evidence before the jury could support a\\n\\nfinding that a defendant, in the moments immediately preceding the\\n\\nviolence that led to a homicide, first learned that his or her partner\\n\\nhad been sexually unfaithful — or learned of a circumstance that\\n\\nwas of a similarly shocking and seriously provocative character—\\n\\nthen the defendant is entitled to have a jury determine whether any\\n\\nsudden, violent, and irresistible passion flowing from that serious\\n\\nprovocation was the sole cause of that defendant’s actions. 20 This\\n\\nunderstanding of the standard also strikes me as concordant with\\n\\ncases involving a shocking disclosure unrelated to sexual infidelity.\\n\\nSee, e.g., Scott v. State, 291 Ga. 156, 157-158 (2) (728 SE2d 238)\\n\\n(2012) (considering the “cumulative effect” of appellant’s niece\\n\\ndisclosing to him that the victim molested her, his sister’s refusal to\\n\\nbelieve her daughter, and the victim’s taunt regarding his\\n\\n\\n     20 Obviously, it would not be enough to merely suspect one’s intimate\\n\\npartner of infidelity or to observe the partner in innocuous, nonetheless\\nsuspicious, behavior with another. Rather, the circumstances must be\\nsufficiently serious to provoke a response on par with a shocking discovery or\\ndisclosure of sexual infidelity.\\n                                     52\\n molestation of the child, and concluding that such evidence\\n\\nsupported voluntary manslaughter charge).\\n\\n      In short, I think OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) authorizes a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter       charge      where     slight    evidence     shows      that,\\n\\nimmediately prior to the crimes, a defendant learned of shocking\\n\\nconduct — whether an act of infidelity or otherwise — and a jury\\n\\ncould conclude that the shock of that discovery could so overwhelm\\n\\na reasonable person that a lesser degree of culpability should be\\n\\nattached to his or her actions.21 Thus, in determining whether to\\n\\ninstruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, a trial court would be\\n\\n\\n\\n      21 I am flummoxed by the dissent’s suggestion that the majority and I\\n\\nhave articulated a standard that would require a voluntary manslaughter\\ncharge “in every domestic-violence related homicide case, regardless of\\nwhether the defendant said that he thought his partner had cheated on him\\njust before the killing occurred and even if the evidence clearly shows that she\\nhad not.” And I reject the characterization that either the majority or I have\\narticulated a standard that turns on whether a “defendant reasonably believed\\nthe deceased had at some point had sex with someone else.” A static belief that\\nyour intimate partner has “at some point had had sex with someone else” is\\nnot suggested as a basis for a charge. These are arguments against a standard\\nI don’t see articulated in the majority or this concurrence. Rather, the question\\nis clearly linked here and in the majority to the moments immediately\\nfollowing a shocking discovery or revelation. I’m simply not sure how to square\\nthis contention by the dissent. Either the defense can point to slight evidence\\nof a serious provocation, or it cannot. It would be a wild departure from our\\npractice to allow trial courts to withhold charges supported by slight evidence.\\n                                       53\\n wise to focus its analysis to the quality of the evidence — that is,\\n\\nwhether the provocation at issue is of such a quality as to warrant\\n\\nthe instruction — and beyond confirming that slight evidence exists,\\n\\nresist the temptation to assess the sufficiency of the alleged\\n\\nprovocation or the reasonableness of the defendant’s response to\\n\\nthat provocation. And in close cases like this one, it seems that it\\n\\nwould be prudent to err on the side of giving the requested\\n\\ninstruction.22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      22 While the dissent complains about the breadth of my reading of the\\n\\nlaw, it seems to me that the dissent’s reading of that same law is too narrow.\\nIndeed, the dissent’s position attempts to reshape our shocking disclosure\\nprecedent into merely another subset of sexual infidelity cases. But, it is not\\nmerely sexual infidelity or taunting about sexual infidelity that has been\\ndeemed sufficient to require a charge on voluntary manslaughter. See, e.g.,\\nScott, 291 Ga. at 157-158. The dissent’s reading of the caselaw does not appear\\nto account for that reality nor explain how its reading of the sexual infidelity\\ncases fits within a broader understanding of the statute as applied to other\\nfactual scenarios.\\n                                      54\\n      BOGGS, Chief Justice, dissenting.\\n\\n     The majority’s expanded theory of voluntary manslaughter in\\n\\nthe context of this domestic violence-related murder has never been\\n\\nthe law in Georgia. For over a century, our precedent in this context\\n\\nhas held that for the circumstances to cause a reasonable person to\\n\\nlose all self-control and thus warrant a charge on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter, the defendant must catch his significant other\\n\\nactually in the act of sexual relations or in circumstances\\n\\n“indicat[ing] with reasonable certainty to a rational mind” that\\n\\nsexual intercourse had “just then” occurred. Mays v. State, 88 Ga.\\n\\n399, 403-404 (14 SE 560) (1891). That standard is eviscerated under\\n\\nthe standard the majority applies today, where nearly every\\n\\ndefendant who kills a spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend (and that\\n\\nperson’s lover) in the future could have the jury charged on, and thus\\n\\nboth murders reduced to, voluntary manslaughter. That is true even\\n\\nif, as here, the defendant never says that he thought his partner had\\n\\n\\n                                 55\\n committed sexual infidelity just before the homicide occurred, and\\n\\nwhere there was direct evidence that the parties had not just\\n\\nengaged in such activity. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree\\n\\nthat this is a proper reading and application of our precedent, and\\n\\nbecause any instructional error here was also harmless in light of\\n\\nthe overwhelming evidence of guilt, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n     The facts, briefly, are as follows. Approximately two months\\n\\nbefore Appellant beat Treston Smith to death, Appellant heard that\\n\\nhis fiancée Tia and another woman had been in a car with Smith\\n\\nafter a party one night. Based on this rumor, Appellant confronted\\n\\nTia and said if she was “messin’ around,” they should go their\\n\\nseparate ways. Tia denied being with Smith. A few months later,\\n\\nAppellant stopped at a gas station, where tractor-trailers regularly\\n\\nparked, early one morning after work to adjust his rattling vehicle\\n\\nwindow. As he turned around behind the gas station, he saw Tia\\n\\nsitting fully clothed in the driver’s seat of her car during her normal\\n\\ncommute time. Smith, with his back turned and fully clothed, was a\\n\\nfew paces away from the car walking in the opposite direction.\\n\\n                                  56\\n Appellant hit Tia’s car window and cursed at her. Tia drove off\\n\\nwithout saying anything to Appellant. Appellant followed Smith,\\n\\nasking if something was “going on” between Tia and Smith. Smith\\n\\ncursed at Appellant, “smirked” at him, asked “what?”, and said that\\n\\n“something was going on between” Tia and Smith. Smith punched\\n\\nAppellant once; then Appellant beat and kicked Smith, left, and\\n\\nreturned to kick Smith in the head as Smith remained motionless\\n\\non the ground, ultimately killing him.\\n\\n     The majority’s view is that these circumstances reasonably\\n\\ncaused Appellant to believe that Tia had been unfaithful sometime\\n\\nin the past and that our law accepts that the disclosure of sexual\\n\\ninfidelity is serious provocation that would excite a sudden, violent,\\n\\nand irresistible passion in a reasonable person. The majority’s view\\n\\nis wrong. Our case law has long held that for sexual infidelity to\\n\\nwarrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction, a defendant must\\n\\nhave caught his partner in the act of sexual intercourse or in\\n\\ncircumstances “indicat[ing] with reasonable certainty to a rational\\n\\nmind” that his partner had “just then” had sex with someone else.\\n\\n                                 57\\n Mays, 88 Ga. at 403-404. This case law holds that mere words are\\n\\ninsufficient to support the giving of a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ninstruction, except when those words involve taunting related to\\n\\nsexual infidelity — a circumstance not present here.\\n\\n     1. The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n     A. What the controlling law is\\n\\n     OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) provides:\\n\\n     A person commits the offense of voluntary manslaughter\\n     when he causes the death of another human being under\\n     circumstances which would otherwise be murder and if he\\n     acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and\\n     irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation\\n     sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person;\\n     however, if there should have been an interval between\\n     the provocation and the killing sufficient for the voice of\\n     reason and humanity to be heard, of which the jury in all\\n     cases shall be the judge, the killing shall be attributed to\\n     deliberate revenge and be punished as murder.\\n\\nContrary    to   the   majority’s    interpretation,   the   voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter statute does not say that “the jury in all cases shall\\n\\nbe the judge” of the reasonableness of the killing of another person;\\n\\nit says that “the jury in all cases shall be the judge” of whether the\\n\\n                                    58\\n “interval” between the provocation and the homicide was “sufficient\\n\\nfor the voice of reason and humanity to be heard.” OCGA § 16-5-2\\n\\n(a). Otherwise, a trial court would be required to instruct on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter in virtually every domestic-violence related\\n\\nhomicide trial. This is not consistent with Georgia law.\\n\\n      The General Assembly has set forth the legal standard for\\n\\n“serious provocation” that may mitigate a killing to the lesser\\n\\noffense of voluntary manslaughter: “serious provocation” must be\\n\\n“sufficient to excite [a sudden, violent, and irresistible] passion in a\\n\\nreasonable person.” OCGA § 16-5-2 (a) (emphasis supplied). 23 In\\n\\nconstruing OCGA § 16-5-2 (a)’s language, we have consistently\\n\\nreiterated that “it is a question of law for the courts to determine\\n\\nwhether the defendant presented any evidence of sufficient\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      23 A person convicted of voluntary manslaughter may be sentenced to as\\n\\nlittle as one year imprisonment and to a maximum of twenty years\\nimprisonment, and, if sentenced to the maximum, may be considered for parole\\nafter serving thirteen years. See OCGA § 16-5-2 (a); OCGA § 42-9-40; Ga.\\nComp. R. & Regs., r. 475-3-.05 (10). Of course, murder is punishable by “death,\\n. . . imprisonment for life without parole, or . . . imprisonment for life,” OCGA\\n§ 16-5-1 (e) (1), and requires that a defendant serve a minimum of 30 years\\nbefore parole eligibility. See OCGA § 17-10-6.1 (c); OCGA § 42-9-39 (c).\\n                                       59\\n provocation to excite the passions of a reasonable person.”24 Ware v.\\n\\nState, 303 Ga. 847, 850 (815 SE2d 837) (2018) (cleaned up). See also\\n\\nWilkerson v. State, 317 Ga. 242, 247 (892 SE2d 737) (2023); Pace v.\\n\\nState, 258 Ga. 225, 225 (367 SE2d 803) (1988). Simply put, this is an\\n\\nobjective measure of the adequacy of the provocation or cause by\\n\\nreference to the ordinary or reasonable person and does not, as the\\n\\nmajority says, involve any question for the jury until a trial court\\n\\nhas determined that the provocation or cause is sufficient. That is\\n\\nthe sole question in this case, not, as the majority would have it, how\\n\\na jury would make a reasonableness determination once a jury has\\n\\nbeen charged on voluntary manslaughter. When a trial court makes\\n\\nthat legal determination, the question is whether a defendant’s\\n\\npassion under the circumstances is broadly characteristic of a\\n\\nreasonable person or merely idiosyncratically attributable to the\\n\\ndefendant. See Jivens v. State, 317 Ga. 859, 861-862 (896 SE2d 516)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      24  Applying this legal standard, as our case law requires, does not\\nevidence, as the majority suggests, a disregard for a foundational part of our\\njudicial system — the right to trial by jury. See U.S. Const. amend. VI; Ga.\\nConst. of 1983, Art. I, Sec. 1, Par. XI.\\n                                     60\\n (2023) (describing the objective voluntary manslaughter standard\\n\\nwhere “the reasonable person remains our barometer” and “we put\\n\\naside any peculiar response the defendant may have had” (cleaned\\n\\nup)). See also Annunziata v. State, 317 Ga. 175, 179 (891 SE2d 814)\\n\\n(2023) (explaining that serious provocation “is an objective standard,\\n\\nand we must evaluate the alleged provocation evidence with respect\\n\\nto its effect on a reasonable person, putting aside any peculiar\\n\\nresponse Appellant may have had” (cleaned up)). This objective\\n\\nstandard, which looks to the reactions of a reasonable person, is\\n\\nconsistent with the notion that in Georgia, a reasonable person is\\n\\nexpected to ordinarily control his emotions and not to react in a\\n\\nmurderous rage upon discovering one’s romantic partner in\\n\\ncircumstances that might raise mere suspicions about her\\n\\nfaithfulness. See Jivens, 317 Ga. at 862 (pointing out that “there is\\n\\na difference between slight evidence of serious provocation and\\n\\nevidence — even strong evidence — of lesser provocation”); Johnson\\n\\nv. State, 297 Ga. 839, 842 (778 SE2d 769) (2015) (“The voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter statute establishes an objective standard; the\\n\\n                                 61\\n provocation required to mitigate malice is that which would arouse\\n\\na heat of passion in a reasonable person, and it is of no moment\\n\\nwhether the provocation was sufficient to excite the deadly passion\\n\\nin the particular defendant.” (cleaned up; emphasis in original)). See\\n\\nalso 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 15.2 (b) (3d\\n\\ned. Oct. 2023 update) (“What is really meant by reasonable\\n\\nprovocation is provocation which causes a reasonable man to lose his\\n\\nnormal self-control; and, although a reasonable man who has thus\\n\\nlost control over himself would not kill, yet his homicidal reaction to\\n\\nthe provocation is at least understandable.” (cleaned up)).\\n\\n     In setting forth the legal standard of serious provocation in the\\n\\ncontext of adultery, we have long held that\\n\\n     in order to reduce the crime from murder to\\n     manslaughter, it is necessary it should be shown that the\\n     prisoner found the deceased in the very act of adultery\\n     with his wife. I do not mean to say that the prisoner must\\n     stand by and witness the actual copulative conjunction\\n     between the guilty parties. If the prisoner saw the\\n     deceased in bed with the wife, or saw him leaving the bed\\n     of the wife, or if he found them together in such a position\\n     as to indicate with reasonable certainty to a rational mind\\n     that they had just then committed the adulterous act, it\\n     will be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the law in\\n\\n                                  62\\n      this regard[.]\\n\\nMays, 88 Ga. at 403 (cleaned up; emphasis supplied) (affirming\\n\\nconviction for voluntary manslaughter where the defendant, upon\\n\\ncoming home one night, looked through a window, saw a naked man\\n\\nstep out of a bedroom in the defendant’s home, and fatally shot the\\n\\nman). See also Baker v. State, 111 Ga. 141, 142-143 (36 SE 607)\\n\\n(1900) (applying Mays’s standard to hold that no voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter instruction was warranted, because the defendant\\n\\ndid not find “his wife in the very act of adultery, or under such\\n\\ncircumstances as to indicate that she had just committed the\\n\\nadulterous act”). Mere suspicion or disclosure of past adultery is not\\n\\nenough, and the majority fails to explain why the mountain of case\\n\\nlaw contrary to its holding does not control the outcome here. See,\\n\\ne.g., Tepanca v. State, 297 Ga. 47, 49-50 (771 SE2d 879) (2015)\\n\\n(holding that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury\\n\\non voluntary manslaughter, because as a matter of law the\\n\\ndefendant’s “sexual jealousy was based wholly on supposition”);\\n\\nParks v. State, 234 Ga. 579, 581-582 (216 SE2d 804) (1975) (holding\\n\\n                                   63\\n that the defendant finding his ex-girlfriend sitting on a sofa with a\\n\\nman in her apartment was “not evidence of anything approaching\\n\\nsufficient passion or provocation to warrant a charge on the law of\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter”); Ware, 303 Ga. at 850-851 (holding that\\n\\n“statements by a victim that she wants to end the relationship, is\\n\\ninvolved with or prefers the affections of another, or even has chosen\\n\\nto leave the defendant for another — but that stop short of disclosing\\n\\nextra-relationship sexual conduct — have never been deemed” to be\\n\\nserious   provocation    to   require    a    voluntary   manslaughter\\n\\ninstruction).\\n\\n     Additionally,   words    alone     are   generally   not   seriously\\n\\nprovocative. See Rountree v. State, 316 Ga. 691, 694-695 (889 SE2d\\n\\n803) (2023). See also Mack v. State, 272 Ga. 415, 416, 418 (529 SE2d\\n\\n132) (2000) (holding that the trial court did not err in instructing the\\n\\njury that words alone could not be serious provocation where,\\n\\n“according to [the defendant’s] tape-recorded statement, the victim\\n\\ncalled him names, cursed him, laughed at him, and derided his\\n\\nphysique” by “comparing the size of his penis unfavorably with that\\n\\n                                  64\\n of another man,” “but there was no evidence that the victim had\\n\\nrecounted her sexual involvement with other persons, or that she\\n\\nbragged about her sexual activities with another gentleman”\\n\\n(cleaned up)). And although there is a single, narrow exception to\\n\\nthe words-alone rule, it does not apply here. See Ware, 303 Ga. at\\n\\n849-850 (explaining that “we have recognized . . . a limited exception\\n\\nto this rule for words informing a defendant of adulterous conduct.\\n\\nIn that one circumstance, we have held that words alone may\\n\\nconstitute . . . serious provocation . . . . But as those cases and other\\n\\ndecisions of this Court have made clear, in order for the conduct\\n\\ncommunicated by such words [alone] to amount to the sort of\\n\\nprovocation necessary to reduce a murder to manslaughter, they\\n\\nmust     disclose    adulterous      conduct”     (cleaned     up;    emphasis\\n\\nsupplied)).25 For example, in Ware, we held that the defendant was\\n\\n\\n\\n       25 Scott v. State, 291 Ga. 156 (728 SE2d 238) (2012), affirmed that “we\\n\\nadhere to the view that words alone, regardless of the degree of their insulting\\nnature, will not in any case justify the excitement of passion so as to reduce\\nthe crime from murder to manslaughter.” Id. at 158 (cleaned up). Scott,\\nhowever, held that “the victim’s words in connection with his conduct served\\nas the serious provocation sufficient to excite a sudden, violent and irresistible\\npassion.” Id. (cleaned up; emphasis supplied)).\\n                                       65\\n not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction where his wife\\n\\ntold him that she was seeing someone else that she loved and that\\n\\nshe could no longer love the defendant. See 303 Ga. at 848-852. She\\n\\nalso asked him “if he had been having any issues downstairs” after\\n\\nhe found a receipt from a Florida hospital under their mattress at a\\n\\ntime when he was unaware that his wife had gone to Florida. See id.\\n\\nat 848-849. He then learned that his wife had been experiencing\\n\\n“female issues” due to a new prescription that the Florida hospital\\n\\ngave her. See id. at 848-849 (cleaned up). Clearly, if Appellant had\\n\\na reasonable belief that Tia had been sexually unfaithful, Ware\\n\\nwould have, too. But we held that Ware was not entitled to a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter instruction. See id. at 849-852. The cases\\n\\nin which we have held that the disclosure of sexual infidelity was\\n\\nsufficient to warrant a voluntary manslaughter charge involved\\n\\nextreme circumstances not remotely similar to these facts. For\\n\\nexample, in Brooks v. State, 249 Ga. 583 (292 SE2d 694) (1982), we\\n\\nheld that a voluntary manslaughter instruction was warranted\\n\\nwhere the victim “taunt[ed] [the defendant] with a graphic\\n\\n                                66\\n description of her sexual activities with other men” and “bragg[ed]\\n\\nabout her sexual activities with another gentleman.” Id. at 585\\n\\n(cleaned up). In Strickland v. State, 257 Ga. 230 (357 SE2d 85)\\n\\n(1987), where the defendant did receive a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ncharge but argued on appeal that a limiting instruction the trial\\n\\ncourt gave related to expert testimony was erroneous, we said in\\n\\ndicta that evidence that the victim “recount[ed] her sexual\\n\\ninvolvement with other persons” to him, just after the defendant and\\n\\nvictim had sex and talked about reconciling, warranted a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge. Id. at 231-232 & n.2. Relatedly, in Raines v.\\n\\nState, 247 Ga. 504 (277 SE2d 47) (1981), we held that the trial court\\n\\nshould have instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter where\\n\\nthe paralyzed defendant’s “wife was carrying a letter she had\\n\\nwritten to her boyfriend and upon her husband’s discovery of it not\\n\\nonly admitted her adultery but taunted him with it as well as with\\n\\ndegrading comments about his disability.” Id. at 506. Those cases do\\n\\nnot resemble Appellant’s situation.\\n\\n     In short, the status of Georgia law completely disregarded by\\n\\n                                 67\\n the majority is that only after a trial court concludes that specific\\n\\ncircumstances could constitute serious provocation as a matter of\\n\\nlaw does a jury decide whether the evidence supports the conclusion\\n\\nthat a defendant was seriously provoked in a particular case. The\\n\\ntrial court properly made that legal determination here.\\n\\n     B. What the controlling law is not\\n\\n     All the foregoing cases concern the role of judges as\\n\\ngatekeepers in determining whether a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ncharge must be given to the jury. See, e.g., Tepanca, 297 Ga. at 49-\\n\\n50; Mays, 88 Ga. at 403-404. The majority does not address these\\n\\ncases. Instead, the majority dismisses them, saying that I am trying\\n\\nto keep reasonableness questions away from a jury. But that is not\\n\\nso. Based on the text of the statute, these cases require a trial court\\n\\nto determine as a matter of law whether the victim’s conduct that\\n\\nthe defendant alleges was provocative was the type of “serious\\n\\nprovocation sufficient to excite [a killing] passion in a reasonable\\n\\nperson.” OCGA § 16-5-2 (a). If a defendant offers even slight\\n\\nevidence of such serious provocation, he is entitled to a voluntary\\n\\n                                  68\\n manslaughter charge. See Ware, 303 Ga. at 850. To conclude that I\\n\\nam wrong about this gatekeeping role of a trial court, the majority\\n\\ncites Anderson v. State, 248 Ga. 682 (285 SE2d 533) (1982), Smith v.\\n\\nState, 280 Ga. 161 (625 SE2d 766) (2006), and Elrod v. McConnell,\\n\\n170 Ga. 892 (154 SE 449) (1930), saying that reasonableness\\n\\ndeterminations are for the jury. Those cases do not apply here. The\\n\\nportion of Anderson from which the majority quotes addressed the\\n\\nconstitutional sufficiency of a defendant’s murder conviction, see\\n\\n248 Ga. at 683; Smith did not mention voluntary manslaughter at\\n\\nall, see 280 Ga. at 161-163; and Elrod was not even a criminal case.\\n\\nSee 170 Ga. at 892-893. If the majority is correct that reasonableness\\n\\ndeterminations are always for a jury, that rule disregards and\\n\\nconflicts with our numerous cases holding that various types of\\n\\nprovocative conduct are insufficient to warrant a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge. See, e.g., Ward v. State, 2024 WL 1862343, at\\n\\n*6-7 (Case No. S24A0352, Apr. 30, 2024). 26\\n\\n\\n     26 While the majority says that we should look to the text of a statute,\\n\\nand changes to the text, to determine a statute’s meaning, it implies that the\\n\\n                                     69\\n       Moreover, the adultery cases that the majority cites do not\\n\\nsupport its argument either. Soto v. State, 303 Ga. 517 (813 SE2d\\n\\n343) (2018), is not a case about whether a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ncharge should have been given. There, the jury was charged on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter but convicted the defendant of malice\\n\\nmurder, and on appeal, the defendant argued that as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process the evidence supported a conviction for\\n\\n\\n\\nModel Penal Code provision on voluntary manslaughter should inform the\\nmeaning of voluntary manslaughter law in Georgia, particularly to diminish a\\ntrial court’s role in making the objective determination of provocation required\\nby our statute. The majority does so despite the fact that the MPC provision\\ncontains vastly different text than our voluntary manslaughter statute. The\\nMPC provision has been said to provide a “new, far broader vision” of voluntary\\nmanslaughter law than the type of heat-of-passion law represented by OCGA\\n§ 16-5-2 (a). Joshua Dressler, Why Keep the Provocation Defense?: Some\\nReflections on A Difficult Subject, 86 MINN. L. REV. 959, 960 (2002). In adopting\\nthe MPC test, “the drafters qualified the rigorous objectivity of the common\\nlaw. The common law formulation measures the adequacy of a provocation\\naccording to its effect on a reasonable person. . . . The Model Penal Code, in\\ncontrast, directs the jury to consider the reasonableness of the defendant’s\\nconduct from the viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation. This\\nformulation was intended to introduce a larger element of subjectivity into the\\ndoctrine.” Dan M. Kahan & Martha C. Nussbaum, Two Conceptions of Emotion\\nin Criminal Law, 96 COLUM. L. REV. 269, 321 (1996) (cleaned up). The MPC\\nprovision has been said to have “dysfunction inherent” in it; its test “becomes\\nindeterminate and results in excusing serious homicides from being treated\\nproperly as murders, when applied to real cases.” David Crump, “Murder,\\nPennsylvania Style”: Comparing Traditional American Homicide Law to the\\nStatutes of Model Penal Code Jurisdictions, 109 W. VA. L. REV. 257, 318-319\\n(2007).\\n                                       70\\n voluntary manslaughter only, because he became enraged after\\n\\nseeing the woman he loved embrace and kiss another man. See id.\\n\\nat 519. In holding that “it is for the jury to determine whether the\\n\\nactions alleged to have provoked the defendant actually occurred\\n\\nand whether these actions were sufficient provocation to excite the\\n\\ndeadly passion of a reasonable person,” id., we correctly refused to\\n\\nsecond-guess the jury’s determination of the adequacy of the serious\\n\\nprovocation that the trial court determined was present. But Soto\\n\\ndecided nothing about a trial court’s authority as an initial matter\\n\\nto decide whether the evidence showed “serious provocation\\n\\nsufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person.” OCGA § 16-\\n\\n5-2 (a). Likewise, Lynn v. State, 296 Ga. 109 (765 SE2d 322) (2014),\\n\\ndid not hold that the mere disclosure of past infidelity warrants a\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter charge. In that case, the jury was charged\\n\\non voluntary manslaughter, and the only question on appeal was\\n\\nwhether the trial court erred in excluding evidence that arguably\\n\\nsupported the defendant’s testimony about provocative disclosures\\n\\nhis wife made in the argument that immediately preceded the\\n\\n                                 71\\n killing. See 296 Ga. at 111-112. Similarly, Lawson v. State, 280 Ga.\\n\\n881 (635 SE2d 134) (2006), addressed the constitutional sufficiency\\n\\nof the evidence supporting a defendant’s convictions; see id. at 882;\\n\\nJones v. State, 314 Ga. 692 (878 SE2d 502) (2022), addressed the\\n\\nconstitutional sufficiency of a defendant’s felony murder conviction\\n\\nwhere the jury was instructed on, and the defendant argued on\\n\\nappeal that he was only guilty of, voluntary manslaughter, see id. at\\n\\n694-696; McGuire v. State, 307 Ga. 500 (837 SE2d 339) (2019),\\n\\ninvolved a defendant who argued that the State did not exclude the\\n\\nreasonable hypothesis that he acted based upon serious provocation\\n\\nwhere the jury was charged on voluntary manslaughter but rejected\\n\\nthat defense and convicted him of malice murder, see id. at 503-505;\\n\\nand Moses v. State, 270 Ga. 127 (508 SE2d 661) (1998), discussed the\\n\\nalleged error of a jury charge about the relationship between malice\\n\\nand serious provocation. See id. at 130. None of these cases involve\\n\\nthe reversal of a murder conviction due to the trial court’s failure to\\n\\ninstruct on voluntary manslaughter.\\n\\n     The voluntary-manslaughter-instruction cases the majority\\n\\n                                  72\\n cites fare no better. In Clough v. State, 298 Ga. 594 (783 SE2d 637)\\n\\n(2016),   we    reversed    for   failure   to   instruct    on   voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter where, among other things, the defendant broke into\\n\\nhis mother-in-law’s house and found his wife and the victim in bed\\n\\ntogether, but that case does not control here for at least three\\n\\nreasons. See id. at 594-597. 27 First, Clough involved a defendant who\\n\\nfound his spouse in bed with another man. See id. at 595. Second,\\n\\nthe portion of Clough that the majority quotes cited Goforth v. State,\\n\\n271 Ga. 700 (523 SE2d 868) (1999). In Goforth, we pointed to the\\n\\ncompromising situation that “at the time of the homicide [the victim]\\n\\nwas in the bedroom . . . engaging in an act of consensual sex” with\\n\\n\\n\\n      27 In Clough, the Court did not grapple with whether the defendant’s\\n\\nbreaking into the house to kill the victim meant that his passion was not\\nstatutorily “sudden” or address whether the instructional error harmed the\\ndefendant. See 298 Ga. at 595-598. In that case, Clough and his wife were\\nestranged and had been separated for months. See id. at 594-595. Clough’s wife\\nhad been staying with her mother part of the time. See id. On the night of the\\nhomicide, Clough broke into his mother-in-law’s house after seeing vehicles\\nowned by the victim parked outside, and he stabbed the victim to death upon\\nfinding him in bed with his wife. See id. Clough also committed aggravated\\nassault against his wife and his mother-in-law. See id. at 594-595 & n.1. The\\nCourt may have opted not to address harmlessness given the determination\\nthat the trial court was authorized to re-sentence Clough for felony murder\\npremised on burglary. See id. at 598. Nonetheless, any doubts I may have about\\nClough need not be resolved today, because it is clearly distinguishable.\\n                                     73\\n the defendant’s former girlfriend. Id. at 700-701. At trial, the jury\\n\\nwas instructed on voluntary manslaughter but convicted the\\n\\ndefendant of malice murder, and on appeal, the defendant contended\\n\\nthat he was only guilty of voluntary manslaughter. See id. at 701.\\n\\nWe again rightly held in Goforth that it was for the jury to find\\n\\nwhether the evidence showed that the defendant was guilty of\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter or murder but said nothing about the\\n\\nstandard for jury instructions in this context. Third, Goforth had\\n\\nnothing to do with the issue in Clough — whether a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter instruction was warranted — and should not have\\n\\nbeen the authority to which the Court turned in that case.\\n\\nAccordingly, Clough and Goforth are irrelevant here. Additionally,\\n\\nin Richardson v. State, 189 Ga. 448 (5 SE2d 891) (1939), we held\\n\\nthat a defendant was entitled to a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ninstruction where she saw the victim “lay on the ground with [the\\n\\ndefendant’s husband]” “behind some bushes” in an empty lot at\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 74\\n night. Id. at 448-449.28 Knowing that a voluntary manslaughter\\n\\ninstruction is warranted when a defendant discovers his partner\\n\\nlying down with someone else in bed or in some other secluded area29\\n\\nsays nothing about whether one is warranted when a defendant sees\\n\\nhis partner, fully clothed, in the driver’s seat of a car and a rumored\\n\\nparamour walking near the car, at the normal commute times for\\n\\nboth people. Similarly, the majority’s discussion of Ware is\\n\\nincomplete. As I pointed out above, the victim’s words in that case\\n\\nall but said that the victim was having an affair, but we still held\\n\\nthat they did not require a voluntary manslaughter charge. See\\n\\nWare, 303 Ga. at 848-852. If Appellant here held a reasonable belief\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     28 In  Richardson, the Court determined that the error in refusing to\\ninstruct on voluntary manslaughter was not rendered harmless by a charge on\\nthe then-existing principle that “where a wife catches her husband in the act\\nof adultery with another woman, . . . she would have the right to kill such\\nwoman.” 189 Ga. at 449. That principle of law was later abrogated. See Burger\\nv. State, 238 Ga. 171, 171-172 (231 SE2d 769) (1977) (describing justifiable\\nhomicide instruction in such circumstances as “uncivilized,” and holding that\\nit was no longer authorized when a defendant kills in order to prevent the\\ncompletion of adultery).\\n      29 Despite our euphemistic language in Richardson, the appellate record\\n\\nin that case shows that the defendant stated she found her husband and the\\nvictim “having intercourse,” that her husband was “on top of” the victim, and\\nthat her husband “had his pants down.”\\n                                     75\\n about Tia’s sexual infidelity, surely Ware did, too.\\n\\n     In addressing why Appellant’s belief was reasonable, the\\n\\nmajority asserts that Smith’s smirk constituted slight evidence of\\n\\ntaunting. A smirk does not even remotely rise to the level of\\n\\n“taunting” about sexual conduct in the way that our mere-words\\n\\nprecedent uses that word. For example, we use the word “taunting”\\n\\nto describe graphic descriptions of sexual intercourse with others,\\n\\nsee Brooks, 249 Ga. at 585-586, recounting one’s sexual encounters\\n\\nwith others immediately after sex with one’s own partner and a\\n\\nproposed reconciliation, see Strickland, 257 Ga. at 231-232, telling\\n\\na paralyzed man that he was “half a man,” “no good,” and could not\\n\\nhave sexual intercourse with his partner the way that others did,\\n\\nRaines, 247 Ga. at 505-506, or telling a family member, who suspects\\n\\nthe victim of molesting the family member’s minor niece, that “she’s\\n\\nmy b––––, I can do whatever I want.” Scott v. State, 291 Ga. 156,\\n\\n157-158 (728 SE2d 238) (2012). A smirk falls far short of that\\n\\nstandard.\\n\\n     In conclusion, by relying on this inapposite case law, the\\n\\n                                  76\\n majority holds that Appellant was entitled to a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter instruction because a reasonable person could\\n\\nconclude under the circumstances that Appellant reasonably\\n\\nbelieved Tia and Smith had, at some time prior to the killing, had\\n\\nsex. The majority’s new standard has the practical effect of\\n\\ntransforming the legal question of what constitutes serious\\n\\nprovocation into a factual one that a jury resolves and thus\\n\\neliminating the role of a trial judge to decide questions of law.30 This\\n\\nnew standard is such a low one that it basically does not exist at all.\\n\\n      C. How the majority’s view makes Georgia an outlier\\n\\n      The majority’s new standard also makes Georgia an outlier\\n\\namong our sister states, which require more than a reasonable belief\\n\\n\\n\\n      30 On this same point, the concurrence’s suggestion that a “sufficiently\\n\\nshocking” “dramatic disclosure” can warrant a voluntary manslaughter charge\\nfinds no support in our case law and is equally as broad as the majority’s new\\nstandard. Additionally, I do not see how that standard is useful to a trial court\\nthat is trying to decide whether an instruction is warranted during the heat of\\na charge conference. Finally, the concurrence’s advice to trial courts not to\\n“assess the sufficiency of the alleged provocation or the reasonableness of the\\ndefendant’s response” runs contrary to the plain language of OCGA § 16-5-2\\n(a) and our longstanding case law requiring trial courts to determine as a\\nmatter of law whether the alleged serious provocation is sufficient to excite a\\nsudden, violent, and irresistible passion in a reasonable person.\\n                                       77\\n that a partner has been sexually unfaithful at some prior time in\\n\\norder to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. See State v.\\n\\nSimonovich, 688 SE2d 67, 71 (N.C. App. 2010) (“When one spouse\\n\\nkills the other in a heat of passion engendered by the discovery of\\n\\nthe deceased and a paramour in the very act of intercourse, or under\\n\\ncircumstances clearly indicating that the act had just been\\n\\ncompleted, or was severely proximate, and the killing follows\\n\\nimmediately, it is manslaughter. However, a mere suspicion, belief,\\n\\nor knowledge of past adultery between the two will not change the\\n\\ncharacter of the homicide from murder to manslaughter.” (cleaned\\n\\nup)); Knight v. State, 907 S2d 470, 479 (Ala. Crim. App. 2004)\\n\\n(“Based on over 100 years of precedent we hold that no instruction\\n\\non heat-of-passion manslaughter was warranted in this case\\n\\nbecause [the defendant] did not catch his wife in the act of\\n\\nadultery.”); State v. Cooley, 536 SE2d 666, 668 (S.C. 2000)\\n\\n(explaining that “in general, South Carolina has allowed marital\\n\\ninfidelity to support a charge of marital voluntary manslaughter\\n\\nonly when the killer finds the other spouse and paramour in a guilty\\n\\n                                78\\n embrace or flagrantly suggestive situation,” and noting a narrow\\n\\nexception where a husband, who believes that his wife has been\\n\\nrepeatedly, violently raped, is taunted by the believed-to-be rapist\\n\\n(cleaned up)) 31; State v. John, 30 N.C. 330, 336 (1848) (“A belief —\\n\\nnay, a knowledge, by the prisoner, that the deceased had been\\n\\ncarrying on an adulterous intercourse with his wife, cannot change\\n\\nthe character of the homicide. . . . It is the sudden fury excited by\\n\\nfinding a man in the very act of shame with his wife, which mitigates\\n\\nthe offence of the husband, who kills his wrongdoer at the instant;\\n\\nbut to the offence of one, who kills upon passion, excited by a less\\n\\ncause — by a mere belief of the act — the law allows of no\\n\\nmitigation.”).

In that case, the Supreme\\nCourt of South Carolina held that no voluntary manslaughter instruction was\\nwarranted even though the defendant subjectively believed that his wife was\\nhaving an affair, because there was “no allegation that [the defendant] actually\\nencountered [his wife] in an adulterous situation.” Cooley, 536 SE2d at 668-\\n669. Neither did Appellant.\\n                                      79\\n manslaughter, but it is not generally manslaughter where the\\n\\npassion is based on mere suspicion[.]”). See also 2 Wharton’s\\n\\nCriminal Law § 22:5 (16th ed.

Why the facts here do not require a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge\\n\\n     The majority describes what Appellant saw as a compromising\\n\\nsituation that prompted a reasonable belief of Tia’s sexual infidelity.\\n\\nCatching a partner in a compromising situation is not the applicable\\n\\nstandard, even if the situation raises suspicions in one’s mind as to\\n\\nthe partner’s faithfulness. As explained above, the “compromising\\n\\n                                    81\\n situation” language appears in a portion of Goforth where we\\n\\ndiscussed the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence of the\\n\\ndefendant’s malice murder conviction. See 271 Ga. at 701. Appellant\\n\\ndid not witness Tia and Smith having sex that morning, nor was\\n\\nthere any evidence that Appellant thought they did. To the contrary,\\n\\nAppellant observed Smith, fully clothed, walking away from Tia’s\\n\\ncar, where Tia was sitting in the driver’s seat, fully clothed, during\\n\\nTia’s normal commute time. Appellant said that he “put two and two\\n\\ntogether,” that he thought “it’s really true,” and that Tia looked at\\n\\nhim as if she had “been caught.” What did he put together? What\\n\\nwas true? What did he think he caught her doing? The rumor\\n\\nAppellant heard was that Tia went riding around town in a vehicle\\n\\nafter a party one night with another female and Smith. Appellant\\n\\nnever claimed to have thought that Tia and Smith had ever had sex,\\n\\nmuch less that they did so that morning. Nevertheless, the majority\\n\\nholds that the trial court should have considered something\\n\\nAppellant never said as slight evidence supporting voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter when deciding how to instruct the jury. I may tend to\\n\\n                                 82\\n agree with the majority that Appellant’s discovery suggested Tia\\n\\nhad developed a romantic relationship with Smith, but this would\\n\\nnot “indicate with reasonable certainty to a rational mind” that Tia\\n\\nand Smith had “just then” had sex, which is what voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter demands. Mays, 88 Ga. at 403-404. Appellant never\\n\\nsaid, in his statement to police or his trial testimony, that he thought\\n\\nTia and Smith were having sex that morning. Indeed, even if\\n\\nAppellant had said that he thought that Tia and Smith were having\\n\\nan affair, that statement alone would not entitle him to a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter charge. See Tepanca, 297 Ga. at 49-50.\\n\\n     In addition, words alone, let alone Smith’s smirk or Tia’s\\n\\nallegedly guilty facial expression, do not constitute serious\\n\\nprovocation. See Ware, 303 Ga. at 850 (“We have long held that\\n\\nwords alone, regardless of the degree of their insulting nature, will\\n\\nnot in any case justify the excitement of passion so as to reduce the\\n\\ncrime from murder to manslaughter where the killing is done solely\\n\\non account of the indignation aroused by use of opprobrious words.”\\n\\n(cleaned up)). Smith’s comments to Appellant — “f**k you,” “what?”,\\n\\n                                  83\\n and “something was going on between” Tia and Smith — do not come\\n\\nclose to fitting the words-alone exception because Smith did not\\n\\ntauntingly detail Tia and Smith’s sexual encounters to Appellant.\\n\\nSee Ware, 303 Ga. at 850-851; Brooks, 249 Ga. at 585-586; Raines,\\n\\n247 Ga. at 506. This would be true even if Smith had said he and\\n\\nTia previously slept together. See Humphreys v. State, 175 Ga. 705,\\n\\n708-709 (165 SE 733) (1932); Stevens v. State, 137 Ga. 520, 521-522\\n\\n(73 SE 737) (1912).\\n\\n     Lastly, adding the words and conduct together leads to no\\n\\ndifferent result. No one ever told Appellant that Tia and Smith had\\n\\nsex, Appellant did not see them having sex, and seeing Smith, fully\\n\\nclothed, walking near Tia’s car would not indicate with reasonable\\n\\ncertainty that they had just finished doing so. As a matter of law,\\n\\nAppellant was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction.\\n\\nSee, e.g., Tepanca, 297 Ga. at 49-50 (reasoning that the trial court\\n\\ndid not err in failing to instruct the jury on sexual jealousy, because\\n\\nthe defendant’s “sexual jealousy was based wholly on supposition”);\\n\\nCulmer v.

Suppose that Vickie and\\n\\nDaryl have been dating for a few months. Daryl is quite the jealous\\n\\ntype. He learns that Vickie has an assigned cubicle at work next to\\n\\na male co-worker named Leonard. Daryl asks Vickie if she is\\n\\ncarrying on an affair with Leonard, and Vickie says that she is not.\\n\\nLater that year, Vickie’s office hosts a holiday party. At the party,\\n\\nDaryl walks across the ballroom to get a drink while Vickie freshens\\n\\nup in the restroom. Daryl waits in line and, a few minutes later,\\n\\nturns around to see Vickie returning from the hallway leading to the\\n\\nrestroom, walking with Leonard, and laughing. Bursting with rage,\\n\\nDaryl yells at Vickie, asking what she was doing in the restroom.\\n\\nFearful for her life, Vickie runs. Daryl assumes that if she is running\\n\\nfrom him, she must be guilty of sexual infidelity. He chases her\\n\\ndown, tackles her, and strangles her to death. According to the\\n\\n                                  87\\n majority, these facts would demand a jury charge on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter because a jury could find that Daryl might have\\n\\nreasonably believed Vickie had sex with Leonard at some time\\n\\nbefore the killing. That result, contrary to a century of precedent,\\n\\nestablishes a concerning course in a country where approximately\\n\\n34% of female murder victims are killed by their intimate partners.\\n\\nSee Erica L. Smith, Female Murder Victims and Victim-Offender\\n\\nRelationship, 2021, Bureau of Justice Statistics (Dec. 1, 2022),\\n\\nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/female-murder-victims-and-victim-offender-\\n\\nrelationship-2021. See also Donna K. Coker, Heat of Passion and\\n\\nWife Killing: Men Who Batter/Men Who Kill, 2 S. CAL. REV. L. &\\n\\nWOMEN’S STUD. 71, 91 (1992) (observing that “[a]pproximately 60%\\n\\nof men who kill their wives allege that she was sexually unfaithful”\\n\\n(cleaned up)).\\n\\n     Similarly, assume the same facts except that Daryl does not go\\n\\nto the holiday party. Instead, Vickie attends alone and, in a moment\\n\\nof romantic intrigue, has sex with Leonard. The next day, Vickie\\n\\nconfesses to Daryl that she has cheated on him. Daryl becomes\\n\\n                                88\\n enraged and fatally shoots her on the spot. According to the\\n\\nmajority,   Daryl   should   receive   a   voluntary   manslaughter\\n\\ninstruction because Vickie disclosed her sexual infidelity. But see\\n\\nWare, 303 Ga. at 850-851; Humphreys, 175 Ga. at 708-709; Stevens,\\n\\n137 Ga. at 521-522.\\n\\n     In sum, the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter based on our longstanding precedent, and\\n\\nI cannot endorse the majority’s newly created and broad standard\\n\\neffectively relegating all future domestic violence-related murders\\n\\nto voluntary manslaughter upon the notion that some jury may\\n\\nbelieve, based wholly on supposition, that the defendant reasonably\\n\\nbelieved the deceased had at some point had sex with someone else.\\n\\nFor trial courts across this State, the lesson to learn from the\\n\\nmajority opinion (and the concurrence) is that a voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter instruction should be given in every domestic-violence\\n\\nrelated homicide case, regardless of whether the defendant said that\\n\\nhe thought his partner had cheated on him just before the killing\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 89\\n occurred and even if the evidence clearly shows that she had not. 32\\n\\n      2. Any instructional error was harmless.\\n\\n      Moreover, even if everything that the majority says about\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter is right, which it most assuredly is not, I\\n\\nwould still affirm because it is highly probable that any instructional\\n\\nerror did not contribute to the verdict. See Hatney v. State, 308 Ga.\\n\\n438, 441 (841 SE2d 702) (2020). The State introduced strong\\n\\nevidence of malice murder and aggravated assault; Appellant’s\\n\\ntestimony was contradicted by his statement to police and by the\\n\\nvideo evidence presented at trial; and Appellant’s own version of\\n\\nevents contradicted voluntary manslaughter. When determining\\n\\nwhether a nonconstitutional error was harmless, we weigh the\\n\\nevidence as reasonable jurors, not by asking what a single juror may\\n\\nhave thought about the evidence. See id. Although Appellant\\n\\nclaimed at the beginning of his interview with the police a few hours\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      32 I also note that the concurrence’s standard differs from that of the\\n\\nmajority; thus, it appears that the majority’s novel standard only garnered the\\napproval of a plurality of this Court.\\n                                      90\\n after the homicide that he did not know what happened,33 he went\\n\\non to describe in detail what did. For example, Appellant recounted\\n\\nthe time that he left work, the places he drove, the reason why he\\n\\nstopped at the gas station, and his conversation and altercation with\\n\\nSmith. Appellant maintained in his interview that he went home\\n\\nbefore driving to the gas station, but at trial on direct examination,\\n\\nhe contradicted himself, claiming that he drove toward his home but\\n\\nturned around before arriving there. Appellant even told police that\\n\\nhe did not “really care about what [Tia and Smith] had going on” but\\n\\nwas upset that he had been deceived. And when police asked\\n\\nAppellant about Smith’s reaction and if “the way [Smith] was acting\\n\\ntoward[ ] [Appellant] like, kind of fueled [him] even more,” Appellant\\n\\nsaid, “No,” that he was just “hurt,” that he “want[ed] answers,” and\\n\\n\\n      33 In context, this statement is better understood to mean that Appellant\\n\\ndid not know how Smith died — not that he couldn’t remember beating and\\nkicking Smith to death. Compare Scott, 291 Ga. at 157-158 (holding that a\\nvoluntary manslaughter instruction was warranted where, among other\\nevidence, the defendant “stated he ‘lost it,’ ‘blacked out,’ and started shooting”).\\nMoreover, I doubt that memory loss, by itself, strongly supports voluntary\\nmanslaughter. See Mobley v. State, 314 Ga. 38, 42-44 (875 SE2d 655) (2022)\\n(holding that no evidence supported a voluntary manslaughter instruction, in\\npart because the defendant “did not testify that he was provoked, angry, or\\ninflamed,” just “that he could not remember what happened”).\\n                                        91\\n that Smith was being “disrespectful” to him. See id. at 440-442\\n\\n(reasoning, when explaining the harmlessness of an assumed error\\n\\nbased on failure to instruct on voluntary manslaughter, that the\\n\\ndefendant’s self-described motives were “more demonstrative of\\n\\ndeliberation than irresistible passion”). And Appellant did not\\n\\nmention in his interview with police that Smith stabbed him; he only\\n\\nclaimed that at trial.\\n\\n     Furthermore, at trial when defense counsel asked Appellant if\\n\\nhe saw “someone get out of [Tia’s] car” when he drove behind the gas\\n\\nstation (which Appellant claimed he “usually” did), 34 Appellant\\n\\ntestified, “I seen like he — Yes, sir.” But, surveillance videos flatly\\n\\nshowed that Smith was already out of Tia’s car and walking away\\n\\nwhen Appellant drove behind the gas station, and Appellant told\\n\\npolice during his interview that Smith “wasn’t in the car.” Appellant\\n\\nwent on in his testimony to deny running after Smith and kicking\\n\\n\\n     34 The jury had before it photos of the gas station, which showed that the\\n\\ngas station had two driveways off the road that allowed a person to enter the\\nproperty at one driveway, drive between a set of gas pumps and the front of\\nthe store, and exit using the next driveway. Thus, driving behind the gas\\nstation to exit was unnecessary.\\n                                     92\\n Smith in the face or head, despite surveillance videos and medical\\n\\nevidence plainly showing otherwise. And the jury heard evidence\\n\\nthat after brutally beating Smith, kicking Smith in the head with\\n\\nsteel-toed boots, and recognizing that Smith was unconscious,\\n\\nAppellant got into his vehicle, started to drive away, stopped, backed\\n\\nup, got out, and returned to kick Smith more. He did not call 911 to\\n\\nrequest medical attention for Smith or ask the gas station owner to\\n\\ndo so.\\n\\n     Shortly after the killing, Appellant called family members to\\n\\ntell them that he “got in a fight.” He did not, by contrast, tell them\\n\\nthat he found Tia and Smith together immediately after they had\\n\\nsex, became homicidally angry, and had since calmed down.\\n\\nCompare Scott, 291 Ga. at 157-158 (focusing on evidence that the\\n\\ndefendant said he “lost it” and “blacked out” at the time of the\\n\\nhomicide, when holding that the trial court should have instructed\\n\\nthe jury on voluntary manslaughter (cleaned up)). Nor did he tell\\n\\nthem that Smith needed medical attention. Then, a few weeks later\\n\\nin jail, Appellant called a woman he described at trial as “[j]ust a\\n\\n                                 93\\n friend” of his from before the killing. On the jail call, which the State\\n\\nplayed at trial, Appellant referred to the woman as “baby,” asked\\n\\nher to send him pictures, and made sexually suggestive remarks.\\n\\nThe call destroyed Appellant’s credibility because it suggested to the\\n\\njury that Appellant had been sexually unfaithful to Tia,\\n\\nnotwithstanding his claims at trial that he was working to improve\\n\\ntheir relationship and that Tia’s conduct hurt him. The upshot of\\n\\nweighing all these contradictions is that reasonable jurors would\\n\\nhave disregarded Appellant’s story because it so wholly and\\n\\nunreasonably contradicted other evidence.\\n\\n     Lastly, even setting aside everything I just said about the\\n\\nunbelievability of Appellant’s story and assuming that the jury\\n\\ncredited his version of events, his own testimony singularly\\n\\nforeclosed the harmfulness of any error. He rejected a pretrial\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter plea deal, and consistent with that\\n\\nrejection, his testimony at trial focused on self-defense as his main\\n\\ndefense. Cf. McClure v. State, 306 Ga. 856, 866-867 (834 SE2d 96)\\n\\n(2019) (Nahmias, P.J., concurring) (explaining, with respect to\\n\\n                                   94\\n affirmative defenses, that failing “to give an instruction on an\\n\\nalternative defense that is supported by only the slightest evidence\\n\\nand that is inconsistent with the defendant’s own account of the\\n\\nevents or with the main defense theory presented at trial” is likely\\n\\nharmless). 35 Even when defense counsel tried to get Appellant to\\n\\ntestify about the overpowering passion that caused him to kill\\n\\nSmith, Appellant testified that he was not “vicious mad,” did not\\n\\nintend to kill Smith, and acted in self-defense. For example, when\\n\\ndefense counsel asked Appellant if he was angry, Appellant said, “I\\n\\nwasn’t angry.” Counsel immediately asked Appellant again, “Were\\n\\n\\n\\n      35 This argument does not misunderstand then-Presiding Justice\\nNahmias’s reasoning about the failure to instruct on alternative defenses.\\nFailing to instruct on a defense or lesser offense the defendant himself\\ncontradicted will in most cases be harmless, regardless of whether the\\ndefendant’s other defense was strong or weak. That is because reasonable\\njurors are unlikely to believe a defense that the defendant himself said did not\\napply to his actions. In the portion of then-Presiding Justice Nahmias’s\\nconcurrence from which the majority quotes, he recognized the same point by\\nusing the word “or.” See McClure, 306 Ga. at 866 (Nahmias, P.J., concurring)\\n(“Presenting inconsistent defenses to the jury, particularly when the\\nevidentiary support for one defense is considerably weaker than for others or\\nwhere a defense is contradicted by the defendant’s own account of events, risks\\nlosing credibility for all of the defenses.” (emphasis supplied)). If then-\\nPresiding Justice Nahmias thought that his reasoning only applied to\\nsituations where the defendant’s other defense was strong, he would have used\\nthe word “and” or left out that second phrase completely.\\n                                      95\\n you angry?” This time, Appellant said that he was but —\\n\\ninconsistent with voluntary manslaughter — downplayed it: “I\\n\\nwasn’t like angry like vicious mad. I was just angry like asking\\n\\nquestions.” And Appellant did so when he still anticipated that the\\n\\ntrial court would instruct on voluntary manslaughter. Weighing all\\n\\nthe evidence as reasonable jurors would, I conclude that it is highly\\n\\nprobable that the jury would still have found Appellant guilty of\\n\\nmurder even if the trial court had given the requested jury\\n\\ninstruction on voluntary manslaughter. See Hatney, 308 Ga. at 440-\\n\\n442 (holding that any assumed error in failing to instruct on\\n\\nvoluntary manslaughter was harmless, in part because the\\n\\ndefendant’s own statements undermined voluntary manslaughter).\\n\\nSee also Heyward v. State, 308 Ga. 570, 571-574 (842 SE2d 293)\\n\\n(2020) (holding that any error in failing to instruct on voluntary\\n\\nmanslaughter was harmless, given the strong evidence of malice);\\n\\nGuerrero v. State, 307 Ga. 287, 288-289 (835 SE2d 608) (2019)\\n\\n(holding that any assumed error in failing to instruct on justification\\n\\nwas harmless, because for the jury to conclude that the killing was\\n\\n                                  96\\n justified, it “would have had to independently concoct a theory of\\n\\n[the victim’s] death that was inconsistent with the State’s theory of\\n\\nthe case, inconsistent with [the defendant’s] own account of the\\n\\nevents, and instead based upon a combination of inferences from a\\n\\nvariety of evidentiary sources”); Noel v.

GRANT v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       BETHEL, Justice.\\n\\n       After a jury trial in January 2020, Nelaunte Grant (“Grant”)\\n\\nwas convicted of felony murder in connection with the January 2018\\n\\nshooting death of Shawntray Grant (“Shawntray”).1 In her sole\\n\\n\\n       1 The record indicates no familial relationship between Nelaunte Grant\\n\\nand Shawntray Grant. Shawntray was killed in the early morning hours of\\nJune 15, 2018. In February 2019, a Chatham County grand jury indicted Grant\\nand co-indictees Osha Dunham, Jahonne Manigo, Malik McKenzie, Cordell\\nRichardson, Donnell Richardson, and Jevon Williams, individually and as\\nparties to the crime, in a 108-count indictment for crimes related to\\nShawntray’s death, as well as additional unrelated crimes. In connection with\\nShawntray’s death, Grant was charged with felony murder predicated on\\narmed robbery and armed robbery; Grant was not charged with any\\ninvolvement in the additional crimes. Grant, Dunham, and Donnell\\nRichardson were tried jointly before a jury from January 7 to January 15, 2020.\\nAt trial, the jury found Grant guilty of felony murder and armed robbery.\\nDunham was found guilty of malice murder and other crimes in connection\\nwith Shawntray’s death; Dunham’s case is not part of this appeal. Richardson\\nwas found not guilty on all counts. The trial court sentenced Grant to serve life\\nin prison on the felony murder count, and the armed robbery count merged\\nwith the felony murder count for sentencing purposes.\\n      Grant filed a timely motion for new trial, which was later amended\\n enumeration of error, Grant contends that the evidence presented\\n\\nat trial was insufficient both as a matter of constitutional due\\n\\nprocess and under Georgia statutory law to support her conviction\\n\\nfor felony murder. 2 Upon reviewing the evidence presented at trial,\\n\\nwe conclude that the evidence, though not overwhelming, was\\n\\nsufficient to support Grant’s conviction. We therefore affirm.\\n\\n      1. Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdicts, the\\n\\nevidence presented at trial showed the following. On June 14, 2018,\\n\\nShawntray invited Erika Street and two others to accompany him\\n\\nfor an evening of gambling on a boat that departed from Brunswick.\\n\\nGrant, a friend of Street’s who was temporarily staying with Street,\\n\\nwas included in the outing, and Shawntray picked the two of them\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthrough new counsel. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the amended\\nmotion on January 23, 2024. Grant then filed a timely notice of appeal, and her\\ncase was docketed to the April 2024 term of this Court and submitted for a\\ndecision on the briefs.\\n      2 We consider Grant’s argument that the trial evidence was insufficient\\n\\nto prove armed robbery only insofar as it bears on her contention that\\ninsufficient evidence supported her conviction for felony murder predicated on\\narmed robbery. Because the armed robbery count merged into the felony\\nmurder count for sentencing purposes, any separate challenge to the armed\\nrobbery count is moot. See Morris v. State, 310 Ga. 443, 443 n.2 (851 SE2d 593)\\n(2020).\\n                                      2\\n up. Street gave Grant money to play some games because Grant did\\n\\nnot have any and “was waiting on some money to come in.” While on\\n\\nthe boat, Shawntray won about $10,000, which was paid out mostly\\n\\nin $100 bills. While Shawntray was accumulating these winnings,\\n\\nGrant was sitting at a nearby slot machine but was not playing.\\n\\nWhile observing Shawntray from her seat, Grant questioned\\n\\nanother patron about the approximate value of Shawntray’s\\n\\nwinnings, which the patron responded was over $10,000.\\n\\n     Because Shawntray had won such a large amount of money, he\\n\\nand the others who had accompanied him, including Grant, were\\n\\npermitted to disembark first with a security escort. Shawntray then\\n\\ndropped off Grant and Street at Street’s residence. Upon their\\n\\narrival at Street’s house, Grant asked to borrow Street’s car to visit\\n\\na friend, and Street acquiesced. A short time later, Street received a\\n\\ncall informing her that Shawntray had been shot. Street called\\n\\nGrant to return to the house. Upon Grant’s return, Grant, Street,\\n\\nStreet’s mother, and another person all drove to the scene of the\\n\\nshooting where everyone, except Grant, exited the vehicle to see\\n\\n                                  3\\n what had happened.\\n\\n     Shawntray’s body was found lying next to his vehicle in the\\n\\nparking lot of his apartment complex. He had suffered multiple\\n\\ngunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police\\n\\nrecovered five shell casings and several spent bullets from around\\n\\nShawntray’s    body,   as   well   as   Shawntray’s   empty   wallet.\\n\\nShawntray’s Springfield XD 9mm handgun was also missing.\\n\\n     While investigating Shawntray’s death, police interviewed\\n\\nGrant three times. Recordings of these interviews were admitted\\n\\ninto evidence and played for the jury at trial. In the interviews,\\n\\nGrant denied seeing Shawntray the entire night on the boat, denied\\n\\nobserving him win money, and denied any knowledge of how much\\n\\nhe had won. Grant also denied being familiar with or ever\\n\\ncommunicating with her co-defendant, Osha Dunham, before or\\n\\nafter the shooting.\\n\\n     However, some of Grant’s statements in her interviews with\\n\\npolice were contradicted by cell phone evidence that was introduced\\n\\nat trial. In particular, Grant’s and Dunham’s cell phone records\\n\\n                                   4\\n showed that Grant communicated with Dunham multiple times\\n\\nbefore and immediately following the shooting, including when\\n\\nGrant and Shawntray were on the boat, though this information had\\n\\nbeen erased from Grant’s phone.3 Dunham’s cell phone records also\\n\\nshowed that he spoke with Grant shortly before the shooting and\\n\\nwas in the vicinity of Shawntray’s apartment soon after Shawntray\\n\\ndropped off Grant and Street at Street’s home. Shortly after the\\n\\nshooting, Dunham changed his cell phone number.\\n\\n      When responding to the scene of another crime in which\\n\\nDunham had been shot in the arm, police officers collected a gun\\n\\nthat a suspect had discarded. 4 The gun was determined to be\\n\\nShawntray’s firearm, which had been listed as stolen during his\\n\\nhomicide. The firearm tested positive for Dunham’s DNA, and\\n\\nDunham’s phone showed that, on July 25, 2018 — ten days after\\n\\n\\n      3 The content of the communications between Grant and Dunham was\\n\\nnot admitted into evidence.\\n      4 Shell casings from Shawntray’s gun were found at locations for multiple\\n\\nother shootings. Dunham was ultimately arrested for Shawntray’s murder and\\nother crimes associated with the unrelated shootings, and he was found guilty\\nof those other crimes at trial. Grant was not charged with any involvement in\\nthese additional crimes, which occurred after and were unrelated to\\nShawntray’s murder.\\n                                      5\\n Shawntray was killed — Dunham had conducted a Google search on\\n\\na   “Springfield   XD   nine   millimeter    30   round    magazine.”\\n\\nInvestigators also uncovered a photograph taken the day Shawntray\\n\\nwas murdered of Dunham holding a large sum of cash. At trial, the\\n\\nthree people who accompanied Grant and Shawntray on the\\n\\ngambling boat all denied knowing Dunham.\\n\\n     2. Grant contends that the evidence presented at trial was\\n\\ninsufficient both as a matter of federal constitutional due process\\n\\nand under Georgia statutory law to support her conviction for felony\\n\\nmurder. We address these arguments in turn.\\n\\n     (a) In challenging the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence,\\n\\nGrant argues that the State failed to prove she was a party to the\\n\\ncrimes and that the evidence at trial showed only her mere\\n\\nassociation with Dunham, the person directly responsible for\\n\\nShawntray’s death. Grant also complains that the State failed to\\n\\npresent evidence of the content of her communications with Dunham\\n\\nor to show that she financially benefitted from Shawntray’s death.\\n\\nWe are not persuaded.\\n\\n                                  6\\n      When we consider the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of\\n\\nconstitutional due process, we view the evidence in the light most\\n\\nfavorable to the jury’s verdicts, and our review is limited to whether\\n\\nthe evidence presented at trial was sufficient to authorize a rational\\n\\njury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the\\n\\ncrimes of which she was convicted. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.\\n\\nS. 307, 319 (III) (B) (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). Where, as\\n\\nhere, the defendant is charged as a party to the crime, conviction\\n\\n“requires proof that the defendant shared a common criminal intent\\n\\nwith the direct perpetrators of the crimes.” Coates v. State, 310 Ga.\\n\\n94, 98 (849 SE2d 435) (2020) (citation and punctuation omitted). Of\\n\\ncourse, “mere presence at the scene of a crime is not sufficient\\n\\nevidence to convict one of being a party to a crime.” Frazier v. State,\\n\\n308 Ga. 450, 453 (2) (a) (841 SE2d 692) (2020) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted). But “[a] jury may infer a common criminal\\n\\nintent from the defendant’s presence, companionship, and conduct\\n\\nwith other perpetrators before, during, and after the crimes.” Coates,\\n\\n310 Ga. at 98 (citation and punctuation omitted). Applying these\\n\\n                                  7\\n principles, we conclude that the evidence presented at Grant’s trial\\n\\nauthorized the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Grant\\n\\nshared a common criminal intent with Dunham, who the jury was\\n\\nalso authorized to conclude was the direct perpetrator of\\n\\nShawntray’s death.\\n\\n     Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence\\n\\nshowed that Grant had knowledge of Shawntray’s substantial\\n\\nwinnings, communicated with Dunham several times on the night\\n\\nof the crimes both before and after Shawntray’s murder, attempted\\n\\nto delete evidence of her communications with Dunham, and lied to\\n\\nofficers about those communications. From this evidence, the jury\\n\\ncould reasonably infer that Grant advised Dunham about\\n\\nShawntray’s winnings and whereabouts, hatched a plan with\\n\\nDunham to rob Shawntray, and then attempted to conceal any\\n\\nevidence of her participation in the crimes. Moreover, the jury could\\n\\ninfer that Grant’s refusal to get out of the vehicle with the others at\\n\\nthe scene of the crime was indicative of her involvement and her\\n\\nguilty conscience. Thus, the jury was authorized to find that Grant\\n\\n                                  8\\n shared a common criminal intent with Dunham, at least to commit\\n\\nthe crime of armed robbery, and that she therefore shared\\n\\nresponsibility for Shawntray’s death that occurred in the course of\\n\\nthat crime. See Frazier, 308 Ga. at 453-454 (2) (b) (evidence of\\n\\nappellant’s actions before and after the crimes, including\\n\\ncommunicating     with   the   direct   perpetrators   and   lying   to\\n\\ninvestigators, supported jury’s finding that appellant was a party to\\n\\nthe crimes rather than an innocent bystander); Fitts v. State, 312\\n\\nGa. 134, 142-143 (3) (859 SE2d 79) (2021) (evidence of appellant’s\\n\\nknowledge and actions before, during, and after the crimes “was\\n\\nsufficient to show that [appellant] intentionally participated in the\\n\\ncriminal plan and was thus sufficient to sustain her convictions”);\\n\\nKim v. State, 309 Ga. 612, 617 (1) (847 SE2d 546) (2020) (noting that\\n\\nthe finder of fact “could reasonably infer that [appellant] lied to the\\n\\npolice because he shared a common criminal intent with his\\n\\nassociate and that the two acted in concert in committing the\\n\\ncrimes”). See also OCGA § 16-2-20 (b) (4) (“A person is concerned in\\n\\nthe commission of a crime only if he . . . [i]ntentionally advises,\\n\\n                                  9\\n encourages, hires, counsels, or procures another to commit the\\n\\ncrime.”).\\n\\n     As to Grant’s complaints about the absence of certain evidence\\n\\nat trial — specifically, evidence showing the content of her\\n\\ncommunications with Dunham and any financial motive for her\\n\\nparticipation in the crimes — the fact that the State did not produce\\n\\ncertain types of evidence does not mean that the evidence was\\n\\ninsufficient. Indeed, it is well settled that the State is required “to\\n\\nprove its case with competent evidence,” and “there is no\\n\\nrequirement that it prove its case with any particular sort of\\n\\nevidence.” Plez v. State, 300 Ga. 505, 506 (1) (796 SE2d 704) (2017).\\n\\nAccordingly, this claim fails.\\n\\n     (b) Grant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to\\n\\nsupport her conviction as a matter of Georgia statutory law, arguing\\n\\nthat the State’s case was based on circumstantial evidence and\\n\\nfailed to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than her guilt.\\n\\nSpecifically, Grant argues that the State failed to exclude the\\n\\n“plausible   explanation”    that        Grant   “innocently”   conveyed\\n\\n                                    10\\n information about Shawntray’s winnings and whereabouts to\\n\\nDunham and later “declined to reveal the communications” out of\\n\\nfear “that she might be implicated.” Again, we disagree.\\n\\n     “When a conviction is based on circumstantial evidence, the\\n\\nState must present sufficient evidence to ‘exclude every other\\n\\nreasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.’” Weems\\n\\nv. State, 318 Ga. 98, 101 (2) (a) (897 SE2d 368) (2024) (quoting OCGA\\n\\n§ 24-14-6). Of course, “not every hypothesis is a reasonable one, and\\n\\nthe evidence need not exclude every conceivable inference or\\n\\nhypothesis — only those that are reasonable.” Graves v. State, 306\\n\\nGa. 485, 487 (1) (831 SE2d 747) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted; emphasis in original). Whether alternative hypotheses are\\n\\nreasonable “is usually a question for the jury, and this Court will not\\n\\ndisturb the jury’s finding unless it is insufficient as a matter of law.”\\n\\nFrazier, 308 Ga. at 453 (2) (a). When assessing whether the\\n\\nprosecution excluded every reasonable hypothesis, “we ask whether\\n\\nthe jury was entitled to discredit alternative theories that could have\\n\\nexplained the circumstantial evidence and to believe the State’s\\n\\n                                   11\\n theory of the case instead.” Fitts, 312 Ga. at 142 (3). And we bear in\\n\\nmind that when considering circumstantial evidence, jurors are\\n\\nentitled to draw reasonable inferences “based on their own common-\\n\\nsense understanding of the world that are ordinarily drawn by\\n\\nordinary [people] in the light of their experience in everyday life.”\\n\\nId. (citations and punctuation omitted). The evidence in this case\\n\\nmeets this standard.\\n\\n     Here, the evidence showed that Grant was the sole link\\n\\nbetween Shawntray and Dunham, as Shawntray’s other companions\\n\\non the night of the crimes testified that they did not know Dunham.\\n\\nAnd the State’s evidence showed that Grant not only communicated\\n\\nwith Dunham multiple times on the night of the crimes, beginning\\n\\nwhile the group was still aboard the gambling cruise and continuing\\n\\nuntil after Shawntray’s murder. Further, one of those calls took\\n\\nplace shortly after Shawntray dropped off Grant and Street at\\n\\nStreet’s house and headed home, and Dunham was shown to be near\\n\\nShawntray’s home at that time. The jury could infer from that\\n\\nevidence that Grant told Dunham that Shawntray was on his way\\n\\n                                 12\\n home so that Dunham would be ready to rob Shawntray.\\n\\n     The evidence also showed that Grant concealed information\\n\\nfrom police officers and, at times, affirmatively misled them.\\n\\nAlthough Grant asserts that she merely “declined to reveal the\\n\\ncommunications” with Dunham to police, the evidence at trial\\n\\nshowed    that   she   went    beyond    simply   concealing   the\\n\\ncommunications. Besides the deletion of her communications with\\n\\nDunham from her phone, Grant told investigators that she did not\\n\\nobserve Shawntray win money on the boat, that she had no\\n\\nknowledge of how much Shawntray won, and that she did not know\\n\\nand had never communicated with Dunham before or after the\\n\\nshooting — claims that were refuted by direct evidence at trial.\\n\\nThus, the jury was authorized to reject as unreasonable the\\n\\nhypothesis that Grant “innocently” communicated information\\n\\nabout Shawntray’s winnings and whereabouts to Dunham and later\\n\\nmade false statements to investigators out of fear. Instead, as we\\n\\ndiscussed above, the jury could have inferred that Grant was trying\\n\\nto conceal that she and Dunham had a motive to rob Shawntray and\\n\\n                                13\\n hatched a plan to do so. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient as\\n\\na matter of Georgia statutory law to support Grant’s conviction, and\\n\\nthis claim likewise fails. See OCGA § 24-14-6. See also McCoy v.\\n\\nState, 315 Ga. 536, 642 (883 SE2d 740) (2023) (“[W]here the jury is\\n\\nauthorized to find that the evidence, though circumstantial,\\n\\nwas sufficient to exclude every reasonable hypothesis save that of\\n\\nthe guilt of the accused, as [it] did here, we will not disturb that\\n\\nfinding unless it is insupportable as a matter of law.” (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted)).\\n\\n     Judgment affirmed.

HOWARD v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n       Isaac Taqai Howard filed a direct appeal seeking review of an\\n\\norder revoking his first-offender status. The Court of Appeals\\n\\napplied its own longstanding precedent to dismiss Howard’s appeal\\n\\nfor lack of jurisdiction because he failed to file an application for\\n\\ndiscretionary appeal. We granted certiorari to determine whether\\n\\nHoward had the right to a direct appeal under OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) or\\n\\nwas instead required to file a discretionary application under OCGA\\n\\n§ 5-6-35 (a). We conclude that the entry of an adjudication of guilt\\n\\nand revocation of a defendant’s first-offender status is directly\\n\\nappealable. Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals’s judgment.\\n\\n       On March 26, 2021, Howard entered two negotiated pleas.\\n\\nHoward and the State agreed to consolidate these cases for purposes\\n of trial and tender them under Georgia’s First Offender Act. The\\n\\ntrial court agreed and sentenced Howard as a first offender to two\\n\\nconcurrent fifteen-year sentences, with the first eighteen months in\\n\\nconfinement and the balance served on probation. Howard received\\n\\ncredit for time served, and he was released from confinement on the\\n\\ndate of the plea hearing.\\n\\n     In November of 2022, the State filed two “Petition[s] for the\\n\\nAdjudication of Guilt and Imposition of Sentence” which alleged that\\n\\nHoward violated the conditions of his probation. After a “Probation\\n\\nRevocation Hearing” on December 14, 2022, the trial court entered\\n\\nan adjudication of guilt on both petitions and resentenced Howard\\n\\non both petitions as a felon to fifteen years, with the first five years\\n\\nin confinement and the balance served on probation. Howard filed a\\n\\nnotice of appeal as to both cases, which the Court of Appeals\\n\\ndismissed in an unpublished order on the ground that Howard’s\\n\\nappeal was an appeal from an “order[] revoking probation” under\\n\\nOCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5) such that Howard’s failure to file an\\n\\napplication for discretionary appeal deprived it of jurisdiction.\\n\\n                                   2\\n      In doing so, the Court of Appeals faithfully applied its decision\\n\\nfrom nearly 40 years ago in Dean v. State, \\n177 Ga. App. 123\\n (\\n338\\n\\nSE2d 711\\n) (1985). The Dean court held over a dissent that the\\n\\nrevocation of a defendant’s first-offender probation was controlled\\n\\nby the discretionary appeal procedure in OCGA § 5-6-35. The court\\n\\noffered three reasons for this conclusion: (1) OCGA § 5-6-35 (a)\\n\\nrequired a discretionary application for appeals from orders\\n\\nrevoking probation, “making no distinction between ‘first-offender’\\n\\nprobation . . . and probation otherwise provided for in criminal\\n\\ncases”; (2) the “purpose of the discretionary appeal statute is in part\\n\\nto reduce the tremendous case load of the state’s appellate courts”;\\n\\nand (3) the First Offender Act provided an avenue of direct appeal\\n\\n“upon the imposition of first-offender status[.]” Dean, 177 Ga. App.\\n\\nat 124 (1) (citing OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5)). Judge Beasley dissented in\\n\\npart and would have held that the entry of an adjudication of guilt\\n\\nand resentencing of a first offender upon the revocation of first-\\n\\noffender status is directly appealable, reasoning that “an appeal\\n\\nfrom a termination of probation under the First Offender Act . . . . is\\n\\n                                  3\\n from more than a mere ‘order revoking probation’” and is “actually\\n\\nan appeal also from the judgment of guilt itself as well as from the\\n\\nnew sentence.” Id. at 127-128 (Beasley, J., dissenting in part).\\n\\n     Howard then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we\\n\\ngranted. Howard argues on appeal that the trial court’s revocation\\n\\nof his first-offender status, entry of an adjudication of guilt, and\\n\\nresentencing constitute a final judgment that is directly appealable.\\n\\nWe agree with Howard and Judge Beasley.\\n\\n    1. Different procedures govern the requirements for direct\\nappeals and discretionary appeals.\\n\\n     “Two code sections primarily govern the method for pursuing\\n\\nappeals to this Court and the Court of Appeals” — OCGA § 5-6-34\\n\\nand OCGA § 5-6-35. Grogan v. City of Dawsonville, \\n305 Ga. 79\\n, 82\\n\\n(2) (\\n823 SE2d 763\\n) (2019). Under OCGA § 5-6-34, subsection (a)\\n\\nidentifies trial court decisions that may be appealed immediately,\\n\\nand subsection (b) provides an interlocutory appeal procedure by\\n\\nwhich a party can obtain permission from the trial court to seek\\n\\nappellate review of a decision that would otherwise not be\\n\\n\\n                                  4\\n immediately reviewable. See OCGA § 5-6-34 (a), (b). If a trial court’s\\n\\ndecision is immediately appealable under OCGA § 5-6-34 (a), a\\n\\nwould-be appellant must then determine whether he or she is\\n\\nentitled to a direct appeal by notice of appeal or must file an\\n\\napplication for discretionary review. 1\\n\\n      OCGA § 5-6-35 “governs the process by which a party must file\\n\\nan application for discretionary review for certain orders that are\\n\\nimmediately appealable.” Grogan, \\n305 Ga. at 82\\n (2). If the\\n\\nunderlying subject matter of the appeal is one of the categories of\\n\\ncases listed in OCGA § 5-6-35 (a), the appeal “shall be by application\\n\\nin the nature of a petition enumerating the errors to be urged on\\n\\nappeal and stating why the appellate court has jurisdiction[,]”\\n\\nOCGA § 5-6-35 (b), “even when the party is appealing a judgment or\\n\\norder that is procedurally subject to [immediate] appeal under\\n\\n\\n\\n      1 We have often used the phrase “direct appeal” confusingly to “refer to\\n\\ntwo different concepts: (1) an immediate appeal [under OCGA § 5-6-34 (a)] for\\nwhich permission is not required to be obtained through the interlocutory\\nreview process; and (2) an appeal that is entitled to come by a notice of appeal,\\nnot an application for discretionary review.” Grogan, \\n305 Ga. at 82\\n (2) n.4. But\\n“[t]hese are not the same.” \\nId.\\n We use “direct appeal” here to mean only the\\nlatter.\\n                                       5\\n OCGA § 5-6-34 (a).” Grogan, \\n305 Ga. at 82\\n (2) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Defendants in criminal cases may take immediate appeals\\n\\nfrom all final judgments, which OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1) defines as\\n\\n“where the case is no longer pending in the court below,” and may\\n\\ndo so by simply filing a notice of appeal (i.e., a direct appeal) unless\\n\\nthe case is one of the specified categories of cases in OCGA § 5-6-35\\n\\n(a) that must come by discretionary application. See Seals v. State,\\n\\n311 Ga. 739\\n, 742-743 (2) (a) (\\n860 SE2d 419\\n) (2021) (a case is “no\\n\\nlonger pending” when the trial court has resolved every count and\\n\\nleft no issue remaining to be resolved), disapproved in part on other\\n\\ngrounds by Gonzales v. State, \\n315 Ga. 661\\n, 665 (1) (b) n.7 (\\n884 SE2d\\n\\n339\\n) (2023). For the categories of cases listed in OCGA § 5-6-35 (a),\\n\\na defendant is not entitled to a direct appeal but instead must file a\\n\\ndiscretionary application to seek appellate review. See OCGA § 5-6-\\n\\n35 (b)-(f) (establishing discretionary application procedure). In\\n\\nparticular, OCGA § 5-6-35 requires a discretionary application for\\n\\n“[a]ppeals from orders revoking probation[.]” OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5).\\n\\n                                   6\\n Whether an appeal from an adjudication of guilt and resentence\\n\\nupon revocation of first-offender status is a final judgment, and\\n\\nwhether it is covered by OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5), require careful\\n\\nconsideration of the First Offender Act.\\n\\n     2. The trial court’s entry of an adjudication of guilt and\\nresentencing upon the revocation of a first-offender status constitutes\\na final judgment that is not covered by OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5).\\n\\n     Under Georgia’s First Offender Act, “a first-time felony\\n\\noffender who enters a guilty plea may be sentenced to probation or\\n\\nconfinement ‘before an adjudication of guilt’ and ‘without entering a\\n\\njudgment of guilt.’” Manner v. State, \\n302 Ga. 877\\n, 888 (III) (\\n808 SE2d\\n\\n681\\n) (2017) (citing OCGA § 42-8-60 (a)2). The First Offender Act is a\\n\\nunique act by which the legislature extends a form of grace to\\n\\nindividuals who commit certain types of crimes. The Act “protect[s]\\n\\nthe first offender from the stigma of having a criminal record until\\n\\n\\n     2 OCGA § 42-8-60 (a) states:\\n\\n\\n\\n     When a defendant has not been previously convicted of a felony,\\n     the court may, upon a guilty verdict or plea of guilty or nolo\\n     contendere and before an adjudication of guilt, without entering a\\n     judgment of guilt and with the consent of the defendant, defer\\n     further proceedings and: (1) [p]lace the defendant on probation; or\\n     (2) [s]entence the defendant to a term of confinement.\\n                                     7\\n an adjudication of guilt has been entered with regard to the crime\\n\\nfor which the defendant was given first offender treatment.” Davis\\n\\nv. State, \\n269 Ga. 276\\n, 277 (2) (\\n496 SE2d 699\\n) (1998). Because of its\\n\\nuniqueness, Georgia courts have sometimes used language more\\n\\nconsistent with typical criminal processes in describing the First\\n\\nOffender Act and the status of first-offenders, causing a fair amount\\n\\nof confusion. See Benton v. State, \\n314 Ga. 498\\n, 503 (2) n.7 (\\n877 SE2d\\n\\n603\\n) (2022) (noting that some of the confusion stems from the Act’s\\n\\nlanguage itself).\\n\\n      a. The entry of an adjudication of guilt and resentencing upon\\nthe revocation of first-offender status constitutes a final judgment.\\n\\n      While plainly amounting to something like a conviction in some\\n\\nsenses (most notably, the offender may be sentenced to prison), the\\n\\nimposition of a first-offender sentence “does not immediately\\n\\nconstitute a ‘conviction’ as that term is defined in Georgia’s Criminal\\n\\nCode.” 3 Benton, 314 Ga. at 501 (2). Instead, the imposition of a first-\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 Georgia’s Criminal Code defines “conviction” as “a final judgment of\\n\\nconviction entered upon a verdict or finding of guilty of a crime or upon a plea\\nof guilty.” OCGA § 16-1-3 (4).\\n                                       8\\n offender sentence under OCGA § 42-8-60 (a) “defer[s] further\\n\\nproceedings[,]” and the charge remains pending for the duration of\\n\\nthe first-offender sentence. See Smith v. State, \\n276 Ga. 263\\n, 265 (2)\\n\\n(\\n577 SE2d 548\\n) (2003) (when a defendant is on first-offender\\n\\nprobation, “there has not been an adjudication of guilt and the\\n\\nmatter remains pending”).\\n\\n      Any probationary sentence entered under [the First\\n      Offender] Act is preliminary only, and, if completed\\n      without violation, permits the offender complete\\n      rehabilitation without the stigma of a felony conviction.\\n      If, however, such offender does not take advantage of such\\n      opportunity for rehabilitation, his [proceeding] which has,\\n      in effect, been suspended is continued and an adjudication\\n      of guilt is made and a sentence entered.\\n\\nState v. Wiley, \\n233 Ga. 316\\n, 317 (\\n210 SE2d 790\\n) (1974). Because the\\n\\ncharge remains pending, no final judgment has occurred, and an\\n\\nimmediate appeal would not be permitted under OCGA § 5-6-34\\n\\nwithout a certificate of immediate review. But OCGA § 42-8-64\\n\\nprovides an avenue of immediate appeal to a defendant sentenced\\n\\nas a first offender. 4\\n\\n\\n      4 OCGA § 42-8-64 states that “[a] defendant sentenced pursuant to this\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     9\\n       “Upon satisfactory completion of a sentence imposed pursuant\\n\\nto [OCGA § 42-8-60 (a)], the defendant is discharged and exonerated\\n\\nof guilt.” Manner, \\n302 Ga. at 888\\n (III) (emphasis added; citing OCGA\\n\\n§ 42-8-60 (e)). But if the defendant violates the terms of first-offender\\n\\nprobation or is convicted of another crime during the pendency of\\n\\nthat sentence, the trial court has discretion to revoke the defendant’s\\n\\nfirst-offender status and “may enter an adjudication of guilt and\\n\\nproceed to sentence the defendant as otherwise provided by law[.]”\\n\\nOCGA § 42-8-60 (d).5\\n\\n      At that point, if the trial court chooses to enter an adjudication\\n\\nof guilt and to resentence the defendant on the counts forming the\\n\\nbasis of the initial first-offender sentence, this revokes the\\n\\ndefendant’s first-offender status and resolves every count such that\\n\\n\\narticle shall have the right to appeal in the same manner and with the same\\nscope and same effect as if a judgment of conviction had been entered and\\nappealed from.”\\n       5 The violation of a first offender’s conditions of probation does not\\n\\nautomatically revoke the first-offender status. “Instead, [the violation] is a\\ncondition which, if met, gives the court discretion to enter an adjudication of\\nguilt.” Benton, 314 Ga. at 502 (2). “If a court exercises its discretion not to enter\\nthat judgment, the first offender is still eligible for exoneration by operation of\\nlaw under OCGA § 42-8-60 (e) once the listed statutory conditions are met.” Id.\\n(emphasis in original).\\n                                         10\\n “the case is no longer pending in the court below[.]” OCGA § 5-6-34\\n\\n(a). See OCGA § 42-8-60 (d); Benton, 314 Ga. at 501-502 (2).\\n\\nTherefore, the entry of an adjudication of guilt and sentence\\n\\nconstitutes a final judgment and triggers the defendant’s right to an\\n\\nimmediate appeal under OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1). See Allen v. State,\\n\\n315 Ga. 524\\n, 525 n.1 (\\n883 SE2d 746\\n) (2023) (case “became subject to\\n\\ndirect appeal” when the trial court entered a conviction and\\n\\nsentence, resolving all counts of the indictment); Benton, 314 Ga. at\\n\\n502 (2) (referring to the trial court’s entry of an adjudication of guilt\\n\\nand sentence for violation of first-offender probation as a\\n\\n“judgment”); Seals, 311 Ga. at 742 (2) (a) (case is final and\\n\\nappealable when the trial court has entered a written judgment that\\n\\nimposes a sentence on each count).\\n\\n     b. An appeal in this context is not an appeal from an order\\nrevoking probation and thus does not require a discretionary\\napplication.\\n\\n     In reliance on the Court of Appeals’s decision in Dean and its\\n\\nprogeny, the State nonetheless argues that Howard was required to\\n\\nfile a discretionary application because OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5)\\n\\n                                   11\\n requires a discretionary application for “[a]ppeals from orders\\n\\nrevoking probation[.]” The Court of Appeals has interpreted that\\n\\nprovision as “making no distinction between ‘first-offender’\\n\\nprobation (see OCGA § 42-8-60 et seq.) and probation otherwise\\n\\nprovided for in criminal cases (see OCGA § 42-8-34).” Dean, 177 Ga.\\n\\nApp. at 124 (1). Put another way, the State argues that an order\\n\\nrevoking probation and an adjudication of guilt after the violation of\\n\\na first-offender sentence are essentially the same and yield the same\\n\\nresult, so they should be treated the same for purposes of appeal.\\n\\nBut the State’s argument and the Court of Appeals precedent on\\n\\nwhich it relies are unsupported by the text of OCGA § 5-6-34, OCGA\\n\\n§ 5-6-35 (a) (5), and OCGA § 42-8-60, and they ignore key differences\\n\\nbetween an adjudication of guilt and an order revoking probation.6\\n\\n      OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1) makes clear that “[a]ll final judgments”\\n\\n\\n\\n      6 Notwithstanding the fact that Dean was decided in 1985, stare decisis\\n\\ndoes not apply to our review of Court of Appeals precedent. See Olevik v. State,\\n302 Ga. 228\\n, 244 (2) (c) (iv) (\\n806 SE2d 505\\n) (2017) (“Under the doctrine of stare\\ndecisis, courts generally stand by their prior decisions[.]” (emphasis added));\\nRollf v. Carter, \\n298 Ga. 557\\n, 559 (\\n784 SE2d 341\\n) (2016) (decisions by the Court\\nof Appeals are not binding on this Court). The question we decide today is a\\nquestion of first impression for this Court.\\n                                       12\\n are entitled to a direct appeal unless the subject matter is one of the\\n\\ncategories of cases listed in OCGA § 5-6-35. The text of OCGA § 5-6-\\n\\n35 (a) does not include the entry of an adjudication of guilt and\\n\\nsentence upon the revocation of first-offender status as one of the\\n\\ncategories of cases which requires the filing of a discretionary\\n\\napplication. See OCGA § 5-6-35 (a). If the legislature had intended\\n\\nto include an adjudication of guilt in that provision, it could have\\n\\n(and still can), but “we do not have the authority to rewrite statutes,\\n\\nso when the text is plain, we must follow it.” McKinney v. State, ___\\n\\nGa. ___ (\\n899 SE2d 121\\n, 125) (2024) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted). Therefore, we reject an interpretation that would add to\\n\\nthe statute that which the legislature did not include. Moreover,\\n\\nOCGA § 5-6-30 directs that the Appellate Practice Act “shall be\\n\\nliberally construed so as to bring about a decision on the merits of\\n\\nevery case appealed and to avoid dismissal of any case or refusal to\\n\\nconsider any points raised therein, except as may be specifically\\n\\nreferred to in this article.” See Premier Pediatric Providers, LLC v.\\n\\nKennesaw Pediatrics, P.C., \\n318 Ga. 350\\n, 359 (3) (\\n898 SE2d 481\\n)\\n\\n                                  13\\n (2024) (“In other words, OCGA § 5-6-30 puts a legislative thumb on\\n\\nthe scale in favor of reaching the merits.”). Accordingly, we do not\\n\\ninterpret OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) in a manner that limits the right to\\n\\nappeal any more than its text requires.\\n\\n     Further, the text of the First Offender Act does not equate the\\n\\nentry of an adjudication of guilt to an order revoking probation. 7 See\\n\\nOCGA § 42-8-60; cf. OCGA § 42-8-34.1 (setting forth conditions and\\n\\nprocedures for revoking probated or suspended sentence under\\n\\nstate-wide probation system); OCGA § 42-8-38 (c) (trial court has\\n\\ndiscretion to revoke, modify, or continue probation under state-wide\\n\\nprobation system); OCGA § 42-8-102 (f) (setting forth procedure for\\n\\nrevoking county and municipal probation).           Moreover, as Judge\\n\\nBeasley argued in dissent in Dean, the fact that an adjudication of\\n\\nguilt often has the effect of revoking a first offender’s probation does\\n\\nnot transform an adjudication of guilt into a probation revocation for\\n\\npurposes of appeal. 177 Ga. App. at 128 (Beasley, J., dissenting in\\n\\n\\n\\n     7 Indeed, the text of OCGA § 42-8-60 does not once mention a “probation\\n\\nrevocation.” See OCGA § 42-8-60.\\n                                    14\\n part). “It is obvious that the General Assembly intended the first\\n\\noffender probation to have a different effect than probation in other\\n\\ncases.” Wiley, \\n233 Ga. at 317\\n.\\n\\n     An important difference between orders revoking ordinary\\n\\nprobation and orders revoking first-offender status is that ordinary\\n\\nprobation is served after a judgment is entered. That affects what\\n\\ncan be appealed when it is revoked: “a mere order revoking\\n\\nprobation proceeds from a sentence based on a judgment entered\\n\\npreviously and the appeal is only from the order.” Dean, 177 Ga.\\n\\nApp. at 128 (Beasley, J., dissenting in part). By the time probation\\n\\nis revoked in that context, “a defendant has already had the right to\\n\\nappeal directly all aspects of the formal adjudication of guilt as well\\n\\nas of the sentence which is bottomed on the judgment of guilt.” Id.\\n\\nat 127-128 (Beasley, J., dissenting in part) (emphasis added). But\\n\\nthat is not the case in an adjudication of guilt that follows the\\n\\nviolation of conditions of first-offender probation, where although\\n\\nOCGA § 42-8-64 gives a first-offender the right to a direct appeal,\\n\\nthere has not yet been an adjudication of guilt.\\n\\n                                  15\\n       During the pendency of a first-offender sentence, there has\\n\\nbeen no adjudication of guilt or final judgment, 8 the first offender is\\n\\nnot considered “convicted” as that term is used in Georgia’s Criminal\\n\\nCode, the “matter remains pending[,]” Smith, \\n276 Ga. at 265\\n (2), and\\n\\nthe first offender has the opportunity — upon the satisfactory\\n\\ncompletion of the first-offender sentence — to be altogether\\n\\nexonerated of guilt and stand discharged as a matter of law. See\\n\\nOCGA § 42-8-60 (e). So when a first-offender sentence is not\\n\\ncompleted successfully and the trial court enters an adjudication of\\n\\nguilt and sentence, this is the first judgment of guilt entered against\\n\\nthat defendant. See OCGA § 42-8-60 (d). At that point, the defendant\\n\\nstands convicted under Georgia’s Criminal Code, and “the new\\n\\nsentence is based on a just-arrived at adjudication of guilt” and “may\\n\\nactually be more severe than the consented-to [first offender]\\n\\n\\n\\n      8 Although the trial court enters a judgment granting a defendant first\\n\\noffender treatment, this does not constitute a final judgment for purposes of\\ndirect appeal because the case remains pending until the defendant complies\\nwith or violates the terms of first-offender probation. Instead, that initial\\njudgment is merely “a judgment granting him first offender treatment instead\\nof imposing a regular sentence with an adjudication of guilt.” Higdon v. State,\\n291 Ga. 821\\n, 824 (2) (a) (\\n733 SE2d 750\\n) (2012).\\n                                      16\\n sentence.” Dean, 177 Ga. App. at 128 (Beasley, J., dissenting in\\n\\npart). Regardless of the duration of the new sentence imposed, the\\n\\nentry of an adjudication of guilt is distinct from an order revoking\\n\\nprobation, and Georgia law does not treat them the same for the\\n\\npurposes of appeal.\\n\\n     c. Claims that the defendant raised or could have raised in\\nappealing the initial imposition of the first-offender sentence may\\nwell be barred in a subsequent appeal from the entry of an\\nadjudication of guilt and sentence.\\n\\n     The State argues that the conclusion we have reached today\\n\\nwill give defendants two bites at the direct appeal apple, as\\n\\ndefendants will be entitled to directly appeal both the initial entry\\n\\nof a first-offender sentence (because OCGA § 42-8-64 says they can)\\n\\nand the entry of an adjudication of guilt and sentence (because it is\\n\\na final judgment under OCGA § 5-6-34). But our holding today is\\n\\nrequired by the statutory text, which we cannot change to achieve a\\n\\n“better” policy outcome. What’s more, our holding does not obviously\\n\\nhave the result the State fears. If a defendant chooses to exercise the\\n\\nright to a direct appeal provided by OCGA § 42-8-64 upon the initial\\n\\n\\n                                  17\\n entry of the first-offender sentence, any argument that the\\n\\ndefendant raises or could have raised in that appeal may well be\\n\\nbarred in a subsequent appeal if that defendant later chooses also to\\n\\nappeal the entry of an adjudication of guilt. See Walker-Madden v.\\n\\nState, \\n301 Ga. 744\\n, 745 (\\n804 SE2d 8\\n) (2017) (“In a second appeal\\n\\nafter remand for resentencing, a criminal defendant may raise\\n\\nissues relating to the new sentencing order but may not raise issues\\n\\nthat were, or could have been, raised in the first appeal of the case.”).\\n\\n     Accordingly, upon the trial court’s entry of an adjudication of\\n\\nguilt, Howard was entitled to a direct appeal under OCGA § 5-6-34\\n\\n(a). Therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals’s judgment and\\n\\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n     Judgment reversed and case remanded. All the Justices concur,\\n\\nexcept, LaGrua, J., who dissents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    18\\n      LAGRUA, Justice, dissenting.\\n\\n     Because defendants receiving a first-offender sentence do not\\n\\nimmediately receive convictions, the legislature has permitted them\\n\\nto file their direct appeals as if they had received a conviction. See\\n\\nOCGA § 42-8-64. Criminal defendants are normally entitled to a\\n\\ndirect appeal after conviction and must file that appeal within 30\\n\\ndays. See OCGA §§ 5-6-34, 5-6-38 (a). With the Majority Opinion,\\n\\nnow some first-offender defendants could also have 30 years — or\\n\\nlonger — if they decide to avail themselves of their new right to a\\n\\ndirect appeal should the trial court revoke probation and enter an\\n\\nadjudication of guilt late in a sentence. While some claims may be\\n\\nbarred, the prosecution, defense, and appellate courts will still be\\n\\nburdened with potentially ancient cases that already had a full\\n\\nopportunity to appeal. They will be placed in the position of dealing\\n\\nwith failing memories, locating long-gone witnesses, and litigating\\n\\nmatters that should have been litigated years before.\\n\\n\\n\\n     The Majority Opinion recognizes that this result is not the best\\n\\n                                 19\\n policy outcome, but nonetheless argues that it is required by the\\n\\nstatutory text. I admit that this is a difficult question, but the grace\\n\\nof the legislature does not go that far. Rather, I agree with the Court\\n\\nof Appeals’ longstanding precedent in Dean that correctly looked at\\n\\nthe text of OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5) and held that “orders revoking\\n\\nprobation” includes just that — orders revoking probation. See Dean\\n\\nv. State, \\n177 Ga. App. 123\\n, 124-125 (1) (\\n338 SE2d 711\\n) (1985). The\\n\\nfact that some of those revocations might also involve an\\n\\nadjudication of guilt under OCGA § 42-8-60 (d) does not remove\\n\\nthose revocations from the clear text of OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (5). The\\n\\nFirst Offender Act still calls first-offender probation “probation”\\n\\neven though the legislature intended it to have a different effect. See\\n\\nOCGA § 42-8-60 (a)-(g) (referencing “probation” fifteen times).\\n\\n     Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  20\\n '),\n",

GUY v. HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF\\n     AUGUSTA, GEORGIA.\\n\\n      RICKMAN, Judge.\\n\\n      The issue presented in this appeal is whether the Housing Authority of the City\\n\\nof Augusta, Georgia (“the Authority”) is entitled to assert the privilege of sovereign\\n\\nimmunity in a premises liability action filed by a resident of a low-income housing unit\\n\\noperated by the Authority.1 We conclude that because the Authority is performing an\\n\\nessential public and governmental function on behalf of the City in its operation and\\n\\nmanagement of low-income housing, it is acting as an instrumentality of the City and,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      1\\n        We would like to thank the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, as well as the\\nHousing Authorities of Macon-Bibb County, Georgia; Columbus, Georgia; and the\\nCity of Decatur, Georgia for their helpful and well-written briefs as amici curiae.\\n therefore, is entitled to sovereign immunity. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s\\n\\norder granting summary judgment in favor of the Authority.\\n\\n      Appellant Christina Guy alleges that she was a tenant in a low-income\\n\\napartment complex owned and managed by the Authority when, in November 2021,\\n\\nshe was shot in the leg when several unknown assailants attempted to rob her on the\\n\\nfront porch of her apartment. She filed a premises liability lawsuit against the\\n\\nAuthority, alleging that the Authority was negligent in failing to provide property\\n\\nsecurity and/or take measures to keep the property safe for its residents. The\\n\\nAuthority filed a motion for summary judgment asserting its entitlement to sovereign\\n\\nimmunity. The trial court granted the Authority’s motion upon concluding that it was\\n\\nentitled to sovereign immunity and that its immunity had not been waived.2 This\\n\\nappeal followed.\\n\\n      We review de novo the trial court’s ruling. See McBrayer v. Scarbrough, \\n317 Ga.\\n\\n387\\n, 388 (1) (\\n893 SE2d 660\\n) (2023). In so doing, we recognize that the question of\\n\\nwhether sovereign immunity extends to the Authority is not one that is easily\\n\\n      2\\n       Guy does not meaningfully challenge the trial court’s ruling that there was no\\nwaiver of the Authority’s sovereign immunity. See Hicks v. Newman, \\n283 Ga. App.\\n352\\n, 353 (\\n641 SE2d 589\\n) (2007) (recognizing that a “failure to provide any cogent\\nargument or citation of authority in support of [an] alleged error constitutes waiver”).\\n                                           2\\n answered. But after thoroughly examining the history of the common-law doctrine and\\n\\nthe subsequently ratified constitutional amendments and statutory law, and after\\n\\nanalyzing the purpose for and structure of the Authority, we conclude that it is an\\n\\ninstrumentality of the City such that it is entitled to sovereign immunity.\\n\\n       The doctrine of sovereign immunity has been part of our law for nearly 240\\n\\nyears and at common law, it extended to all levels of government and was extremely\\n\\nbroad. See Gilbert v. Richardson, \\n264 Ga. 744\\n, 745 (1) (\\n452 SE2d 476\\n) (1994) (“The\\n\\ncommon law doctrine of sovereign immunity, adopted by this state in 1784, protected\\n\\ngovernments at all levels from unconsented-to legal actions.”) (footnote omitted); see\\n\\nalso Peeples v. Byrd, \\n98 Ga. 688\\n, 693-694 (4) (\\n25 SE 677\\n) (1896) (“It is hardly\\n\\nnecessary to cite authority for the proposition that a sovereign State is not liable to suit\\n\\nat the instance of a citizen, unless permission to sue has been expressly granted.”).\\n\\nSovereign immunity extended to the State and its departments, agencies, and officers\\n\\nin their official capacities. See Lathrop v. Deal, \\n301 Ga. 408\\n, 413 (II) (A) (\\n801 SE2d\\n\\n867\\n) (2017). Likewise, municipalities performing governmental functions have long\\n\\nbeen afforded the same immunity as that of the State. See Gatto v. City of Statesboro,\\n\\n312 Ga. 164\\n, 166 (1) (\\n860 SE2d 713\\n) (2021) (“As early as 1880, this Court held that\\n\\n\\n                                             3\\n municipalities enjoyed the same immunity as the State in their performance of acts\\n\\nwhich are legislative or judicial in their nature, on the ground that such acts are\\n\\ndeemed to be but the exercise of a part of the state’s power.”) (citation and\\n\\npunctuation omitted).\\n\\n      Within this common-law framework, sovereign immunity was incorporated into\\n\\nthe Georgia Constitution of 1945 by an amendment ratified in 1974.3 See City of College\\n\\nPark v. Clayton County, \\n306 Ga. 301\\n, 305 (1) (a) (\\n830 SE2d 179\\n) (2019). Because the\\n\\nconstitutional provision incorporates a pre-existing right, “the provision cannot be\\n\\nsaid to create that right — it merely secures and protects it.” Elliott v. State, \\n305 Ga.\\n\\n179\\n, 212 (IV) (B) (\\n824 SE2d 265\\n) (2019). “And where the right enshrined in the\\n\\nconstitution was one found at common law, that constitutional right is understood\\n\\nwith reference to the common law, absent some clear textual indication to the\\n\\ncontrary.” \\nId.\\n Consequently, “we must look to the understanding of the common law\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      3\\n         We note that “though the relevant text of our State Constitution regarding\\nsovereign immunity has undergone certain revisions leading up to its current form in\\nthe Georgia Constitution of 1983 as amended in 1991, those provisions generally\\naddress only the waiver of sovereign immunity.” City of College Park, \\n306 Ga. at 305\\n\\n(1) (a).\\n                                           4\\n doctrine of sovereign immunity in Georgia by 1974 — the date at which Georgia gave\\n\\nthe doctrine constitutional status.” City of College Park, \\n306 Ga. at 305\\n (1) (a).\\n\\n      With this history in mind, we turn to the issue of whether the Authority is\\n\\nentitled to the privilege of sovereign immunity. As they did at common law, municipal\\n\\ncorporations4 remain immune from suit under the present constitutional and statutory\\n\\nframework except to the extent that sovereign immunity has been waived by the\\n\\nGeneral Assembly. See Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. IX, Sec. II, Par. IX; OCGA § 36-33-1\\n\\n(a). Indeed, the General Assembly declared that, with few exceptions, “it is the public\\n\\npolicy of the State of Georgia that there is no waiver of the sovereign immunity of\\n\\nmunicipal corporations of the state and such municipal corporations shall be immune\\n\\nfrom liability for damages.” OCGA § 36-33-1 (a).5 And more specifically, “municipal\\n\\ncorporations shall not be liable for failure to perform or for errors in performing their\\n\\n\\n\\n      4\\n        OCGA § 36-30-1 provides that the words “city,” “town,” “municipality,”\\nor “village” shall be construed as synonymous, and that “such words shall be held to\\nmean a municipal corporation as defined by statutory law and judicial interpretation.”\\n      5\\n        OCGA § 36-33-1 (a) further provides that, “[a] municipal corporation shall\\nnot waive its immunity by the purchase of liability insurance, except as provided in\\nCode Section 33-24-51 or 36-92-2, or unless the policy of insurance issued covers an\\noccurrence for which the defense of sovereign immunity is available, and then only to\\nthe extent of the limits of such insurance policy.”\\n                                            5\\n legislative or judicial powers.” OCGA § 36-33-1 (b).6 This Court has also recognized\\n\\nthat sovereign immunity extends, as it did at common law, to instrumentalities of a\\n\\nmunicipal corporation. See Hospital Auth. of Fulton County v. Litterilla, \\n199 Ga. App.\\n\\n345\\n, 346-347 (1) (\\n404 SE2d 796\\n) (1991), overruled on other grounds by Litterilla v.\\n\\nHosp. Auth. of Fulton County, \\n262 Ga. 34\\n (\\n413 SE2d 718\\n) (1992).\\n\\n      The question thus becomes whether the Authority constitutes an\\n\\ninstrumentality of the City of Augusta within the context of sovereign immunity so\\n\\nthat it is entitled to assert the privilege.7 To answer this question, we examine (1) the\\n\\nlegislation creating the Authority, and (2) the public purposes for which it was\\n\\ncreated. See Miller v. Georgia Ports Auth., \\n266 Ga. 586\\n, 587-589 (\\n470 SE2d 426\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\n      6\\n         Municipalities may be liable “[f]or neglect to perform or improper or\\nunskillful performance of their ministerial duties,” OCGA § 36-33-1 (b), but Guy does\\nnot assert liability as to the Authority on the basis that it was negligent in performing\\nministerial duties.\\n      7\\n         The trial court held that the Authority was entitled to sovereign immunity as\\na municipal corporation, an instrumentality of the State of Georgia, and as an\\ninstrumentality of the City. But see Pass v. Athens Housing Auth., \\n368 Ga. App. 445\\n,\\n453 (\\n890 SE2d 342\\n) (2023) (holding that the housing authority was not entitled to\\nsovereign immunity as an instrumentality of the state); Files v. Housing Auth. of City\\nof Douglas, \\n368 Ga. App. 455\\n, 464 (\\n890 SE2d 356\\n) (2023) (same). Because we affirm\\nthe trial court’s order upon our determination that the Authority is an instrumentality\\nof the City, we need not consider the alternative bases for the trial court’s ruling.\\n                                           6\\n (1996); see also Kyle v. Georgia Lottery Corp., \\n290 Ga. 87\\n, 88-91 (1) (\\n718 SE2d 801\\n)\\n\\n(2011).\\n\\n      (1) Housing Authorities in general, and the Authority specifically, were created\\n\\nby the Housing Authorities Law, OCGA § 8-3-1 et seq. (“the Act”), in order to\\n\\nprovide affordable housing for low-income persons. In accordance with the Act, the\\n\\nAuthority was activated by the Mayor and Council of the City of Augusta by a\\n\\nresolution issued in 1937. The Authority is defined in the Act as “a public body\\n\\ncorporate and politic:”\\n\\n      In each city and in each county of the state there is created a public body\\n      corporate and politic to be known as the “housing authority” of the city\\n      or county; provided, however, that such authority shall not transact any\\n      business or exercise its powers under this article until or unless the\\n      governing body of the city or the county, as the case may be, by proper\\n      resolution shall declare at any time hereafter that there is need for an\\n      authority to function in such city or county.\\n\\n\\nOCGA § 8-3-4; see also Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. IX, Sec. II, Para. III (8). The Act\\n\\nfurther provides that the Authority “exercis[es] public and essential governmental\\n\\nfunctions.” OCGA § 8-3-30 (a). And it declares property owned by the Authority to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          7\\n be “public property used for essential public and governmental purposes and not for\\n\\npurposes of private or corporate benefit and income.” OCGA § 8-3-8.\\n\\n      (2) As for its purpose, the General Assembly authorized the creation of the\\n\\nAuthority in order to address the “shortage of safe and sanitary dwelling\\n\\naccommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford” because\\n\\nthat shortage could not be relieved solely “through the operation of private\\n\\nenterprise.” See OCGA § 8-3-2. The legislature, therefore, deemed housing\\n\\nauthorities necessary in order to allow “public money [to] be spent and private\\n\\nproperty acquired” so as to provide housing to low-income persons. See id. The\\n\\nAuthority has the power to condemn property and to use governmental bonds for the\\n\\npurposes of developing low-income housing. See OCGA §§ 8-3-10, 8-3-31, 8-3-70. It\\n\\nis mandated by state law to “manage and operate its housing projects . . . in an\\n\\nefficient manner so as to enable it to fix the rentals for dwelling accommodations for\\n\\npersons of low income at the lowest possible rates.” OCGA § 8-3-11. Property\\n\\nobtained by the Authority “is declared to be public property used for essential public\\n\\nand governmental purposes and not for purposes of private or corporate benefit or\\n\\nincome.” OCGA § 8-3-8. And because the Authority is a public entity serving a\\n\\n\\n                                          8\\n governmental function using public funds, it is “exempt from all taxes and special\\n\\nassessments of the city, the county, and the state or any political subdivision thereof.”\\n\\nId.\\n\\n      As the legislative language and the purpose behind the creation of the Authority\\n\\nboth illustrate, the Authority is a public corporation using public funds to perform for\\n\\nthe City what the General Assembly has deemed to be an essential public and\\n\\ngovernmental purpose. See Miller, 266 Ga. at 587-589. We conclude, therefore,\\n\\nparticularly when viewed in the historical context of our sovereign immunity\\n\\njurisprudence, that the Authority is an instrumentality of the City of Augusta such\\n\\nthat it is entitled to sovereign immunity. See Kyle v. Georgia Lottery Corp., \\n290 Ga. 87\\n,\\n\\n91 (1) (\\n718 SE2d 801\\n) (2011) (holding that the Georgia Lottery Corporation was\\n\\nentitled to sovereign immunity as an instrumentality of the State, in part because “its\\n\\nmain purpose is to generate net proceeds to be used to support improvements and\\n\\nenhancements for educational purposes and programs”); Youngblood v. Gwinnett\\n\\nRockdale Newton Community Service Board, \\n273 Ga. 715\\n, 716 (1) (\\n545 SE2d 875\\n) (2001)\\n\\n(holding that a community service board was entitled to sovereign immunity as an\\n\\nagency of the State because it was created by the General Assembly as a “‘public\\n\\n\\n                                           9\\n agenc[y]’ to govern publicly funded programs which provide mental health, mental\\n\\nretardation, substance abuse, and other disability services” throughout the state);\\n\\nEnglish v. Fulton County Bldg. Auth., \\n266 Ga. App. 583\\n, 586 (1) (\\n597 SE2d 626\\n) (2004)\\n\\n(holding that a county building authority was entitled to sovereign immunity because\\n\\nit was statutorily identified as performing “an essential government function,” was\\n\\ncreated for projects “that primarily benefit the public,” and was judgment proof to the\\n\\nextent that any judgment entered against it would cost taxpayers); see also Culbreth\\n\\nv. Southwest Ga. Regional Housing Auth., \\n199 Ga. 183\\n, 189 (\\n33 SE2d 684\\n) (1945)\\n\\n(holding, with respect to the assessment of ad valorem taxes, that since the housing\\n\\nauthority was a public corporation “using [its] property exclusively for a declared\\n\\npublic and governmental purpose, and not for private or corporate benefit or income,\\n\\nit [was] in effect an instrumentality of the State” and its property was exempt from\\n\\ntaxation). Compare Thomas v. Hospital Auth. of Clarke County, \\n264 Ga. 40\\n, 43 (2) (\\n440\\n\\nSE2d 195\\n) (1994), superceded by statute on other grounds as recognized in Kyle v.\\n\\nGeorgia Lottery Corp., \\n290 Ga. 87\\n (\\n718 SE2d 801\\n) (2011), (noting that the functions\\n\\nperformed by a hospital authority do not entitle it to sovereign immunity because the\\n\\nhospital authority was “in direct competition” with private hospitals and functioning\\n\\n\\n                                          10\\n in “an area of business ordinarily carried on by private enterprise”). Accordingly, we\\n\\naffirm the trial court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Authority on the\\n\\nbasis that it was entitled to sovereign immunity as an instrumentality of the City.\\n\\n      Judgment affirmed.

IN THE MATTER OF PAUL JASON YORK.\\n\\n        PER CURIAM.\\n\\n        This disciplinary matter is before the Court on the report and\\n\\nrecommendation of Special Master Michael J. Blakely, who\\n\\nrecommends that the Court accept the petition for voluntary\\n\\ndiscipline filed by Respondent Paul Jason York (State Bar No.\\n\\n929158) after the filing of a formal complaint, see Bar Rule 4-227 (c),\\n\\nand impose a three-year suspension with conditions, nunc pro tunc\\n\\nto May 1, 2020. In his petition, York, a member of the State Bar of\\n\\nGeorgia since 2014, admitted to violating Rules 1.7 (a), 3.3 (a), 4.1,\\n\\nand 8.4 (a) (4) of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct\\n\\n(“GRPC”), found in Bar Rule 4-102 (d). The maximum sanction for a\\n\\nsingle violation of any of these Rules is disbarment. Neither York\\n\\nnor the Bar filed exceptions in this Court to the Special Master’s\\n report and recommendation. For the reasons discussed below, we\\n\\nreject York’s petition for voluntary discipline.\\n\\n     After the Bar filed a formal complaint, York filed a petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline admitting the allegations against him. A\\n\\ndisciplinary hearing was held on June 16, 2023. In his report, the\\n\\nSpecial Master recounted that York admitted the following facts. In\\n\\nearly 2020, York represented a client who was arrested and charged\\n\\nwith misdemeanor family violence against her husband. She was\\n\\nreleased on bond on the condition that she not contact her husband,\\n\\nbut she was arrested a second time based on an allegation that she\\n\\nhad violated the no-contact condition. Thereafter, she was again\\n\\nreleased on bond with the added conditions that she wear an\\n\\nelectronic monitoring device on her ankle and pay a monthly\\n\\nmonitoring fee of $347.52.\\n\\n     York forged the signatures of a judge and an assistant district\\n\\nattorney on a court order dated March 4, 2020 that purportedly\\n\\nauthorized the removal of the monitoring device from the client’s\\n\\nankle. As a result, he was charged with felony forgery, and he\\n\\n                                   2\\n entered into a 36-month Pretrial Diversion Agreement (“PDA”) with\\n\\nthe district attorney’s office pursuant to OCGA § 15-18-80,1\\n\\nrequiring him, for the duration of the PDA, to (1) refrain from drug\\n\\nand alcohol use; (2) submit to random drug tests; (3) continue\\n\\ncounseling with a psychologist until released; (4) continue\\n\\ncounseling with a substance abuse counselor until released; (5)\\n\\nattend at least one weekly drug/alcohol support group meeting; (6)\\n\\nattend monthly legal mentoring sessions; (7) follow the Bar’s\\n\\nrecommendations; and (8) “not practice law until reinstated by the\\n\\nState Bar of Georgia.”2 The district attorney agreed to dismiss the\\n\\ncriminal charges upon York’s completion of the conditions, but if\\n\\nYork failed to meet those conditions, he could face prosecution.3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     1 A PDA provides “an alternative to prosecuting offenders in the criminal\\n\\njustice system.” OCGA §15-18-80 (b). The Special Master observed that, as a\\nresult of the PDA, the trial court has not entered judgment against or imposed\\na criminal sentence on York.\\n     2 The Special Master found that York voluntarily stopped practicing law\\n\\nin May 2020, about two months after he committed the forgery.\\n     3 The transcript of the disciplinary hearing before the Special Master\\n\\nreflects that York testified that he entered into the PDA on August 8, 2022,\\nand he believes that it will remain in effect until at least August 8, 2025.\\n\\n                                      3\\n      The Special Master observed that York committed the\\n\\nmisconduct at issue here in response to pressure from the client, her\\n\\nfamily and friends, and members of her church to procure the\\n\\nremoval of the monitoring device because the monthly fee caused the\\n\\nclient financial hardship. Moreover, York suffered from serious\\n\\nsubstance abuse and psychological problems at the time he\\n\\ncommitted the misconduct. However, York presented evidence that\\n\\nhe sought and received care from a psychologist, who evaluated him\\n\\nin December 2020 and conducted a follow-up evaluation in\\n\\nSeptember 2021; successfully completed an intensive outpatient\\n\\nprogram; and began to attend weekly counseling sessions with a\\n\\nsubstance abuse counselor. The psychologist opined at the\\n\\ndisciplinary hearing that York’s judgment and mental and\\n\\nemotional functioning had been impaired by his drug addiction,\\n\\nclinical depression, and anxiety, which caused or contributed to his\\n\\nacts of forgery, but as a result of treatment, York was in a state of\\n\\nrecovery and could safely practice law. The Special Master also\\n\\nobserved that evidence was presented that York is mentored by a\\n\\n                                 4\\n state court judge, who believes that York is ready to resume his legal\\n\\ncareer.\\n\\n      The Special Master concluded that York’s admissions in his\\n\\npetition were sufficient to establish violations of Rules 1.7 (a),4 3.3\\n\\n(a),5 4.1,6 and 8.4 (a) (4).7 The Special Master then considered the\\n\\nABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (“ABA Standards”),\\n\\nwhich include (1) the duty violated; (2) the lawyer’s mental state; (3)\\n\\nthe actual or potential injury caused by the misconduct; and (4)\\n\\naggravating or mitigating factors. See In the Matter of Morse, \\n266\\n\\nGa. 652\\n, 653 (\\n470 SE2d 232\\n) (1996). The Special Master observed\\n\\nthat York violated his duty to the legal system by engaging in\\n\\n\\n\\n      4 Rule 1.7 (a) provides that “[a] lawyer shall not represent or continue to\\n\\nrepresent a client if there is a significant risk that the lawyer’s own interests\\nor the lawyer’s duties to another client, a former client, or a third person will\\nmaterially and adversely affect the representation of the client[.]”\\n      5Rule 3.3 (a) provides in relevant part that “[a] lawyer shall not\\nknowingly: (1) make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal[.]”\\n      6 Rule 4.1 (a) provides that “[i]n the course of representing a client a\\n\\nlawyer shall not knowingly: make a false statement of material fact or law to\\na third person[.]”\\n      7 Rule 8.4 (a) (4) provides that it is a violation of the GRPC for a lawyer\\n\\nto “engage in professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\\nmisrepresentation.”\\n\\n                                       5\\n deceptive conduct (i.e., forgery) during legal proceedings, see ABA\\n\\nStandard 6.0; that he did so intentionally; and that his misconduct\\n\\ncaused actual injury to the legal system, the judge, and the assistant\\n\\ndistrict attorney, and potential harm to the client’s criminal case,\\n\\nthough it did not appear that the unapproved removal of the\\n\\nmonitoring device caused the client’s case any actual harm. The\\n\\npresumptive sanction for this type of misconduct is disbarment. See\\n\\nABA Standard 6.11 (disbarment appropriate when lawyer, with\\n\\nintent to deceive a court, makes false statements or submits false\\n\\ndocument and causes serious injury).\\n\\n     In aggravation, the Special Master found that the forgery was\\n\\ndishonest, but noted that York sought no economic benefit for\\n\\nhimself, see ABA Standard 9.22 (b); that he admitted to multiple\\n\\nviolations of the Rules, see ABA Standard 9.22 (d); that he had\\n\\nsubstantial experience in the practice of law, see ABA Standard 9.22\\n\\n(i), because he had been practicing for six years at the time of the\\n\\nmisconduct; and that he had committed illegal conduct, see ABA\\n\\nStandard 9.22 (k).\\n\\n                                  6\\n       In mitigation, the Special Master found the absence of a prior\\n\\ndisciplinary record, see ABA Standard 9.32 (a); full and free\\n\\ndisclosure to the disciplinary board or a cooperative attitude toward\\n\\nproceedings, see ABA Standard 9.32 (e); evidence of good character\\n\\nand reputation in the form of letters attesting to York’s provision of\\n\\npro bono legal assistance in his community, see ABA Standard 9.32\\n\\n(g); imposition of other penalties or sanctions due to York’s criminal\\n\\ncharges, see ABA Standard 9.32 (k)8; and remorse, see ABA\\n\\nStandard 9.32 (l). The Special Master also gave significant\\n\\nmitigating weight to York’s personal or emotional problems, see\\n\\nABA Standard 9.32 (c), because a psychologist had diagnosed him\\n\\nwith ADHD and observed that “cognitive impairment (related to\\n\\ndrug use, depression, anxiety, and burn out) played a major part in\\n\\nhis poor judgment” leading to his misconduct. Finally, the Special\\n\\n\\n\\n      8 We disagree with the Special Master’s application of ABA Standard\\n\\n9.32 (k) because we have held that the imposition of a criminal penalty relating\\nto the same conduct at issue in a disciplinary matter should not be viewed as\\na mitigating factor. See In the Matter of Levin, \\n289 Ga. 170\\n, 175 (\\n709 SE2d 808\\n)\\n(2011), citing In the Matter of Ortman, \\n289 Ga. 130\\n, 131-132 (\\n709 SE2d 784\\n)\\n(2011) (Nahmias, J., concurring).\\n\\n                                       7\\n Master gave significant weight to the mitigating factor of “mental\\n\\ndisability or substance abuse problem,” see ABA Standard 9.32 (i),9\\n\\nbecause although York suffered from drug abuse and psychological\\n\\nproblems at the time of his misconduct, he had shown significant\\n\\nevidence of recovery. Specifically, the Special Master recited that in\\n\\nhis 2020 evaluation, the psychologist found that at the time of his\\n\\nmisconduct, York was abusing his ADHD medications and\\n\\nmethamphetamine, which “likely caused him to be adept at\\n\\ndishonesty, shading the truth and covering up mistakes and\\n\\nwrongdoing.” However, in his 2021 evaluation, the psychologist\\n\\nnoted that York “has been very involved in a milieu of treatments to\\n\\n\\n\\n     9 ABA Standard 9.32 (i) provides that an attorney’s “mental disability or\\n\\nchemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse” can be considered\\nmitigating when\\n     (1) there is medical evidence that the respondent is affected by a\\n     chemical dependency or mental disability;\\n     (2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the\\n     misconduct;\\n     (3) the respondent’s recovery from the chemical dependency or\\n     mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained\\n     period of successful rehabilitation; and\\n     (4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of that\\n     misconduct is unlikely.\\n\\n                                     8\\n improve his health and functioning”; that his mood and cognitive\\n\\nfunctioning had improved; that he had not relapsed; and that his\\n\\n“drug/alcohol problems are in remission.”\\n\\n     The Special Master observed that in Georgia, an attorney’s\\n\\nsubmission of fabricated documents is a serious offense that may\\n\\njustify disbarment. Cf. In the Matter of Manning-Wallace, \\n287 Ga.\\n\\n223\\n, 224 (\\n695 SE2d 237\\n) (2010) (Nahmias, J. concurring). However,\\n\\nmitigating factors may support a suspension even where the offense\\n\\nwould justify disbarment, such as an attorney’s demonstration of a\\n\\nsustained recovery from the substance abuse that led to his\\n\\nmisconduct. See In the Matter of Adams, \\n291 Ga. 173\\n (\\n729 SE2d 313\\n)\\n\\n(2012) (accepting petition for voluntary discipline and imposing\\n\\npublic reprimand, on special master’s recommendation, for attorney\\n\\nwho violated numerous provisions of the GRPC, but showed that his\\n\\nmisconduct was caused in part by substance abuse, from which he\\n\\nhad undergone significant rehabilitation and was maintaining his\\n\\nrecovery); In the Matter of Jaconetti, \\n291 Ga. 772\\n (\\n732 SE2d 447\\n)\\n\\n(2012) (attorney’s misconduct was mitigated by the fact that it was\\n\\n                                 9\\n likely attributable to his mental illness and severe emotional\\n\\ndistress; three-year suspension for multiple violations, including\\n\\nRule 8.4 (a) (4)). The Special Master noted that York had\\n\\ndemonstrated significant mitigating factors, and he had taken\\n\\nconcrete steps to overcome his substance abuse problem and address\\n\\nhis psychological issues, resulting in improved cognitive functioning\\n\\nand a “remission” of his addiction.\\n\\n     To be sure, the Special Master acknowledged that in Manning-\\n\\nWallace, this Court rejected an attorney’s petition for voluntary\\n\\ndiscipline requesting a Review Panel reprimand when the attorney\\n\\noffered fabricated insurance documents into evidence in a case on\\n\\nher own behalf, rather than on behalf of a client; moreover, she\\n\\ninitially denied that the documents had been fabricated or that she\\n\\nhad offered them into evidence. Id. at 224. See also In the Matter of\\n\\nDogan, \\n282 Ga. 783\\n (\\n653 SE2d 690\\n) (2007) (disbarring attorney who\\n\\nproduced fabricated pay stubs in child support case against him,\\n\\nwith the intent to deceive the other party; no mitigating factors). But\\n\\nthe Special Master attempted to distinguish the facts of this case by\\n\\n                                  10\\n noting that York submitted the forged order on behalf of his client,\\n\\nnot himself; he did not attempt to mislead the Bar or the Special\\n\\nMaster; he admitted to the factual allegations and Rule violations;\\n\\nand there were significant mitigating factors. The Special Master\\n\\nopined that although York forged the signatures with the intent to\\n\\ndeceive, his only possible selfish motivation would have been to\\n\\nrelieve himself of the pressure from his client and her supporters.\\n\\nThe Special Master stated that in forging the signatures, York was\\n\\nnot seeking financial gain; he was not consciously seeking to harm\\n\\nanyone; and he acknowledged the harmful nature of his conduct.\\n\\n     The Special Master thus recommended that the Court accept\\n\\nYork’s petition and impose a three-year suspension with the\\n\\nfollowing conditions during the suspension: (1) compliance with the\\n\\nterms of the PDA; (2) attending counseling with the psychologist and\\n\\nwith the substance abuse counselor, weekly support group meetings,\\n\\nand monthly legal mentoring meetings; and (3) as preconditions to\\n\\nreinstatement, (a) obtaining a certification from a medical doctor or\\n\\npsychologist that he is fit to practice law and that his emotional and\\n\\n                                 11\\n substance abuse problems have been addressed, (b) providing proof\\n\\nthat he is in compliance with the PDA, and (c) providing proof that\\n\\nhe complied with his obligations to attend counseling and support\\n\\nmeetings pursuant to the second condition. Moreover, the Special\\n\\nMaster noted that if York is convicted of a crime arising from the\\n\\nsame facts as this disciplinary matter, the Bar may seek all\\n\\ndisciplinary sanctions authorized by the Bar Rules, including\\n\\ndisbarment. The Special Master concluded that, subject to York’s\\n\\ncompliance with the conditions for reinstatement, it would be\\n\\nappropriate for the suspension to be imposed nunc pro tunc to May\\n\\n1, 2020, the date York stopped practicing law, because York provided\\n\\na letter from his former law partner (who is also his father)\\n\\nregarding his efforts to withdraw from all of his cases by May 2020,\\n\\nand a letter from the clerk of court in the county where he primarily\\n\\npracticed indicating that he had not filed any court documents since\\n\\nMay 2020. See In the Matter of Onipede, \\n288 Ga. 156\\n, 157 (\\n702 SE2d\\n\\n136\\n) (2010) (“[W]hen an attorney requests [discipline] nunc pro tunc,\\n\\nit is the lawyer’s responsibility to demonstrate that [he] voluntarily\\n\\n                                 12\\n stopped practicing law, the date on which [his] law practice ended,\\n\\nand that [he] complied with all the ethical obligations implicated in\\n\\nsuch a decision, such as assisting clients in securing new counsel\\n\\nand facilitating the transfer of client files and critical information\\n\\nabout ongoing cases to new counsel.”).\\n\\n     We commend the Special Master for his thorough analysis of\\n\\nthe facts and issues in this case. We disagree, however, with the\\n\\nrecommendation to accept York’s petition while his criminal forgery\\n\\ncharges remain pending. Although we recognize that a pretrial\\n\\ndiversion agreement is considered an “alternative to prosecution,”\\n\\nsee OCGA § 15-18-80 (b), the prosecution remains open during the\\n\\npendency of the PDA, and York has admitted that his PDA will not\\n\\nexpire until at least August 8, 2025, see n.3, supra. If we were to\\n\\naccept York’s petition, he would be eligible to have his three-year\\n\\nsuspension imposed nunc pro tunc to May 1, 2020, the date on which\\n\\nhe offered evidence that he stopped practicing law, and he would be\\n\\neligible for reinstatement because more than three years have\\n\\npassed since that date. But if he were permitted to resume practicing\\n\\n                                 13\\n law before the PDA expires, “the public is likely to lose respect for\\n\\nthe legal system,” just as it would if an attorney were permitted to\\n\\nresume the practice of law while serving criminal probation. In the\\n\\nMatter of Paine, \\n280 Ga. 208\\n, 210 (\\n625 SE2d 768\\n) (2006). The same\\n\\nreasoning applies when felony charges remain pending, albeit under\\n\\na pretrial diversion agreement.\\n\\n     Moreover, we have previously found it appropriate to impose\\n\\nan interim or emergency suspension on an attorney pending the\\n\\nresolution of his or her felony charges. See, e.g., In the Matter of\\n\\nMorris, \\n298 Ga. 864\\n, 864-865 (\\n785 SE2d 4087\\n) (2016) (granting\\n\\nattorney’s voluntary petition for emergency suspension pending the\\n\\nresolution of his disciplinary and criminal matters); In the Matter of\\n\\nSmith, \\n297 Ga. 46\\n, 46 (\\n771 SE2d 901\\n) (2015) (granting attorney’s\\n\\npetition for indefinite suspension pending the outcome of felony\\n\\ntheft by conversion and forgery charges arising from attorney’s\\n\\nrepresentation of civil clients; State Bar observed that attorney’s\\n\\nrequest “strikes a reasonable balance between the need for public\\n\\nprotection and [attorney’s] right to defend against the criminal\\n\\n                                  14\\n charges”); In the Matter of Galette, \\n292 Ga. 341\\n (\\n737 SE2d 691\\n)\\n\\n(2013) (granting attorney’s request for suspension of license pending\\n\\nthe resolution of criminal charges, the underlying facts of which\\n\\nwere related to a grievance filed with the State Bar by the attorney’s\\n\\nclient); In the Matter of Swank, \\n288 Ga. 479\\n (\\n704 SE2d 807\\n) (2011)\\n\\n(granting lawyer’s voluntary petition for a suspension pending the\\n\\nresolution of his felony criminal charges). Although York voluntarily\\n\\nceased practicing law, thereby obviating a need for the Bar to seek\\n\\nan emergency suspension, a similar rationale in protecting the\\n\\npublic applies to not permitting York to resume practicing law while\\n\\nthe charges remain unresolved.\\n\\n     For these reasons, we conclude that York’s proposed discipline\\n\\nis insufficient because it would be inappropriate to impose his\\n\\nrequested three-year suspension nunc pro tunc under the\\n\\ncircumstances of this case. Accordingly, we reject York’s petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline. See generally In the Matter of Veach, \\n310 Ga.\\n\\n470\\n, 472 (\\n851 SE2d 590\\n) (2020) (noting Court’s practice, when\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 15\\n finding proposed discipline insufficient, of rejecting a petition for\\n\\nvoluntary discipline rather than imposing a greater sanction).\\n\\n     Petition for voluntary discipline rejected.

BAKER v. THE STATE.\\n\\n\\n       PETERSON, Presiding Justice.\\n\\n       Kenneth Lee Baker appeals his convictions for malice murder\\n\\nand possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime for the\\n\\nfatal shootings of his wife, Lynnale Baker, and stepdaughter,\\n\\nShaelinda Sanders.1 He argues that the evidence was insufficient to\\n\\n\\n       1 The victims were found dead on May 17, 2010. On February 8, 2011, a\\n\\nSpalding County grand jury returned an indictment charging Baker with two\\ncounts of malice murder, two counts of felony murder, possession of a firearm\\nduring the commission of a crime, and possession of a firearm by a convicted\\nfelon. At a trial that took place in September 2011, a jury found Baker guilty\\non all charges except the felon-in-possession charge, which was not submitted\\nto the jury. On the State’s motion, the trial court then entered an order of nolle\\nprosequi of the felon-in-possession charge. On September 14, 2011, the trial\\ncourt imposed four consecutive life-without-parole sentences for the malice\\nmurder and felony murder counts, along with a consecutive five-year sentence\\nfor possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. A consent order\\nentered on September 27, 2011, amended that sentence to state that the felony\\nmurder counts “merged” into the malice murder counts “[b]y operation of law”;\\na final disposition form filed in 2022 properly described the felony murder\\ncounts as “vacated” and imposed two consecutive life sentences with the\\npossibility of parole for the malice murder counts, along with a consecutive\\n support his conviction, that the trial court plainly erred by failing to\\n\\ngive a jury charge on impeachment for bias, and that the trial court\\n\\nabused its discretion by admitting into evidence certain autopsy\\n\\nphotos and a notebook found in his truck. We conclude that the\\n\\nevidence was sufficient both as a matter of constitutional due\\n\\nprocess and Georgia statutory law, that the trial court did not\\n\\nplainly err in failing to give an instruction on impeachment for bias,\\n\\nand that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\\n\\nphotos and notebook. We affirm.\\n\\n      1.    Baker argues that the evidence was insufficient to\\n\\nsupport his convictions, both as a matter of federal due process and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfive-year sentence for possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.\\nOn September 14, 2011, trial counsel filed a motion for new trial, which was\\namended by new counsel on December 15, 2021. On September 29, 2022,\\nfollowing a hearing, the trial court entered an order denying the motion for\\nnew trial. Motion-for-new-trial counsel filed a notice of appeal to the Court of\\nAppeals on October 28, 2022. The Court of Appeals transferred the case to this\\nCourt on April 11, 2023. On June 2, 2023, this Court remanded the case to the\\ntrial court for consideration of whether motion-for-new-trial counsel should be\\npermitted or required to withdraw given a concern about his current licensure\\nstatus due to noncompliance with continuing education requirements. Baker\\nwas assigned new appellate counsel on remand. New appellate counsel filed an\\namended notice of appeal on October 13, 2023. The case was docketed to this\\nCourt’s April 2024 term and submitted for a decision on the briefs.\\n                                       2\\n Georgia statutory law. We disagree.\\n\\n     When evaluating the legal sufficiency of evidence, we view the\\n\\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdicts and inquire\\n\\nwhether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty\\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\\n\\n319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979). “Under this review, we must\\n\\nput aside any questions about conflicting evidence, the credibility of\\n\\nwitnesses, or the weight of the evidence, leaving the resolution of\\n\\nsuch things to the discretion of the trier of fact.” Mims v. State, 304\\n\\nGa. 851, 853 (1) (a) (823 SE2d 325) (2019) (citation and punctuation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     Applying this standard, the evidence presented at trial showed\\n\\nthe following. In the spring of 2010, Baker and Lynnale were in the\\n\\nprocess of getting divorced. They were living in Griffin in Spalding\\n\\nCounty with Shaelinda, who was a high school senior, and their\\n\\nmiddle-school-aged son, K.B. A separation agreement provided that\\n\\nLynnale was to be awarded the house in the divorce.\\n\\n     K.B. testified that on May 16, 2010, he and his mother had\\n\\n                                  3\\n spent the night at his aunt’s home in College Park. At 5:39 a.m. on\\n\\nMay 17, 2010, Lynnale sent Baker’s cell phone a sexually suggestive\\n\\ntext message, apparently intended for someone else. Lynnale\\n\\ndropped K.B. off at school and proceeded to the Griffin residence to\\n\\nsee Shaelinda, according to K.B. Lynnale’s phone called Baker’s\\n\\nphone around 9:00 a.m., and records show the call lasted two\\n\\nminutes and twenty-one seconds.\\n\\n     Phone records showed that at 11:16 a.m., Baker’s cell phone,\\n\\npinging off a cell tower in Tallapoosa, attempted a call to the phone\\n\\nof Baker’s father, Randolph Young. Records showed that, twelve\\n\\nminutes later, Young’s phone received a call of six minutes and\\n\\nthirty-one seconds in duration from a pay phone located in\\n\\nTallapoosa, which is about two hours from Griffin. According to\\n\\nYoung’s testimony, Baker called around 11:00 a.m. or 11:15 a.m. and\\n\\nsaid he “had shot Lynnale and the girl” and was “going to kill\\n\\nhimself.” Young testified that Baker asked Young to pick K.B. up\\n\\nfrom school. Young testified that he had never been to Baker’s house\\n\\nand they had little in common.\\n\\n                                  4\\n      In response to a call from Young, law enforcement proceeded to\\n\\nthe Griffin residence, which was locked and showed no sign of forced\\n\\nentry. There they found both Lynnale and Shaelinda inside a locked\\n\\nbedroom, shot to death. Baker was suspected of the crimes, and law\\n\\nenforcement placed lookouts on him and his vehicle.\\n\\n     In late July 2010, Andre Adams saw Baker on the America’s\\n\\nMost Wanted television show and recalled seeing Baker’s “black\\n\\ntruck with a Georgia tag on it” at a park in Shreveport, Louisiana\\n\\non July 27, 2010. Adams returned to the park on August 3, 2010,\\n\\nsaw Baker and his truck, and called 911. Adams testified that he\\n\\noverheard Baker mumbling, “I messed my life up; I shouldn’t have .\\n\\n. . done that.” Baker was arrested at the park that day in a Mazda\\n\\npickup truck. He volunteered to an arresting officer that there was\\n\\nnot a gun in his truck. He asked an officer to check on his son and\\n\\nexpressed concerns over whether K.B. “was strong enough to handle\\n\\nwhat he knew.”\\n\\n     Pursuant to a consent-to-search form signed by Baker, law\\n\\nenforcement searched Baker’s truck and found divorce papers and a\\n\\n                                 5\\n notebook. The first page in the notebook began with the statement,\\n\\n“My name is Kenneth Lee Baker,” and included Baker’s address and\\n\\nnames and some contact information for various people, including\\n\\nBaker’s father and children. The notebook included apologies and\\n\\nrequests for forgiveness and statements indicating the writer no\\n\\nlonger wished to live, but did not clearly reference Lynnale,\\n\\nShaelinda, or any shootings or murders. Referencing K.B., the\\n\\nwriter said, “My father has temp custody of him for now.” The\\n\\nnotebook included a list of assets, including a “1995 Mazda Pickup.”\\n\\nOne page included the words, “Kenneth Baker last will” and another\\n\\nthe words, “I don’t want to live anymore I am sorry for all that I have\\n\\ndone. Kenny Baker 8-3-10 No more pain.”\\n\\n     Testifying in his own defense at trial, Baker said that he spent\\n\\nthe night before the shootings at the Griffin residence with\\n\\nShaelinda, but was not present for the shootings. He testified that\\n\\nhe could not remember where he went after he left the house that\\n\\nmorning. Baker said he spoke to Lynnale on the telephone on the\\n\\nmorning of the shootings and he understood that she was going to\\n\\n                                  6\\n Griffin. Baker also said he spoke to K.B. around 8:00 a.m. or 8:30\\n\\na.m. that morning and K.B. had not been dropped off at school.\\n\\nBaker said he was not sure whether he called Young the morning of\\n\\nthe shootings, testifying that his phone had been broken. Baker\\n\\nclaimed that he did not have any relationship with Young, they did\\n\\nnot get along at all, and that previous attempts for Baker to live with\\n\\nYoung had failed, including after Baker had been released from a\\n\\nprevious incarceration for his assault on the mother of one of his\\n\\nchildren. Baker testified that Young hated Baker “so much that he\\n\\ngot up [t]here and lied” to the jury about Baker calling that day.\\n\\n     Applying the Jackson v. Virginia constitutional sufficiency\\n\\nstandard cited above, we conclude that the evidence admitted at\\n\\ntrial was sufficient to authorize the jury’s verdict on the malice\\n\\nmurder counts. Baker argues essentially that the State did not prove\\n\\nthat he was the person who shot his wife and stepdaughter. But\\n\\namong other evidence, the State presented evidence that Baker\\n\\nconfessed to Young that he had shot Lynnale and Shaelinda and\\n\\nasked Young to pick up K.B. from school, prompting Young to call\\n\\n                                  7\\n the police. The scene encountered by law enforcement, who\\n\\nconducted a welfare check at Baker’s home, showed that Lynnale\\n\\nand Shaelinda had in fact been shot.\\n\\n     The record also contains various pieces of evidence of Baker’s\\n\\nconsciousness of guilt, including his departure from the Griffin area\\n\\nin the wake of the violent deaths of his wife and stepdaughter,\\n\\nremarks by Baker in a notebook found in his truck in which he\\n\\noffered general apologies and said that he did “not want to live\\n\\nanymore[,]” and the testimony by the tipster in Shreveport\\n\\nregarding Baker’s statements that he had “messed [his] life up” and\\n\\n“shouldn’t have . . . done that.” See Renner v. State, 260 Ga. 515, 517\\n\\n(3) (a) (397 SE2d 683) (1990) (evidence authorized a finding by the\\n\\njury that defendant’s departure from the state following death of\\n\\nvictim “was occasioned by a consciousness of guilt”); see also Bostic\\n\\nv. State, 294 Ga. 845, 848 (2) (757 SE2d 59) (2014) (testimony of\\n\\nfellow inmate of defendant regarding statements by defendant that\\n\\nshowed consciousness of guilt was admissible as admissions of a\\n\\nparty opponent).\\n\\n                                  8\\n      Baker claims that he had an alibi — that he had left his home\\n\\nand was driving “toward I-20” on his way to Louisiana on the\\n\\nmorning of the shootings — and relies almost exclusively on his own\\n\\ntestimony in support. But Baker professed a lack of recollection as\\n\\nto some of his actions on the morning of the shooting; that testimony\\n\\nmay itself support an inference of guilt if it were disbelieved by the\\n\\njury, given the other evidence of Baker’s guilt. See Mims v. State,\\n\\n310 Ga. 853, 855 (854 SE2d 742) (2021) (defendant’s testimony “may\\n\\nitself be considered substantive evidence of guilt when disbelieved\\n\\nby the jury, as long as some corroborative evidence exists for the\\n\\ncharged offense”). To the extent Baker relies on cell phone records\\n\\nshowing that he was driving on I-20 near Tallapoosa before his\\n\\nsignal was lost, the relevant evidence showed that police began\\n\\ntracking Baker’s location after the shootings in hopes of locating\\n\\nhim. Baker points to no evidence excluding the possibility that he\\n\\nwas at the Griffin home at the time of the shootings.\\n\\n     Baker also appears to argue that the evidence was insufficient\\n\\nas a matter of Georgia statutory law. He cites OCGA § 24-8-823,\\n\\n                                  9\\n arguing that his alleged confession to Young was not sufficiently\\n\\ncorroborated. Under OCGA § 24-8-823 and its predecessor statute,\\n\\nOCGA § 24-3-53: “All admissions shall be scanned with care, and\\n\\nconfessions of guilt shall be received with great caution. A confession\\n\\nalone, uncorroborated by any other evidence, shall not justify a\\n\\nconviction.”2 Corroboration of a confession “in any particular”\\n\\nsatisfied the requirements of former OCGA § 24-3-53. See Sands v.\\n\\nState, 262 Ga. 367, 367 (1) (418 SE2d 55) (1992). Here, Baker’s\\n\\nconfession to Young was corroborated by various evidence cited\\n\\nabove, including the circumstances under which the victims were\\n\\ndiscovered and the various evidence of Baker’s consciousness of\\n\\nguilt. See id. at 367-368 (1) (OCGA § 24-3-53 satisfied where trial\\n\\ntestimony corroborated defendant’s confession as to the defendant’s\\n\\npresence at the location of the murder, the means by which the\\n\\nvictim was killed, and the location where the victim’s body was\\n\\n\\n      2 OCGA § 24-8-823 was carried forward from OCGA § 24-3-53 of the\\n\\nformer Evidence Code, which governed Baker’s 2011 trial. See Thomas v. State,\\n308 Ga. 26, 30 (2) (b) n.4 (838 SE2d 801) (2020). There is no specific corollary\\nto this rule in the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Ronald L. Carlson & Michael\\nScott Carlson, Carlson on Evidence 635 (9th ed. 2024).\\n                                      10\\n found).3\\n\\n      Regarding sufficiency generally, Baker argues that it was not\\n\\nestablished that he was the author of the writings in the notebook\\n\\nor that the notebook referenced the shootings. To the extent that this\\n\\nsufficiency argument implicates his argument that the notebook was\\n\\nimproperly admitted for lack of authentication, we consider even\\n\\nerroneously admitted evidence in determining sufficiency, see Glenn\\n\\nv. State, 306 Ga. 550, 553 (2) n.3 (832 SE2d 433) (2019), and, at any\\n\\nrate, as discussed below, we ultimately reject his argument that the\\n\\nnotebook was improperly admitted. To the extent that the\\n\\nexpressions of guilt in the notebook were not clearly referring to the\\n\\nshootings, that was for the jury to consider. Baker has not shown\\n\\nthat the evidence was insufficient to sustain his malice murder or\\n\\n\\n\\n      3 Baker’s primary brief to this Court does not cite OCGA § 24-14-6, which\\n\\nprovides that where a conviction is based on circumstantial evidence, “the\\nproved facts shall not only be consistent with the hypothesis of guilt, but shall\\nexclude every other reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt of the\\naccused[,]” or its predecessor in the former Evidence Code, former OCGA § 24-\\n4-6. To the extent that he attempts to raise a claim under OCGA § 24-4-6, it\\nalso fails. See Blevins v. State, 291 Ga. 814, 816 (733 SE2d 744) (2012) (whether\\nan alternative hypothesis was a reasonable one under OCGA § 24-4-6 was a\\nprincipally a question for the jury).\\n                                       11\\n firearms convictions as a matter of constitutional due process or\\n\\nGeorgia statutory law.\\n\\n     2.   Baker argues that the trial court plainly erred by failing\\n\\nto charge the jury on impeachment of Young based on Young’s bias\\n\\nor motive to lie. We disagree.\\n\\n     Baker concedes that he did not preserve for ordinary appellate\\n\\nreview an objection to the trial court’s failure to give an instruction\\n\\non impeachment for bias or motive and therefore this claim is\\n\\nsubject to review only for plain error. See State v. Kelly, 290 Ga. 29,\\n\\n32 (1) (718 SE2d 232) (2011) (establishing plain-error review for\\n\\nunpreserved jury instruction claims). This Court established the\\n\\nfollowing test for determining whether there is plain error in jury\\n\\ninstructions under OCGA § 17-8-58 (b):\\n\\n     First, there must be an error or defect — some sort of\\n     deviation from a legal rule — that has not been\\n     intentionally    relinquished     or    abandoned,     i.e.,\\n     affirmatively waived, by the appellant. Second, the legal\\n     error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to\\n     reasonable dispute. Third, the error must have affected\\n     the appellant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary\\n     case means he must demonstrate that it affected the\\n     outcome of the trial court proceedings. Fourth and finally,\\n\\n                                  12\\n      if the above three prongs are satisfied, the appellate court\\n     has the discretion to remedy the error — discretion which\\n     ought to be exercised only if the error seriously affects the\\n     fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\\n     proceedings.\\n\\nKelly, 290 Ga. at 33 (2) (a) (citation and punctuation omitted;\\n\\nemphasis in original). If one prong of the plain error test is not\\n\\nsatisfied, we need not address the other prongs of the test. See id. at\\n\\n34 (2) (b) n.5. Satisfying this high standard “is difficult, as it should\\n\\nbe.” Id. at 33 (2) (a) (citation and punctuation omitted).\\n\\n     Here, Baker has not shown that it was obvious that the trial\\n\\ncourt should have given an instruction on impeachment of a witness\\n\\nfor bias based on evidence about Baker’s estranged relationship with\\n\\nYoung. The trial court instructed the jury on its duty to determine\\n\\nthe credibility and believability of witnesses. In particular, in its\\n\\npreliminary instructions to the jury, the trial court instructed the\\n\\njury that in determining the credibility or believability of the\\n\\nwitnesses, the jury might consider, among other things, the\\n\\nwitnesses’ “interest or lack of interest in the case[.]”And in its final\\n\\ncharge to the jury, the trial court instructed the jury that in\\n\\n                                   13\\n determining witness credibility the jury might consider “all of the\\n\\nfacts and circumstances of the case, the manner in which the witness\\n\\ntestifies, their means and opportunity for knowing the facts about\\n\\nwhich they testify, the nature of the facts about which they testify,\\n\\nthe probability or improbability of their testimony and the\\n\\noccurrences about which they testify[,]” as well as “their personal\\n\\ncredibility insofar as it may have been shown in your presence and\\n\\nby the evidence.” We have said that even assuming there was slight\\n\\nevidence supporting a charge on impeachment of a witness through\\n\\nbias toward a party, a charge asking jurors to consider a witness’s\\n\\n“interest or lack of interest in the outcome of the case” substantially\\n\\ncovered the omitted charge on bias such that there was no error in\\n\\ndeclining to give the additional charge. See Isaac v. State, 2024 WL\\n\\n2138181, at *7 (3) (Case No. S24A0014, decided May 14, 2024).\\n\\nAlthough the trial court here omitted the “interest or lack of\\n\\ninterest” language from its final charge to the jury, the court did\\n\\ninstruct the jury in its preliminary instructions that it was proper\\n\\nto consider a witness’s interest or lack of interest in the case in\\n\\n                                  14\\n determining the witness’s credibility. And Baker has not pointed to\\n\\nany binding case law showing that an additional instruction on bias\\n\\nwas required on this record, and we have not found any. Thus, Baker\\n\\nhas not shown that the failure to give an instruction on bias\\n\\namounted to plain error. See Simmons v. State, 314 Ga. 883, 889-\\n\\n890 (2) (a) (880 SE2d 125) (2022) (no clear or obvious error where\\n\\nappellant did not point to any authority that additional charge was\\n\\nrequired).\\n\\n     3.      Baker argues that the trial court erred by admitting\\n\\ncertain autopsy photos. We disagree.\\n\\n     During the medical examiner’s testimony, the trial court\\n\\nadmitted several pre-incision autopsy photos over Baker’s objections\\n\\nthat they were cumulative and were “probably meant to inflame\\n\\nmore than anything else” because they showed Lynnale’s breasts\\n\\nand pubic area in addition to gunshot wounds. The medical\\n\\nexaminer testified that these photos were taken in the course of\\n\\nstandard procedure in an effort to address questions such as range\\n\\nof fire and bullet trajectories. He also testified that when a photo\\n\\n                                 15\\n displays the breasts or sexual organs of a victim, that is because\\n\\nwhat is shown bears some relevance to the victim’s wounds.\\n\\n      Baker argues that “[t]he prejudicial effect of these photos\\n\\noutweighed any alleged probative value and should have been\\n\\nexcluded by the trial court” because “[r]reasonable jurors’ passions\\n\\nwould have been inflamed upon viewing these exhibits and weighing\\n\\nthe evidence against Baker[.]” The former Evidence Code did not\\n\\nhave a provision providing for the exclusion of evidence when it was\\n\\nmore prejudicial than probative, but we limited the admissibility of\\n\\npost-incision autopsy photos given the potential for prejudice and\\n\\nconfusion. See Brown v. State, 250 Ga. 862, 866-867 (5) (302 SE2d\\n\\n347) (1983), abrogated by the current Evidence Code as stated in\\n\\nVenturino v. State, 306 Ga. 391, 395-396 (2) (b) (890 SE2d 110)\\n\\n(2019).4 Nonetheless, our former Evidence Code case law was clear\\n\\nthat a trial court generally did not abuse its discretion in admitting\\n\\n\\n      4 Of course, OCGA § 24-4-403 now specifically provides that “[r]elevant\\n\\nevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\\nthe danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\\nor by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\\ncumulative evidence.”\\n                                      16\\n pre-incision autopsy photos showing the location and nature of a\\n\\nvictim’s wounds, even if they were duplicative, even if they might\\n\\n“inflame” the jury, and even if the cause of death was not in dispute.\\n\\nSee, e.g., Johnson v. State, 289 Ga. 106, 107-108 (2) (709 SE2d 768)\\n\\n(2011). Although the three autopsy photos that Baker challenges on\\n\\nappeal included Lynnale’s breast or pubic area, they also show the\\n\\nlocation of her wounds, and we cannot say that the trial court abused\\n\\nits discretion by admitting these photos. See, e.g., id. at 108 (2) (trial\\n\\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting pre-incision autopsy\\n\\nphotographs into evidence); Miller v. State, 277 Ga. 707, 709 (2) (593\\n\\nSE2d 659) (2004) (no abuse of discretion when trial court admitted\\n\\npre-incision autopsy pictures depicting the location and nature of\\n\\nthe victim’s wounds); Rucker v. State, 270 Ga. 431, 433-434 (4) (510\\n\\nSE2d 816) (1999) (no error in admitting pre-incision autopsy\\n\\nphotograph showing that a bra stay infiltrating a gunshot wound).\\n\\n     4.     Finally, Baker argues that the trial court abused its\\n\\ndiscretion by admitting the notebook taken from his truck. We\\n\\ndisagree.\\n\\n                                   17\\n       Baker argues that the notebook should not have been admitted\\n\\nbecause the State did not establish that the writing was his. 5 Under\\n\\nthe former Evidence Code, our case law provided that the genuine\\n\\nnature of a letter or note may be proved by circumstantial evidence\\n\\nand need not be authenticated by a handwriting expert. See Johnson\\n\\nv. State, 273 Ga. 872, 873 (1) (548 SE2d 292) (2001). 6 Here, Baker’s\\n\\nnotebook was authenticated by both its contents and the location in\\n\\nwhich it was found. The writing within the notebook began with the\\n\\nstatement, “My name is Kenneth Lee Baker”; included Baker’s\\n\\naddress along with the names and contact information for Baker’s\\n\\nfamily, including the phone number listed for Young that Baker\\n\\ncalled on the morning of the shooting; listed assets, including the\\n\\n“1995 Mazda Pickup” — the same type of vehicle from which the\\n\\nnotebook was collected; and included a page signed by “Kenny\\n\\n\\n      5 Baker notes that he also raised a chain-of-custody objection at trial.\\n\\nBut he offers no argument in support of such an objection on appeal, so it is\\nabandoned. See former Supreme Court Rule 22 (“Any enumerated error not\\nsupported by argument or citation of authority in the brief shall be deemed\\nabandoned.”).\\n      6  The current Evidence Code now contains a comprehensive\\nauthentication statute that is nearly identical to a federal rule. See OCGA 24-\\n9-901; Nicholson v. State, 307 Ga. 466, 476 (5) n.6 (837 SE2d 362) (2019).\\n                                      18\\n Baker” and dated “8-3-10[.]” And the notebook was found in Baker’s\\n\\nvehicle. Although Baker points to factual differences between his\\n\\ncase and the authentication case law cited by the State, we cannot\\n\\nsay that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling Baker’s\\n\\nauthentication objection and admitting the notebook. See Foster v.\\n\\nState, 294 Ga. 383, 384-385 (3) (754 SE2d 33) (2014) (circumstances\\n\\nwere sufficient to make prima facie showing of authenticity of letter\\n\\nputatively written by the defendant where the letter referenced the\\n\\nrecipient’s relatives and friends, discussed the pending charges,\\n\\ncontained the defendant’s jail cell number, and was signed by an\\n\\nalias of the defendant, and the recipient testified that she knew that\\n\\nit was from the defendant “based on the names and the content of\\n\\nthe letter”); Arevalo v. State, 275 Ga. 392, 395-396 (5) (567 SE2d 303)\\n\\n(2002) (citing contents of a letter, in addition to other circumstances,\\n\\nin concluding that circumstances were sufficient to make a prima\\n\\nfacie showing of the writing’s authenticity); State v.

GONZALEZ v. MILLER.\\n\\n      BARNES, Presiding Judge.\\n\\n      In March 2023, Jarrod Miller, a resident of Athens-Clarke County, filed an\\n\\napplication for writ of mandamus, as amended, in which he challenged Deborah\\n\\nGonzalez’s performance of her statutory duties as the Western Judicial Circuit\\n\\nDistrict Attorney, which includes Athens-Clarke County.1 Gonzalez moved to dismiss\\n\\nthe application for lack of standing and failure to state a claim. Following a hearing,\\n\\nand upon finding that Miller had standing to pursue a writ of mandamus, and also\\n\\nconcluding that, if true, the allegations in the application regarding Gonzalez’s policy\\n\\n\\n      1\\n       The Court thanks the District Attorneys’ Association of Georgia and the\\ngroup designated as, “57 Current and Former Elected Prosecutors and Attorneys\\nGeneral, and Former U. S. Attorneys and U. S. Department of Justice Officials in\\nSupport of Appellant/Respondent,” for their insightful amici curiae briefs.\\n to not charge certain offenses would be a gross abuse of discretion, the trial court\\n\\ndenied the motion. Thereafter, the trial court denied Gonzalez’s request for a\\n\\ncertificate of immediate review, and Gonzalez filed a “Confession to Judgment” (the\\n\\n“Confession”) pursuant to OCGA § 9-12-18 (a).2 It is from the Confession that she\\n\\nnow appeals the trial court’s denial of her motion to dismiss.3 On appeal, Gonzalez\\n\\ncontends that the trial court erred in finding that Miller had standing to bring the\\n\\nmandamus action, and also sets forth several other procedural and substantive\\n\\narguments challenging the trial court’s denial of her motion to dismiss the mandamus\\n\\npetition.\\n\\n      “The grant or denial of mandamus relief . . . lies largely in the discretion of the\\n\\npresiding judge. This Court will not interfere with a trial court’s decision granting\\n\\nmandamus relief absent a showing that the court manifestly abused its discretion.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      2\\n       “Either party has a right to confess judgment without the consent of his\\nadversary and to appeal from such confession without reserving the right to do so in\\ncases where an appeal is allowed by law.” OCGA § 9-12-18 (a).\\n      3\\n        This case was transferred from the Supreme Court of Georgia upon its\\ndetermination that the issues presented on appeal were not within the Court’s subject\\nmatter jurisdiction. See Gonzalez v. Miller, Case No. S23A0994 (decided July 25,\\n2023).\\n                                           2\\n (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Burke County v. Askin, \\n294 Ga. 634\\n, 637 (2) (\\n755\\n\\nSE2d 747\\n) (2014).4\\n\\n      The facts as alleged in the mandamus petition demonstrate that Gonzalez\\n\\ncommenced her role as district attorney on January 1, 2021. At that time, Gonzalez\\n\\nissued a public memorandum entitled “Fairness and Equity in the Western Judicial\\n\\nCircuit District Attorney Office” in which she detailed certain policies, including\\n\\nchanges in the charging of simple possession of marijuana cases (the “January\\n\\nMemo”). Gonzalez advised that the district attorney’s office would no longer charge\\n\\ncertain offenses including, simple possession of marijuana offenses, simple possession\\n\\nof user-quantities of drugs other than marijuana, or possession of “drug-related\\n\\nobject[s].” Gonzalez subsequently issued an updated memorandum on February 8,\\n\\n2022, in which the policies regarding the charging of marijuana cases were removed\\n\\nand instead included the directive, in pertinent part, that the office “will not charge\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      4\\n         Where the trial court reviews an official’s “exercise of discretion . . . the\\ncorrect standard of review on appeal with respect to the mandamus order [is] whether\\nthere is any evidence supporting the decision of the local [official], not whether there\\nis any evidence supporting the decision of the superior court.” (Citation and\\npunctuation omitted.) Burke County v. Askin, 294 at 637 (2), n. 4.\\n                                           3\\n simple possession of user-quantities of drugs for the primary goal of attaining a\\n\\nconviction for said offenses or for recommending imprisonment.”\\n\\n      Miller thereafter filed the subject application for writ of mandamus, as\\n\\namended, asserting that Gonzalez\\n\\n      has been unwilling to perform her statutory duties. On day one of taking\\n      office, [Gonzalez] announced her refusal to prosecute all crimes\\n      committed in violation of a clear statutory duty[]and her oath of office[.]\\n      Beyond her intentional refusal to perform her statutory duties,\\n      [Gonzalez] has taken numerous actions which amount to gross abuses of\\n      discretion. [Gonzalez’s] refusal to perform her duties has led to (a)\\n      insufficient staffing of her office, (b) her hiring of under-qualified and/or\\n      ethically suspect assistant district attorneys – resulting in failures to\\n      timely review and appropriately indict, accuse, transfer, or dismiss cases,\\n      failures to competently try violent felonies, and a mistrial in a rape case\\n      for willful prosecutorial misconduct, (c) her failure to convene enough\\n      sessions of grand juries and/or appear before grand juries; (d)\\n      approximately one hundred fifty (150) cases about to be dismissed for\\n      failure to prosecute; and, perhaps more importantly, (e) failure to\\n      properly assist victims of serious crimes. The Court should issue a writ\\n      of mandamus to compel [Gonzalez] to perform her duties of office\\n      prescribed by OCGA § 15-18-6.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           4\\n       Miller’s prayer for relief requested that Gonzalez be required to “comply with\\n\\nher statutory duties under OCGA § 15-18-6 and that if she fails to comply with the\\n\\ntrial court’s order, she be held in contempt of court.”\\n\\n      In her subsequently filed motion to dismiss the application, Gonzalez\\n\\nmaintained that pursuant to OCGA § 9-11-12 (b) (1), the trial court did not have\\n\\nsubject matter jurisdiction over matters regarding her professional competence, and\\n\\nthat Miller did not have standing to pursue the mandamus action because he was\\n\\nseeking to enforce a public right rather than a private right in which he had a special\\n\\ninterest. Gonzalez also asserted that the application should be dismissed on the merits\\n\\nbecause Miller had failed to state a claim pursuant in OCGA § 9-11-12 (b) (6) in that\\n\\nthe mandamus action sought to improperly compel performance of a general course\\n\\nof conduct and continuous duties rather than a specific act.\\n\\n      At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Miller argued, among other things, that\\n\\nGonzalez’s January Memo reflecting her directive that no simple possession or\\n\\ntruancy cases would be prosecuted was an “intentional and willful disregard of a duty\\n\\nto prosecute a certain category of crime,” rather than a discretionary act of declining\\n\\nto prosecute an individual crime. According to Miller, while he admittedly did not\\n\\n\\n                                           5\\n have standing to assert that Gonzalez should prosecute a particular person for a\\n\\nparticular crime, he had standing to challenge the directive based on the public right\\n\\nunder OCGA § 15-18-6 requiring a district attorney to “prosecute all indictable\\n\\noffenses.”5 Moreover, he asserted that such a directive manifested a “gross abuse of\\n\\ndiscretion.”\\n\\n      In response, Gonzalez pointed out that the January Memo had been updated the\\n\\nfollowing year to remove the possession language at issue, but that, even so, the\\n\\nJanuary Memo had not outright banned the prosecution of marijuana possession or\\n\\ntruancy, but instead reflected that the right to prosecute those categories of cases was\\n\\nreserved at her discretion rather than absolute.\\n\\n      Following the hearing, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding\\n\\nthat Miller had standing as a citizen to bring an action to enforce a public right, and\\n\\nthat a policy to not enforce duly enacted laws is a dereliction of duty and that “if\\n\\n[Gonzalez] has adopted such a policy, she has grossly abused her discretion.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      5\\n        OCGA § 15-18-6 (5) provides, in pertinent part, that the duties of district\\nattorneys include, “to draw up all indictments or presentments, when requested by\\nthe grand jury, and to prosecute all indictable offenses.”\\n                                           6\\n       In response to the trial court’s subsequent denial of her request for a certificate\\n\\nof immediate review, Gonzalez filed the Confession pursuant to OCGA § 9-12-18 (a)\\n\\nin which she\\n\\n      confess[ed] to the judgment being entered granting the relief sought in\\n      the First Amended Application for Writ of Mandamus that a writ of\\n      mandamus be issued “requiring [Gonzalez] to comply with her statutory\\n      duties under OCGA § 15-18-6.” Other than as expressly admitted in her\\n      Answer or First Amended Answer, [Gonzalez] does not admit any\\n      factual allegation or legal conclusion of the First Amended Application\\n      for Writ of Mandamus.\\n\\n\\n(Footnote omitted.) Gonzalez then filed a notice appeal from the Confession.\\n\\n      1. First, as always, “[i]t is incumbent upon this Court to inquire into its own\\n\\njurisdiction.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Ledford v. Mobley, \\n321 Ga. App. 761\\n,\\n\\n761 (\\n743 SE2d 461\\n) (2013). OCGA § 9-12-18 (a) establishes the right “to appeal from\\n\\nsuch confession without reserving the right to do so in cases where an appeal is\\n\\nallowed by law.”6\\n\\n\\n      6\\n       Because the confession of judgment has primarily been used in circumstances\\nof a monetary judgment, it is unclear – and, given the circumstances in this case, we\\nneed not determine – whether Gonzalez’s Confession is, in effect, an appealable\\njudgment, or whether the trial court must enter a judgment therefrom. See Information\\nBuying Co. v. Miller, \\n173 Ga. 786\\n, 791 (\\n161 SE 617\\n) (1931) (finding that “[a] confession\\n                                           7\\n        In her Confession, Gonzalez “[c]onfessed to judgment being entered granting\\n\\nthe relief sought [in the petition]. . . [and] that a writ of mandamus be issued”\\n\\nrequiring her to comply with her statutory duties, but Gonzalez refused to “admit any\\n\\nfactual allegation or legal conclusion” included in the petition. T h u s , a l t h o u g h\\n\\nseeming to confess to the judgment, and in effect the issuance of a writ of mandamus,\\n\\n\\nof judgment is the substitute for a verdict;” that “[a] judgment must be regularly\\nentered upon a confession of judgment, and that [t]he confession itself is not the judgment\\nof the court”) (emphasis supplied); Whitley v. Southern Wholesale Corp., \\n45 Ga. App.\\n445\\n (\\n164 SE 903\\n) (1932) (“The confession amounts to no more than an admission .\\n. . , and an agreement that judgment shall be taken thereon when it can properly be\\nrendered.”) See also Thomas v. Bloodworth, \\n44 Ga. App. 44\\n, 46 (\\n160 SE 709\\n) (1931)\\n(noting that “[t]he expression ‘confession of judgment,’ as contained in the code\\nsection, has reference to the act of the defendant whereby he admits or confesses the\\nright of the plaintiff to take a judgment against him, and not to the entering up, or\\nrendition of, the judgment itself which is rendered upon the defendant’s confession of\\njudgment”) (emphasis supplied). Cf. Wade v. Combined Mutual Casualty Co., \\n201 Ga.\\n318\\n, 321 (4) (\\n39 SE2d 681\\n) (1946) (addressing refusal by justice of the peace to accept\\nconfession of judgment and file an appeal to a jury in the superior court, and noting\\nthat “[t]here is no law requiring a justice [of the peace] to enter up a formal judgment\\non a confession of judgment before the right of appeal would accrue”); Huff v.\\nWhitner, Manry Co., \\n8 Ga. App. 25\\n, 26 (\\n68 SE 463\\n) (1910) (reviewing dismissal of\\nappeal from a confession of judgment in a [justice of the peace] court based on the\\nsuperior court’s conclusion that “the confession of judgment is not a judgment of the\\ncourt, from which an appeal could have been entered,” and finding that “[OCGA §\\n9-12-18] expressly provides that an appeal can be entered from a confession of\\njudgment. There is no law requiring a justice [of the peace] to enter up a formal\\njudgment on a confession of judgment before the right of appeal would accrue. In fact\\nit is well settled, that an appeal by consent may be entered without any judgment\\nwhatever; and this is the general practice”).\\n                                            8\\n Gonzalez instead qualifies and narrows the Confession to the extent that the judgment\\n\\nis meaningless, as it provides no factual basis for the issuance of the writ of mandamus.\\n\\nOur Supreme Court of Georgia has found a confession of judgment defective when\\n\\nthe terms of the judgment are not agreed upon by the parties, or which requires that\\n\\n“something else [be] done, or some further understanding.” Lea v. Yates, ]\\n40 Ga. 56\\n,\\n\\n59 (1869). In Yates, the Supreme Court found invalid a confession of judgment that\\n\\nleft the sum of the debt blank, and concluded that given the defect, “there was nothing\\n\\nto sustain the judgment.”Id.\\n\\n      In that same vein, we cannot say that the Confession at issue, in which Gonzalez\\n\\nexpressly declines to admit to the material factual and legal assertions in Miller’s\\n\\nmandamus petition is, in effect, a valid confession of judgment pursuant to OCGA §\\n\\n9-12-18 (a). Gonzalez has not cited to any authority which permits the tailoring of a\\n\\nconfession of judgment in such a manner, and we have found none. Thus, as the\\n\\nConfession is defective, it cannot provide a basis for an appeal under OCGA § 9-12-18\\n\\n(a) or the subsequent exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction. See Fein v. Chenault, \\n330\\n\\nGa. App. 222\\n, 227 (\\n767 SE2d 766\\n) (2014) (“A necessary prerequisite for a direct\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           9\\n appeal is that the judgment or order appealed from be . . . otherwise appealable.”).\\n\\nThus, the appeal is dismissed.\\n\\n      2. Given this disposition, we need not consider Gonzalez’s remaining\\n\\nenumerations of error.\\n\\n      Appeal dismissed. Gobeil and Pipkin, JJ., concur.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         10\\n ')]"

The trial court's order includes a finding that husband earned gross monthly income of $5,483.56, approximately 65 percent of the parties' combined income. After determining a basic child support obligation of $1,582 for the parties' two minor children, the court calculated husband's pro rata share of the basic child support obligation to be $986.75. As evidenced in Schedule E attached to the court's order, however, the court applied a parenting time deviation of $434.66, reducing husband's monthly child support obligation to $552.09. See OCGA § 19-6-15(i)(2)(K). Husband does not on appeal challenge the court's decision to deviate from the presumptive child support obligation. Instead, he contends the trial court erred by failing to explain how the court calculated the deviation and failing to include express findings that the deviation was in the best interests of the children and would not seriously impair his ability to provide for the children. We agree.\\nBecause the trial court's order in this case was entered after July 1, 2008, the revised child support guidelines in OCGA § 19-6-15, including the 2008 amendments thereto, are applicable.

Based on her constitutional\\n\\narguments, Appellant asked the trial court to vacate the\\n\\nGrandparent Visitation Order and “declare OCGA § 19-7-3 facially\\n\\nunconstitutional and [unconstitutional] as applied here.”\\n\\n     After Appellees answered the petition, the trial court held a', metadata={'source': 'opinion_text/9481025_CRARY v.

Palmer, Katherine E. Fagan, McDonough, for appellant.\\nEdea M. Caldwell, McDonough, for appellee.\\nTHOMPSON, Justice.\\nRaymond and Jessica Turner were married in 1999 and had two children. Raymond filed for divorce in January 2008. The parties reached a partial settlement agreement which provided, inter alia, that husband and wife would share joint legal and physical custody of their two minor children, the custody arrangement being structured so husband is to have physical custody of the children from Friday a.m. until Tuesday a.m., and wife is to have physical custody from Tuesday a.m. through Friday a.m., with exceptions for holidays and other special occasions. Husband also agreed to pay wife $11,000 representing her interest in the marital residence. Left unresolved and submitted to the trial court for determination were issues of child support and the division of extracurricular expenses. The parties waived a hearing, and after an in-chambers conference, the court entered a final judgment and divorce decree which incorporated the partial settlement agreement, ordered husband to pay $552.09 in monthly child support, and apportioned the expenses for the children's extracurricular activities two-thirds to husband and one-third to wife. This Court granted husband's application for discretionary review pursuant to the Family Law Pilot Project.[1]\", metadata={'source': 'opinion_text/1327652_Turner v. Turner.txt'})]}\n"
