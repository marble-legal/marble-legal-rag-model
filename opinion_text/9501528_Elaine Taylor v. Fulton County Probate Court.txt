The Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order:

A24D0314. ELAINE TAYLOR et al v. FULTON COUNTY PROBATE COURT.

      This application stems from probate court proceedings in which the court
appointed Elaine Taylor as guardian and conservator for her adult daughter Lauren
Taylor after Lauren was injured while working at a horse show. On March 11, 2024,
Elaine and Lauren (“Applicants”) filed this application for discretionary appeal
seeking review of seven probate court orders appointing temporary substitute
guardians and/or conservators, and a separate probate court order approving the
settlement of Lauren’s workers’ compensation claim and establishing a special needs
trust.1 These orders were entered between November 1, 2019, and October 26, 2021.
      We lack jurisdiction because the application is untimely. To be timely, an
application for discretionary review must be filed within 30 days of entry of the order
at issue. OCGA § 5-6-35 (d). The requirements of OCGA § 5-6-35 are jurisdictional,
and this Court cannot accept an application for appeal not made in compliance
therewith. Boyle v. State, 
190 Ga. App. 734
, 734 (
380 SE2d 57
) (1989). The instant
application was untimely filed more than two years after entry of the most recent
challenged order.2

      1
        Appellants filed this application in the Supreme Court, which transferred the
case to this Court. See Case No. S24D0737 (Mar. 27, 2024).
      2
       On February 11, 2022, at Lauren’s request and the recommendation of her
temporary substitute conservator, the probate court transferred this matter to a
probate court in Missouri, where Lauren resided. In that order, the court also
dismissed three notices of appeal to superior court that Applicants had filed in
       In their application, Applicants also seek an extension of time to file the
application, but this request is also untimely and must be denied. See Court of Appeals
Rule 31 (h) (“No extensions of time will be granted to file a discretionary application
unless a motion for extension is filed on or before the application due date.”)
Accordingly, the application is hereby DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.
Applicants’ motion to strike the response brief of Lauren’s former employer’s
workers’ compensation insurance carrier, American Zurich Insurance Company, is
DENIED AS MOOT.

September and November 2021. It does not appear that these appeals were ever
docketed in superior court. In any event, any appeal from the February 11, 2022 order
would also be untimely and subject to dismissal.
