The Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order:

A24A1492. WILLIE G. SMITH v. WALTON RESIDENTIAL SERVICES.

      This case began as a dispossessory proceeding in magistrate court. Following
an adverse ruling, defendant Willie Smith appealed to the superior court, which
granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. Smith then appealed directly
to this Court. We lack jurisdiction.
      Appeals from superior court decisions reviewing lower court decisions must be
initiated by filing an application for discretionary review. OCGA § 5-6-35 (a) (1), (b);
Bullock v. Sand, 
260 Ga. App. 874
, 875 (
581 SE2d 333
) (2003). “Compliance with the
discretionary appeals procedure is jurisdictional.” Smoak v. Dept. of Human Resources,
221 Ga. App. 257
, 257 (
471 SE2d 60
) (1996). Smith’s failure to follow the proper
procedure deprives us of jurisdiction over this direct appeal, which is hereby
DISMISSED.
