The Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order:

A24D0331. WASHINGTON DAVIS v. SHUKURA L. INGRAM, JUDGE.

      Based on the extremely limited application materials, it appears that
Washington Davis filed a mandamus petition in the superior court against Judge
Shukura Ingram, seeking summary judgment in his favor in a different action. The
superior court dismissed the petition, ruling that Davis was not entitled to mandamus
relief. Davis then filed a timely application for discretionary review in the Supreme
Court,1 which transferred the matter here upon finding no basis for jurisdiction there.
See Case No. S24D0787 (Apr. 11, 2024).
      OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (7) permits a direct appeal from a judgment “granting or
refusing to grant mandamus[.]” See Carson v. Brown, 
348 Ga. App. 689
, 690 (1) (a)
(
824 SE2d 605
) (2019). No provision of the discretionary appeal statute, OCGA § 5-6-
35, appears to apply here.
      We will grant a timely application for discretionary appeal if the lower court’s
order is subject to direct appeal. See OCGA § 5-6-35 (j). Accordingly, this application
is hereby GRANTED, and Davis shall have ten days from the date of this order to file
a notice of appeal with the superior court. The clerk of the superior court is
DIRECTED to include a copy of this order in the record transmitted to the Court of
Appeals.

        Although Davis’s filing was titled “Petition for a Writ of Mandamus,” the
Supreme Court interpreted it as an application for discretionary review of the superior
court’s order. We will do likewise.
