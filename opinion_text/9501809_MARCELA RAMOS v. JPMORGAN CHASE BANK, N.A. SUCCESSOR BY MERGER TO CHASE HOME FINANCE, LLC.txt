The Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order:

A24A1358. MARCELA RAMOS v. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.
    SUCCESSOR BY MERGER TO CHASE HOME FINANCE, LLC et al.

      In this civil action, plaintiff Marcela Ramos filed suit against defendants
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Barrett Daffin Frappier Turner & Engel, LLP. On
July 19, 2023, the trial court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss and directed
the entry of final judgment under OCGA § 9-11-54 (b). Ramos filed a motion for
reconsideration, which the trial court denied on September 7, 2023. On October 4,
2023, Ramos filed the instant appeal. We, however, lack jurisdiction because the
appeal is untimely.
      A notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of an appealable order.
OCGA § 5-6-38 (a). The denial of a motion for reconsideration is not appealable in its
own right, see Bell v. Cohran, 
244 Ga. App. 510
, 511 (
536 SE2d 187
) (2000), and the
filing of such a motion does not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal. See
Cheeley-Towns v. Rapid Group, 
212 Ga. App. 183
, 183 (1) (
441 SE2d 452
) (1994). The
proper and timely filing of a notice of appeal is an absolute requirement to confer
jurisdiction upon an appellate court. See Couch v. United Paperworkers Intl. Union, 
224
Ga. App. 721
, 721 (
482 SE2d 704
) (1997). Here, Ramos filed her notice of appeal 77
days after the trial court’s order dismissing the action, and her subsequent request for
reconsideration of that ruling did not extend the time for filing an appeal.
 Accordingly, this appeal is hereby DISMISSED as untimely.
