Court of Appeals
of the State of Georgia

                                        ATLANTA,____________________
                                                 May 22, 2024

The Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order:

A24A0179. MONTE DAVIS v. LAND-RON, INC. et al.

      In 2018, Monte Davis filed this negligence action naming multiple entities as
defendants, including Land-Ron, Inc. and Intercontinental Hotels Group Resources,
Inc. (“IHG”). Davis subsequently filed a motion seeking to substitute HH TRS FP
Portfolio, LLC as a defendant in place of IHG. On October 10, 2019, the trial court
entered an order dropping IHG from the case, but denying the addition of HH TRS
FP Portfolio, LLC as a party defendant. Davis then filed a “motion to add HHC TRS
FP Portfolio, LLC” as a party-defendant. The trial court entered an order denying
that motion on December 10, 2019. To contest those adverse rulings, Davis filed a
notice of appeal on July 6, 2023.1 As explained below, because Davis’s notice of appeal
was not filed within 30 days of any appealable decision or judgment, this Court lacks
jurisdiction.


      1
       In his notice of appeal, Davis states that “[he] files his Notice of Appeal from
the Order Denying Motion To Substitute Parties, which was entered on October 10,
2019 and the Order Denying Motion To Add a Party Defendant, which was entered
on December 10, 2019.” Similarly, in his appellate brief, Davis contends in the
“ENUMERATION OF ERRORS” section:
      1. The Trial Court erred in entering the Order, which erroneously denied
      the . . . Motion to Substitute Proper Party Defendant; and
      2. The Trial Court erred in entering the . . . Order, which erroneously
      denied the Appellant’s . . . Motion to Add HHC TRS FP Portfolio, LLC
      (“HHC”) as a Party Defendant.
                                           1
        “The proper and timely filing of a notice of appeal is an absolute requirement
to confer appellate jurisdiction on an appellate court.” (Citation and punctuation
omitted.) Perlman v. Perlman, 
318 Ga. App. 731
, 739 (4) (
734 SE2d 560
) (2012). As
a general rule, to obtain a direct appeal, “[a] notice of appeal shall be filed within 30
days after entry of the appealable decision or judgment complained of[.]” OCGA §
5-6-38 (a). Here, the notice of appeal was filed more than three years after the
complained of orders were entered.


       Davis nevertheless posits that “this Court has appellate jurisdiction over this
matter pursuant to OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1).” He cites that (defendant) Land-Ron, Inc.
meanwhile moved for summary judgment; that the trial court denied that motion; and
that this Court concluded in an unpublished decision that Land-Ron, Inc. was entitled
to summary judgment and thus reversed the trial court’s judgment. See Land-Ron,
Inc. v. Davis, ___ Ga. App. __ (Case No. A23A0319) (June 9, 2023) (hereinafter
“Land-Ron I”). Davis asserts that, after this Court issued the remittitur,2 the
remittitur was filed in the trial court’s clerk’s office on July 3, 2023, and that he filed
his notice of appeal on July 6, 2023.


       Even accepting, for the sake of argument, Davis’s assertion that his notice of
appeal was filed three days after the filing of the remittitur in the trial court, the notice
of appeal failed to perfect jurisdiction of this appeal. The statutory provision upon
which Davis relies authorizes direct appeals only from “final judgments, that is to say,


       2
        This Court’s records in Land-Ron I confirm that the remittitur was issued on
June 27, 2023. See generally Young v. Jones, 
140 Ga. App. 66
, 68 (
230 SE2d 32
)
(1976) (on motion for rehearing) (reciting that “this court will take judicial notice of
its own records, and will of its own motion, or at the suggestion of counsel, inspect the
records of this court in a former appeal of the same case”) (citation and punctuation
omitted).
                                             2
 where the case is no longer pending in the court below[.]” (Emphasis supplied)
OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1). Thus, even presuming that Land-Ron, Inc. was the sole
remaining defendant when this Court was deciding Land-Ron I, Davis has cited no
authority supporting his premise that, after an appellate court reverses a trial court’s
judgment, a direct appeal may lie from the mere filing of the remittitur by the trial
court’s clerk’s office. And we find none.


      Rather, we are bound by Supreme Court of Georgia’s precedent explaining that


      [t]he trial court . . . was re-invested with jurisdiction when the Court of
      Appeals reversed [the denial of the motion for summary] judgment and
      caused its remittitur to be transmitted to and filed in the clerk’s office of
      the trial court. . . . The filing of a remittitur . . . served no function except
      to notify officially the trial court that its judgment[ ] had been reversed
      and that the case[ ] [was] being sent back to that court for further action.


(Emphasis supplied.) Hagan v. Robert & Co. Assoc., 
222 Ga. 469
, 471 (1) (
150 SE2d
663
) (1966); see Holton v. Lankford, 
189 Ga. 506
, 512 (1) (
6 SE2d 304
) (1939) (“The
judgment of reversal, without more, operated only to vacate the orders and the decree
as therein stated, and to reinvest the trial court with jurisdiction, on the filing of the
remittitur in the office of the clerk of the trial court. It did just this, and nothing
more.”).


      As the Supreme Court of Georgia has explained further,




                                             3
       [OCGA § 5-6-103] declares that a decision of this court shall be certified
      under the seal of this court to the court below and shall be respected, and
      in good faith carried into full effect, by the court below. When the
      remittitur from this [C]ourt on the case’s former appearance here
      reached the trial court, the only action under our decision and judgment
      that the court below could take was to make the judgment of this court
      the judgment of the trial court and to enter an order [in accordance
      therewith].

231 Ga.
601
, 607 (
203 SE2d 173
) (1973) (citing former Code § 6-1804, which contained the
material language of OCGA § 5-6-10).4 See generally Shepherd v. Shepherd, 
243 Ga.

         See generally OCGA § 5-6-10 (“The decision of the appellate court and any
direction awarded in the case shall be certified by the clerk to the court below, under
the seal of the court. The decision and direction shall be respected and carried into full
effect in good faith by the court below. The remittitur shall contain nothing more,
except the costs paid in the appellate court.”).
      4
        Such principles are also set out in Giordano v. Stubbs, 
356 F. Supp. 1041
, 1044
(N.D. Ga. 1973) (“Under Georgia law the decision of an appellate court must be
respected and in good faith carried into full effect by the court from which the appeal
was taken, 
Ga. Code Ann. § 6-1804
 (1964), and generally the lower court fulfills this
obligation by promptly entering an order making the judgment of the appellate court
its judgment upon receipt of the remittitur. Such an order is known as a judgment on
the remittitur. If the appellate court has reversed a lower court’s denial of a motion
dispositive of a case – such as a motion to dismiss (demurrer) or a motion for summary
judgment – the entry by the lower court of a judgment on the remittitur constitutes a
final judgment and terminates the case, whereas generally in all other situations the
case continues in the lower court until final judgment.”) (citations omitted). And a
“judgment on [the] remittitur” is expressly recognized by Georgia’s cases such as
Nance v. State, 
274 Ga. 311
, 311 (
553 SE2d 794
) (2001), Yeomans v. Galbreath, 
259 Ga.
261
, 261 (
378 SE2d 864
) (1989), United Cerebral Palsy v. Dept. of Behaviorial Health,
                                            4
 253, 254-255 (
253 SE2d 696
) (1979) (explaining that when appellate court reversed the
trial court’s decision, the only action that the trial court had authority to take was to
enter an order to make the judgment of the appellate court the order of the trial court).


       As the Supreme Court of Georgia has held, “The legal effect of the reversal of
a judgment on appeal is to nullify the judgment below and place the parties in the same
position in which they were before judgment.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.)
Franklyn Gesner Fine Paintings v. Ketcham, 
259 Ga. 3
, 4 (6) (a) (
375 SE2d 848
) (1989).
Here, Davis has failed to cite – or even assert – that after the (presumed) filing of the
remittitur in the trial court, the trial court entered a final judgment in the case.5 See
OCGA § 5-6-31 (“The filing with the clerk of a judgment, signed by the judge,
constitutes the entry of a judgment within the meaning of this article.”).


       Given the lack of any appealable judgment having been entered within the
pertinent 30 day period before Davis filed his notice of appeal,6 jurisdiction of this case


353 Ga. App. 387
, 393 (
837 SE2d 533
) (2020), and Wilann Properties I, LLC v. Ga.
Power Co., 
330 Ga. App. 311
, 311 (
765 SE2d 463
) (2014).
       5
        See generally Massey v. Massey, 
294 Ga. 163
, 166 (3) (
751 SE2d 330
) (2013)
(“[A]n appellate court maintains jurisdiction over a case until it has issued the
remittitur and the remittitur has been received and filed in the clerk’s office of the
court below. Only then does the trial court regain jurisdiction to take further action
with respect to the judgment appealed.”) (citations and punctuation omitted);
Chambers v. State, 
262 Ga. 200
, 201-202 (2) (
415 SE2d 643
) (1992) (“[W]here the
appellate court has issued the remittitur and it has been received and filed in the
clerk’s office of the court below, the trial court then has jurisdiction to take further
action in the case.”).

         Our conclusion accords with other precedents requiring that a notice of appeal
be filed during the 30 day period following a written final judgment. See, e.g., Seals v.
State, 
311 Ga. 739
, 739 (
860 SE2d 419
) (2021) (“[D]ead-docketing a count leaves that
                                             5

count undecided and, thus, leaves the entire case pending in the court below. Such a
case cannot be appealed as a final judgment under OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1)[.]”)
(punctuation omitted); Curry v. State, 
248 Ga. 183
, 185 (4) (
281 SE2d 604
) (1981)
(“An oral declaration as to what the sentence shall be is not the sentence of the court;
the sentence signed by the judge is.”); Bass v. State, 
284 Ga. App. 331
, 332 (
643 SE2d
851
) (2007) (although the trial court announced at the sentencing hearing that certain
counts would be merged with others, as to each guilty verdict, “the trial court did not
either (a) enter a written sentence, or (b) enter a written notation that the count
merged into another”; the “case thus was not ripe for appeal at that time even though
the trial court did enter a written judgment of conviction and sentence on other
counts”) (citation and punctuation omitted).
      7
        There is no merit in Davis’s argument that the jurisdictional issue is controlled
by cases such as Gillen v. Bostick, 
234 Ga. 308
, 310-311 (1) (
215 SE2d 676
) (1975),
Coleman v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N. A., 
347 Ga. App. 118
, 118, n. 1 (
817 SE2d 567
)
(2018), and Mitchell v. Cancer CarePoint, 
299 Ga. App. 881
, 882, n. 1 (
683 SE2d 923
)
(2009). Those cases recognize that a prematurely filed notice of appeal may ripen
upon the subsequent filing of an appealable judgment; they do not provide further that
an interlocutory order “ripens” into a final judgment, upon the filing of a remittitur,
followed by a notice of appeal. Indeed, as noted above, this Court reversed the trial
court’s judgment in Land-Ron I, rendering the legal effect of “nullif[ing] the judgment
below and plac[ing] the parties in the same position in which they were before
judgment.” (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Franklyn Gesner Fine Paintings, 
259
Ga. at 4
 (6) (a).
       What is more, it is pursuant to OCGA § 5-6-34 (d) that “all judgments, rulings,
or orders rendered in the case which are raised on appeal and which may affect the
proceedings below shall be reviewed and determined by the appellate court, without
regard to the appealability of the judgment, ruling, or order standing alone and without
regard to whether the judgment, ruling, or order appealed from was final or was
appealable by some other express provision of law contained in this Code section, or
elsewhere[.]” (Emphasis supplied.) But that provision may be invoked only where an
“appeal is taken from an order or judgment pursuant to OCGA § 5-6-34 (a), (b), or (c).”
(Emphasis supplied). At this juncture, Davis has not satisfied that predicate; nor has
he made any claim that OCGA § 5-6-34 (d) provides a jurisdictional basis for this
                                           6
    Consequently, this appeal is hereby DISMISSED.8

         The appellate record does not contain a copy of the remittitur as filed in the
court below. Davis has thus submitted to this Court a motion to supplement the
appellate record therewith. Such supplementation, however, would serve no purpose.
        As we have explained above, even accepting arguendo that the remittitur was
duly filed in the trial court as asserted by Davis, jurisdiction did not perfect for lack of
a final judgment thereafter entered by the trial court. Therefore, Davis’s motion to
supplement is hereby DISMISSED AS MOOT.
