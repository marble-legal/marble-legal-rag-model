    S24Y0566. IN THE MATTER OF SHAQUANDRA A. WOODS.

        PER CURIAM.

        This disciplinary matter is before the Court on the Petition for

Voluntary Suspension of License Pending Appeal filed by

Shaquandra A. Woods (State Bar No. 579239) seeking the voluntary

suspension of her license to practice law pending the outcome of an

appeal of her criminal conviction, filed prior to the issuance of a

formal complaint under Bar Rule 4-227 (b) (2). In her petition,

Woods, who has been a member of the Bar since 2019, admits that

on December 8, 2023, in the United States District Court for the

Southern District of Georgia, she was found guilty of conspiracy to

commit wire fraud, a felony, under 
18 USC § 1349
 and that her

sentencing is scheduled for March 28, 2024. Woods admits that her

conviction violates Rule 8.4 (a) (2) of the Georgia Rules of
 Professional Conduct found in Bar Rule 4-102 (d). The maximum

penalty for a violation of Rule 8.4 (a) (2) is disbarment. Woods

represents that she plans to appeal her conviction. Woods states

that she will notify the State Bar of the final disposition of her

appeal within ten days of that disposition and that she will also

comply with the requirements of Bar Rule 4-219 (b). Woods prays

that the Court accept her Petition for Voluntary Suspension of

License Pending Appeal. In its response, the State Bar recommends

that this Court accept Woods’s Petition for Voluntary Suspension of

License Pending Appeal.

     We have reviewed the record and agree to accept Woods’s

Petition for Voluntary Suspension of License Pending Appeal. See

In the Matter of Huber, 
314 Ga. 426
 (
877 SE2d 243
) (2022) (accepting

petition seeking an order of interim suspension of license pending

appeal of criminal convictions); In the Matter of McIver, 
303 Ga. 802


(
815 SE2d 53
) (2018) (accepting petition seeking voluntary

suspension of license pending outcome of appeal of criminal

convictions). Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that Shaquandra A.

                                 2
 Woods be suspended from the practice of law in this State pending

the outcome of her direct appeal and until further order of this

Court. Woods is ordered to notify the State Bar’s Office of General

Counsel in writing within 10 days of the final disposition of her

direct appeal. Woods is reminded of her duties pursuant to Bar Rule

4-219 (b).

     Petition for interim suspension accepted. Suspension until
further order of this Court. All the Justices concur.
