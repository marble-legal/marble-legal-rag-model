A24A1398. BRUTON v. GEICO CASUALTY COMPANY

      Elmaree Bruton filed a notice of appeal from the trial court’s order granting

20 days later, on May 20, 2024. Bruton failed to file a brief by the deadline and never
asked for an extension of time to file the brief. Accordingly, Bruton’s appeal is
hereby DISMISSED for failure to file a brief. See Court of Appeals Rule 23 (a).
