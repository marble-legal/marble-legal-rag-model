The Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order:

A24A1438. RAY TAYLOR v. KENNETH WILLIAMS.

      Ray Taylor sued Kenneth Williams to recover for damages arising from a motor
vehicle collision. Williams did not file a timely answer or discovery responses. He later
moved to open default and withdraw his admissions. The trial court denied the
motion, ruling that Williams’s liability was established as a matter of law, but he was
entitled to a trial on damages. Taylor then filed a motion to enforce a settlement
agreement. The trial court denied that motion, as well as Taylor’s subsequent motion
to vacate the denial, and Taylor appeals. We lack jurisdiction.
      OCGA § 5-6-34 (a) (1) authorizes direct appeals only from “final judgments,
that is to say, where the case is no longer pending in the court below[.]” Because the
issue of damages has not been resolved, Taylor was required to comply with the
interlocutory appeal procedures of OCGA § 5-6-34 (b) in order to obtain appellate
review at this juncture.1 See Underwood v. Dunn, 
215 Ga. App. 252
, 252-253 (
451 SE2d
129
) (1994).
      In his notice of appeal, Taylor suggests that he may appeal directly under the
collateral order doctrine, which “permits appeals from a small category of decisions
that are (i) conclusive, (ii) that resolve important questions separate from the merits,
and (iii) that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the
underlying action.”Expedia v. City of Columbus, 
305 Ga. App. 450
, 452 (1) (
699 SE2d

        In fact, Taylor did file an application for interlocutory appeal, which we
denied. See Case No. A23I0217 (June 2, 2023),
 600) (2010) (punctuation omitted). “[T]he collateral order doctrine has application
to only a very small class of interlocutory rulings.” Rivera v. Washington, 
298 Ga. 770
,
775 (
784 SE2d 775
) (2016) (citation and punctuation omitted). The denial of a motion
to enforce a settlement agreement is not one of those rulings, as it may be reviewed
effectively on appeal after final judgment. See Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct,
511 U. S. 863
 (114 SCt 1992, 128 LE2d 842) (1994) (under the federal collateral order
doctrine, the refusal to enforce a settlement agreement did not supply a basis for an
immediate appeal).
      Because Taylor had no right of direct appeal from the trial court’s interlocutory
order denying his motion to enforce a settlement agreement, this appeal is hereby
DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.
