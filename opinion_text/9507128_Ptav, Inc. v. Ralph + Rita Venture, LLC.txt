The Court of Appeals hereby passes the following order:

A24A1474. PTAV, INC. v. RALPH + RITA VENTURE, LLC.

       On April 4, 2024, the superior court issued an order dismissing as untimely
defendant PTAV, Inc.’s appeal from a magistrate court judgment in this dispossessory
proceeding. PTAV then filed both a timely application for discretionary review and,
on April 15, 2024, a notice of appeal. We denied PTAV’s discretionary application on
the merits. See PTAV, Inc. d/b/a “Red Martini” v. Ralph + Rita Venture, LLC, Case
No. A24D0311 (May 9, 2024). The direct appeal has been docketed as the current
case, no. A24A1474. We lack jurisdiction for two reasons.
       First, this appeal is untimely. While a notice of appeal generally may be filed
within 30 days of entry of the order sought to be appealed, appeals in dispossessory
actions must be filed within 7 days of the date the judgment was entered. See OCGA
§ 44-7-56 (b) (1); Radio Sandy Springs v. Allen Road Joint Venture, 
311 Ga. App. 334
,
335-336 (
715 SE2d 752
) (2011). PTAV’s April 15 notice of appeal was untimely filed
11 days after the April 4 judgment it seeks to appeal.
       Second, because we rejected PTAV’s challenges to the April 4 judgment in
Case No. A24D0311, the current appeal is barred by the law of the case. See Ross v.
State, 
310 Ga. App. 326
, 327 (
713 SE2d 438
) (2011) (“[A]ny issue that was raised and
resolved in an earlier appeal is the law of the case and is binding on this Court . . . .”)
(citation and punctuation omitted); accord Hook v. Bergen, 
286 Ga. App. 258
, 261 (1)
(
649 SE2d 313
) (2007) (a ruling on an application for discretionary appeal acts as res
judicata in later proceedings); see also Jackson v. State, 
273 Ga. 320
, 320 (
540 SE2d
612
) (2001) (a party “is not entitled to another bite at the apple by way of a second
appeal”).
      For the above reasons, this appeal is hereby DISMISSED for lack of
jurisdiction.
